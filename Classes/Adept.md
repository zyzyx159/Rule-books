*"It's simple really. If we place the signifier here in this position, the rest of the cipher solves itself."*

— Scholar Gabel Troken, Librarium Centris, Scintilla.

The Administratum is a vast, monolithic organisation and the largest, most powerful of all the divisions that make up the Adeptus Terra. It is said the Adeptus Terra is the cogs and gears that drive the Imperium, and the Administratum is the grease and oil that smooths and coats the machinery. Without the Administratum, the gears of the Adeptus Terra would grind to a halt and the Imperium would fail.

Billions staff the Administratum, the majority of which are adepts of varying grades and specialties. Many are in hereditary positions, the titles passed down from generation to generation. Such is the immense size of the Administratum, it has been known for whole departments to become lost in a sea of complex bureaucracy only to resurface centuries later. Entire divisions have been founded and dogmatically continue to exist, even after their original intent has long since expired.

Most adepts labouring within the gargantuan vaults, forgotten archive halls or sitting at ancient, parchment-reading, logic engines are considered to be learned by Imperial standards. They range from studious librarians, who have spent their entire lives within the dusty confines of manuscript-filled archives, to younger, knowledge-hungry scholars ambitious to climb the multitudinous ranks of the Administratum.

Inquisitors and their agents frequently have need of such academics, archivists, curators, scribes, logisters, translators, and all manner of specialists in lore. Adepts become involved with an Inquisitor in many ways: some may already be in service within the Inquisition, others may unwittingly cross paths during an Inquisitor's investigation, but the majority of adepts are seconded from the Administratum. For an ageing scholar, used to a rigid and dogmatic routine, entering the employ of an Inquisitor is an intimidating experience. Some are reluctant, but see it as an important duty that must be fulfilled. Others can become resentful, making it clear they are only in service out of fear and loss of status rather than any idealist sense of saving the Imperium. Not all react negatively: Some, often younger, adepts see it as an opportunity, a rare chance to leave the overbearing structures of the Administratum and quench their thirst for curiosity, and study forbidden knowledge.

In the field, adepts are rarely armed with anything more than an autopistol; firepower is someone else's job. They are present to give sage tactical advice, unlock codes, confirm the existence of STC data or brief on local customs and rituals. Their role may not be in the forefront of a firefight but it is no less pivotal or dangerous. Whilst other Acolytes can secure a heavily defended data-crypt with firepower and psychic force, someone needs to download and decipher the data from the terminal in the midst of the combat.

Adepts may be thought of as meek when compared to other Acolytes, but they have access to one of the most powerful weapons in the 41st Millennium—knowledge.

# **Archivist Advances**

*"Throne blind you boy, fetch those books before I use your hide for a binding!"*

Archivists keep manuscripts and tend the needs of Sages, scurrying between tottering bookshelves and datacrypts, ever with an eye to escaping their servitude.

# **Scrivener Advances**

*"Dharkins, your illuminations are positively Rabeliean. You'll do well; just not here."*

Scriveners have wormed their way into a position of trust, whence they may actually deal with scrolls, books and data-slates directly. Of course, they are the primary oppres sors of Archivists, as is only right and proper.

# **Scribe Advances**

*"A scribe is always useful. Knowledge can make the difference between life and death, particularly if you send the scribe in first…"*

Scribes are vessels of knowledge, skilled in the byzantine art of extracting information from all manner of sources. Many secretly fear they will never rise further within the ranks of the Administratum, hence they are naturally keen to take risks to get ahead.

# **Inditor Advances**

*"If you've a mind to dig to the bottom of something, an inditor is invaluable. If they don't know it, they can find it out for you. If they can't find it… well, you're probably not meant to know it anyway."*

Inditors are trusted members of the Administratum, having been initiated into some of its deeper secrets. Even the lore of other Adepta is not beyond their scrutinising gaze.

*"Them chirurgeons issa odd bunch. Watch it if they offers ta cut ya fer free. Iss the way they looks at yer as they're rummagin' in yer guts. Kinda like yera cross 'tween an essper iment anna pork lunch."*

Chirurgeons investigate the secrets of the human form, studying the cryptic chambers of the heart, the enigmas of flesh and bone, and, of course, the moist grey mysteries of the brain.

A Scholar is in full bloom of his powers, wise, learned and skilled in getting results from the almighty machine that is the Administratum. Should they avoid peevish theo retical debate and infighting, Scholars become respected and mighty indeed.
