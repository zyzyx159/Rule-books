*"Use the talent that your toil has made, for what use a solar-cell in the shade?"*

— Catuldynus, *The Once Pure Hive*

An Acolyte's duties will see him performing all sorts of deeds in the name of the Inquisition. From fighting debased mutants to investigating ancient xenos ruins, Acolytes will need a wide array of abilities to survive in the 41st Millennium.

Just like Skills, Talents represent some of the things your character can do. These are often things your character has learnt through training, such as running faster or being able to shrug off near-fatal wounds. Sometimes they are special or unique powers, such as Psychic Talents, or miraculous Tech-Priest abilities. Unlike Skills, you usually don't need to test against Talents to activate them. Most are always active. In fact, there are many Talents that will give you bonuses to your Skill Tests, or even allow you to use Skills in different ways.

Deciding which Talents you would like to give your character is an enjoyable process, but it can be very hard to choose. Fortunately, the advancement schemes in **Career Paths** provide plenty of help.
## **Gaining Talents**

During character creation you will automatically receive some Talents, and be asked to choose between others. Once you've started playing, you can use Experience Points to purchase new Talents from the various Advancement Schemes in your Career Path.
## **Talent Groups**

Some of the listed Talents are actually groups of related abilities. Talent groups are listed under one entry for the sake of ease, but each one is a separate ability that must be acquired individually. For example, Basic Weapon Training (Las) and Basic Weapon Training (Bolt) are different Talents. If a character wanted to effectively use both a lasgun and a boltgun they would require both Talents.
## **Prerequisites**

Some Talents may require the character to meet some form of prerequisite before they can be acquired. This is usually a certain level in a Characteristic or another Skill or Talent, though sometimes a Talent may require something more dramatic, such as the character being able to use Psychic Powers.

†*Denotes Talent Group*
‡*Denotes Ascendant Talent*
### **Air of Authority**
**Prerequisites:** Fellowship 30

You exude a natural aura of command, instilling subservience in all around you. On a successful Command Test, you may affect a number of targets equal to 1d10 plus your Fellowship Bonus. Such is the authority in your voice that even those who are not in your service jump to attention when you speak. You may attempt to get non-servants to follow your commands by making a [Command](skills.md#command) Test with a –10 penalty. This Talent has no effect on hostile targets, and usually only affects NPCs.

**Special:** The appearance of authority influences others in many ways. Those that act with confidence and resolve encounter far fewer questions than the insecure. When making a Deceive Test, you may voluntarily take a –10 penalty to affect a number of targets equal to 1d10 plus your Fellowship Bonus.
If you choose to invoke your rank as a member of the Inquisition you suffer no penalty for attempting to command those not officially under your authority. Note that this may have adverse side effects if used against recidivists and others who are of a strong anti-Imperial persuasion.
### **Ambidextrous**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 30

You can use either hand equally well. You do not take the normal –20 penalty for making attacks with your secondary hand.

**Special:** If you have the [Two-Weapon Wielder](talents.md#two-weapon%20wielder) Talent, the penalty for making attacks with both weapons in the same Turn drops to –10.
### **Armour of Contempt**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 40

You drape yourself in the armour of scorn and hatred. Whenever you would gain Corruption Points, reduce the amount you would earn by 1, to a minimum of 0. In addition, you may Test Willpower as a Free Action to ignore the effects of your accumulated Corruption for one Round.
### **Arms Master**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 30, Basic Weapon Training in at least two groups of weapons

Such is your skill with a gun that you are able to pick up a completely unfamiliar weapon and use it with some proficiency. You can use ranged weapons you do not have training in with a –10 penalty rather than the usual –20.
### **Assassin Strike**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 40, Acrobatics

You are like a serene dancer when engaged in combat, leaping and spiralling between dismembered corpses like some butcher ballerina. Whenever you engage an opponent and make a melee attack, you may make an [Acrobatics](skills.md#acrobatics) Test to move at your Half Move rate as a Free Action. Further, your opponent does not receive the customary free attack resulting from this move either. You may only take this additional move once per Round.
### **Autosanguine**

Ancient and blessed technology of the Mechanicus—or perhaps some more alien or corrupt artifices—flows through your blood. A series of implants in your cardiac system filter impurities from the blood while greatly stimulating your body's natural restorative processes. When applying healing, you are always considered Lightly Wounded, and heal at an increased rate, removing 2
points of Damage per day instead of the usual 1. Additionally, your autosanguinators also improve your body's compatibility with your other implants and augmetics, all but eliminating pain and discomfort than can be caused where the metallic components press against your weak fleshy parts. For the faithful of the Mechanicus, this represents a great bound towards singularity with “the true flesh“.
### **Basic Weapon Training**
**Talent Groups:** Bolt, Flame, Las, Launcher, Melta, Plasma, Primitive, SP

You have received Basic Weapon Training in a group of weapons, and can use them without penalty. This class of weapons includes most two-handed weapons that are ordinarily fired from the shoulder, such as lasguns and shotguns.
### **Battle Rage**
**Prerequisites:** Frenzy Talent

Indomitable will and great self control have allowed you to master the beast within, tempering its rage while keeping a level head. You may spend Reactions to Parry while Frenzied.
### **Berserk Charge**

You have learned to fully utilise the whole force of your momentum behind your weapon blows. When you hurl yourself headlong into combat few can evade your attacks. When you use the [Charge](combat.md#charge%20%28full%20action%29) Action you gains a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill instead of the usual +10.
### **Binary Chatter**

You have finely optimised your grasp of Techna-Lingua to become quite adept at controlling servitors. You gain a +10 bonus to any Tests made to communicate with servitors and other high-level logis-controlled apparatuses.
### **Blademaster**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 30, Melee Weapon Training

Your mastery of sword and knife is unsurpassed and your blade always strikes true. When attacking with a bladed weapon, including chain swords, power axes, and even humble daggers, you may re-roll one missed attack per Round.
### **Blind Fighting**
**Prerequisites:** Perception 30

Years of practice and heightening your other senses have allowed you to fight in close quarters without the benefit of sight. You take half the usual penalties when fighting in environments that obscure your vision, such as fog, smoke and darkness.
### **Bulging Biceps**
**Prerequisites:** Strength 45

Whereas a weaker man would be sent flying when using powerful weapons, your strong physique allows you to remain standing and unleash devastating firepower with remarkable ease. Assuming you have a compatible heavy weapon you can attack using Semi-Auto Burst and Full Auto Burst without [bracing](combat.md#brace%20heavy%20weapon%20%28half%20action%29), and do not suffer the customary –30 penalty to your Ballistic Skill Test for failing to brace either.
### **Catfall**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 30

You are nimble and balanced, like a cat, and are able to fall much greater distances without harm than the common man. Whenever you fall, you may Test Agility as a Free Action. On a success, and for every further degree of success, you may reduce the distance fallen by a number of metres equal to your Agility Bonus for the purposes of determining the Damage from the fall. Additionally, you gain a +20 bonus to [Acrobatics](skills.md#acrobatics) Tests made [to jump down](movement.md#standing%20vertical%20jumps).
### **Chem Geld**

A variety of chemical and surgical treatments, or possibly just a massive force of will, have rendered you immune to most mundane temptations. Seduction attempts against you automatically fail, and the Difficulty of all other Charm Tests made against you increase by one step (a **Challenging (+0) Test** becomes **Difficult (–10)** and so on). When you take this Talent you gain one Insanity Point.
### **Cleanse and Purify**
**Prerequisites:** Basic Weapon Training (Flame) Talent

You can control the flow of your flamer with uncanny skill, the blasts of fire moving like an adroit dance partner. Targets exposed to your flamer attacks take a –20 penalty to their Agility or Dodge Tests avoid being hit or set on fire by the attack.
### **Combat Formation (Ascendant Talent)
Prerequisites:** Intelligence 40

You can direct your allies to be prepared for danger, planning out their actions for many contingencies if attacked. Before [rolling Initiative](combat.md#combat%20overview), all other members of your group may choose to use your Intelligence Bonus for all Initiative rolls instead of their individual Agility Bonuses.
### **Combat Master**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 30

Through a combination of reflex and perception you are able to keep many more opponents at bay in melee than a lesser skilled warrior might. Opponents fighting you in hand-to-hand gain no bonuses for outnumbering you.
### **Combat Sense
Prerequisites:** Perception 40

You have the ability to consciously recognise the proddings of your subconscious as it reacts to your preternaturally sharp senses, giving you an edge that mere speed cannot match. You can use your Perception Bonus in place of your Agility Bonus when [rolling Initiative](combat.md#combat%20overview).
### **Concealed Cavity**

You have a small compartment hidden upon your person. This might be a clandestine pouch hidden under a flap of synthetic skin, or a chamber fitted into one of your cybernetic implants. You may conceal one small item, no bigger than a closed fist, within this cavity. The compartment may be discovered on a **Difficult (–10) Search Test**. If the searcher employs additional technology, such as a medicae scanner or chem-sniffer, this difficulty is reduced to **Ordinary (+10)**.
### **Corpus Conversion**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating 2

You can siphon the health of your physical body to fuel your psychic powers. You may voluntarily (and permanently) lose one point of Toughness in order to gain a bonus 1d10 on your next Power Roll. You may sacrifice up to your Willpower Bonus in Toughness in this manner in a single round, gaining an additional 1d10 to the Power Roll for each point of Toughness sacrificed.

While using this Talent you may choose to burn a Fate Point. If you do, the sacrificed Toughness becomes Characteristic Damage instead of permanently lost, and [may be recovered normally](injury%20and%20healing.md#removing%20characteristic%20damage).
### **Counter-attack**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 40

Your lightning ripostes would be a thing of beauty—if they were slow enough to be seen. When you successfully Parry an opponent's attack, you may immediately make an attack against that opponent using the weapon with which you Parried. This attack is a **Hard (–20) Test**, but is a Free Action to make.
### **Crack Shot**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 40

You are able to target your shots at the places where they will inflict more harm. When your ranged attack causes Critical Damage, add +2 to the total Damage dealt.
### **Crippling Strike**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 50

You are able to land your blows in the spot where they will inflict the most harm. Whenever your melee attack causes Critical Damage, add +4 to the total Damage dealt.
### **Crushing Blow**
**Prerequisites:** Strength 40

You can focus your entire body movement into close combat attacks. You add +2 to Damage you inflict using melee weapons.
### **Dark Soul**

Prolonged exposure to darkness and wicked behaviour has acted as an inoculation against all that is foul, granting you greater resilience against the physical manifestation of corruption. Whenever you are called to make a Malignancy Test, you take half the normal penalty. See **The Game Master** for details on Corruption.
### **Deadeye Shot**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 30.

You always hit an opponent right between the eyes—or wherever else you intend—making you a truly dreaded marksman. When making a [Called Shot](combat.md#called%20shot%20%28full%20action%29), you take only a –10 penalty instead of the usual –20.
### **Decadence**
**Prerequisites:** Toughness 30

Either through mental and physical conditioning, or long years of abusive frivolities, your body has built up a tolerance to many inebriants and drugs. When drinking alcohol or similar intoxicants, you do not pass out until you have failed a number of Toughness Tests equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. You also gain a +10 bonus to all Tests made to resist the effects of addiction and building immunity.
### **Deflect Shot**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 50

You are able to knock aside Thrown weapons and shots fired from Primitive weapons. You may spend a Reaction to Parry an incoming ranged attack so long as the attack is from a Primitive or Thrown weapon.

The deflected weapon or shot [flies off in a random direction](combat.md#missing). In the case of certain weapons, such as a throwing knife or grenade, you may attempt to knock it in the direction of your choice (the distance is still determined randomly) by making a **Difficult (–10) Ballistic Skill Test** immediately after successfully Parrying the attack.
### **Die Hard**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 40

It takes more than most to finish you off. When you suffer from [Blood Loss](injury%20and%20healing.md#blood%20loss), you may roll a number of times equal to half your Willpower Bonus (minimum 2, round down) to stave off death.
### **Disarm**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 30

You can wrest weapons from an opponent’s hands, either through practised technique or brute force. When engaged in melee with an opponent you may use a Full Action to disarm your foe by making an Opposed Weapon Skill Test. If you beat your opponent, he drops his weapon to his feet. Should you get three or more degrees of success, you can take your opponent's weapon instead, provided you have a free hand to hold it with.
### **Discipline Focus**
**Talent Groups:** Biomancy, Divination, Pyromancy, Telekinetics, Telepathy
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating 3

You devote a great deal of time and effort into mastering your Psychic Discipline. Choose one of your Disciplines. You gain a +2 to Power Rolls made to manifest any powers of this Discipline.
### **Disturbing Voice**

Your voice has particularly baleful or menacing qualities, causing others to quail before it. This may be due to infrasonic cadences produced by a vox synthesiser, thorough training in the art of interrogation, or just an inborn air of malice. You gain +10 bonus to all [Intimidate](skills.md#intimidate) or [Interrogation](skills.md#interrogation) Tests when you speak, but also take a –10 penalty to Fellowship-based Tests when dealing with persons who are likely to be off put by your frightening manner (psykers, small children, nervous Grox and so on). You also gain a +10 bonus to [Command](skills.md#command) Tests against any individuals or groups you have successfully Intimidated in the past.
### **Double Team**

You have great experience from chaotic mass combats and swirling melees under your belt. When ganging up on an opponent with an ally, you gain an additional +10 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests. If you both have this Talent you both gain an additional +10 bonus, for a total of +20. This bonus is in addition to the normal bonuses gained from outnumbering an opponent.
### **Dual Shot**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 40, Two-Weapon Wielder

You are able to focus the firepower of two guns to maximise the impact. When armed with two pistols, you can fire both simultaneously as a Full Action. Make a single Ballistic Skill Test. On a success, you hit the target with both shots.

As you are firing both pistols as a single attack, you may take an [Aim](combat.md#aim%20%28Half%20or%20Full%20Action%29) Action before firing to gain a +10 or +20 bonus to your Ballistic Skill Test. A red-dot laser sight, targeter, or similar upgrade mounted on one of the weapons provides half its listed bonus; if both weapons have the same upgrade, it provides its full bonus as normal.

You do not suffer the normal –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill for wielding two weapons when using this Talent.

If you hit, the target's Armour gets applied as normal to both hits individually, but his Toughness only counts once against the remaining combined Damage of both hits. A successful Dodge Test from the target will avoid both shots.
### **Dual Strike**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 40, Two-Weapon Wielder

Your skill with melee weapons is great enough to strike the same point with two weapons at once. When armed with two melee weapons, you can attack with both simultaneously as a Full Action. Make a single Weapon Skill Test. On a success, you hit the target with both weapons.

As you are swinging both weapons as a single attack, you may take an Aim Action before letting loose to gain a +10 or +20 bonus to your Weapon Skill Test.

You do not suffer the normal –20 penalty to Weapon Skill for wielding two weapons when using this Talent.

If you hit, the target's Armour gets applied as normal to both hits individually, but his Toughness only counts once against the remaining combined Damage of both hits. A successful Dodge Test from the target will avoid both blows.
### **Duty Unto Death
Prerequisites:** Willpower 45

Your will or faith can sustain you when your flesh is weak. You can ignore the effects of injury, [Fatigue](injury%20and%20healing.md#fatigue), and [Stunning](injury%20and%20healing.md#stunned) during combat. This Talent does not prevent the Damage, but allows you to temporarily ignore its effects for the duration of the combat. Death still affects you normally if you sustain too much Critical Damage or any other lethal effect.
### **Electrical Succour**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

You call upon the sacred flow of energy to replenish your weak flesh. Whilst in contact with a functioning, powered machine, or fully charged battery or power cell, you may make an **Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test**. If you succeed, remove one level of [Fatigue](injury%20and%20healing.md#fatigue), plus one additional level of Fatigue for each degree of success. If you succeed by two or more degrees, you also fully recharge your Potentia Coil. This takes one minute of meditation and ritual incantation to activate.
### **Electro Graft Use**

You have the ability to use an electro graft to access data points and commune with machine spirits. This grants you a +10 bonus to [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore), [Inquiry](skills.md#inquiry), or [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Tests whilst connected to a data point.
### **Enemy
Talent Groups:** Academics, Adepta Soroitas, Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Enforcers, Feral Worlders, Government, Hivers, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Inquisition, Middle Classes, Military, Navigators, Nobility, Rogue Trader, Underworld, Void Born, Workers

The opposite of [Good Reputation](talents.md#good%20reputation), you are particularly despised by a specific social group or organisation. You suffer a –10 penalty to any Fellowship-based Tests when dealing with this group. This Talent is cumulative with any other situational penalties that you may be incurring.

This Talent may be awarded by the GM if appropriate to the adventure or campaign, or if you have otherwise earned serious ire from that group. It may also be removed with an Elite Advance and the approval of the GM if you have redeemed your standing with the group in question.
### **Energy Cache**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Potentia Coil)

You have learnt how to focus the power stored within your Potentia Coil with great efficiency. You automatically pass the Toughness Test to avoid gaining [Fatigue](injury%20and%20healing.md#fatigue) when using Luminen Talents, such as [Luminen Charge](talents.md#luminen%20charge) and [Luminen Blast](talents.md#luminen%20blast). If the Talent does not allow a Test, such as when using [Luminen Shield](talents.md#luminen%20shield) for the second time in a 24 hour period, you still gain Fatigue from that as usual.
### **Enhanced Bionic Frame (Ascendant Talent)**
**Prerequisites:** Machinator Array

Your already impressive bionic body structure is steadied by a gyro-array guided by advanced targeting systems linked to your growing machine spirit. You gain the [Auto-stablilised](traits.md#auto-stabilised) Trait.
### **Exotic Weapon Training**
**Talent Groups:** All Exotic Weapons

You are trained to use a particularly obscure or rare type of weapon, allowing you to use armaments few others have ever seen. Weapons requiring this unique Talent are noted in their
descriptions. Unlike other kinds of weapons training this Talent applies only to a single weapon, such as a needle pistol or graviton gun, not an entire class of weapons.
### **Favoured by the Warp**
**Prerequisite:** Willpower 35

Whenever a Power Roll triggers [Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena), you may roll two dice on **Table: Psychic Phenomena** and take the more favourable result.
### **Fearless**

Whether through fervent loyalty, a stern demeanour tempered through hard experience in horrifying situations, or a derangement of the mind, you are impossible to frighten or unnerve. You are immune to the effects of [Fear](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear) and [Pinning](combat.md#pinning), but disengaging from combat or backing down from a fight requires a successful on a Willpower Test.

Panic does not only apply to combat, and a fearless Acolyte can also steel their resolve during covert operations and deception. When made in a stressful situation, such as when detection could have dire consequences, you lower the difficulty of [Security](skills.md#security) or [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Tests by one-step, but must make a Willpower Test to cease tampering.
### **Feedback Screech**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Respirator Unit)

By muttering illogical formulae under your breath, you are able to foment rebellion within your vox synthesisers. Your audio circuits protest in a screeching blast of noise, shocking and distracting others in equal measure. All creatures with a sense of hearing, except daemonic and machine-based ones, within a 30 metre radius must make a Willpower Test or lose a Half Action on their next Turn as they shudder, swear, cover their ears or otherwise involuntarily react to the horrid cacophony. Using this ability is a Free Action, but may not be used again for 1+1d10 Rounds, minus your Toughness Bonus (minimum 1), while your audio circuits reset.
### **Ferric Lure**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

Tapping into your Potentia Coil's ability to shape and alter magnetic fields, you can call an unsecured metal object within your field of vision to your hand. You may summon objects of up to 1 kilogram per point of your Willpower Bonus from up to 20 metres away. Using this Talent requires a Full Action and a successful Willpower Test.
### **Ferric Summons**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil), Ferric Lure

Extensive practice of your magnetism-manipulating techniques have improved your Ferric Lure. You may now summon objects weighing up to 2 kilograms per point of your Willpower Bonus and from up to 40 metres away. Use of this Talent is still a Full Action which requires a successful Willpower Test.
### **Flagellant**

You have dedicated your pain to the service of the Emperor. Each day, you must spend twenty minutes praying and inflicting 1 point of Damage upon yourself. You may not treat this Damage or allow it to be healed. Once you have castigated your flesh, you gain a +10 bonus to Willpower Tests made to resist mind control or [Malignancy](fear%20and%20damnation.md#the%20malignancy%20test). Additionally, if you have the [Frenzy](talents.md#frenzy) Talent, you may enter a frenzied state as a Free Action. Should you fail to flagellate yourself on any given day, you take a –5 penalty to all Tests due to shame and guilt.
### **Foresight**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 30

Your adept grasp of logic and analysis are powerful tools that do for you what Tarot and the bones claim to do for more superstitious types. By careful consideration of all the possible consequences, and examination of all evidence and information, you can often identify the best path for success. You may spend ten minutes contemplating a problem or situation to gain a +10 bonus to your next relevant Intelligence-based Test.
### **Frenzy**

Your temper and passion, or just bloodlust, boil just below the surface of your psyche. Your rationality mostly keeps it in check, but you can nevertheless incite yourself into a frothing rage in just a few moments' notice. You must spend one Round fuelling your anger—howling like a beast, flagellating yourself, or screaming litanies of hatred against your foes. The next round you lose control and go berserk, gaining a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness, and Willpower, but suffering a –10 penalty to Ballistic Skill and Intelligence. You must attack the nearest enemy in melee combat if possible. If you are not engaged with the nearest enemy, your rage compels you to move to the nearest enemy as expeditiously as possible and engage them in melee. 

You do not have to take any obviously suicidal actions, such as leaping off a building to engage an enemy on the ground, but you may trigger hidden traps or charge around a corner into an ambush when you ordinarily would have tested the floor or peeked around said corner first. In general, you must take any actions that give you a reasonable opportunity to engage in melee with the nearest enemy, even if they may not be the most tactically sound ones. While Frenzied you are immune to [Fear](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear), [Pinning](combat.md#pinning), being [Stunned](injury%20and%20healing.md#stunned), and the effects of [Fatigue](injury%20and%20healing.md#fatigue), but you may not [Parry](combat.md#parry%20%28reaction%29), retreat, or flee. Whenever possible you must use the [All Out Attack](combat.md#all%20out%20attack%20%28full%20action%29) Action.

You remain Frenzied for the duration of the combat. Unless you have a Talent that allows you to do so, you may not use Psychic Powers whilst Frenzied. Some creatures, particularly certain types of daemons, do not need to spend a Round inciting the rage—they are either permanently Frenzied or can Frenzy at will.
### **Furious Assault**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 35

Your savage blows follow one another in quick succession, raining down on your opponents like fiery bolts. Whenever you hit an opponent whilst using the [All Out Attack](combat.md#all%20out%20attack%20%28full%20action%29) Action, you may spend your Reaction to make an extra attack against the same enemy, or if your previous attack felled him, another adjacent enemy. This attack is made with the same bonuses or penalties as the All-Out Attack you just made.
### **Good Reputation**
**Prerequisites:** Fellowship 50, Peer
**Talent Groups:** Academics, Adepta Soroitas, Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Enforcers, Feral Worlders, Government, Hivers, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Inquisition, Middle Classes, Military, Navigators, Nobility, Rogue Trader, Underworld, Void Born, Workers

You are well respected within a specific social group or organisation. You gain an additional +10 bonus to Fellowship-based Tests when dealing with this group. This Talent is cumulative with the [Peer](talents.md#peer) Talent, for a total of a +20 bonus.
### **Guardian (Ascendant Talent)**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 40

Experience from years of serving as a bodyguard allow you to put himself in the line of fire with flawless precision. You may sacrifice all of your Actions for the next Round to switch places with an ally within 2 metres (as long as there is no obstruction between you and your ally). This may be done at any time, even interrupting another character's Turn. You become the target of any attacks previously targeting your ally. This Talent may not be used more than once per combat.
### **Gun Blessing**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

With a few prayers and a wave of the hand your sacred ability to subtly affect ferrous materials allows you to un-jam a number of guns equal to your Intelligence Bonus, so long as they are within a 10 metre radius from you. A successful Intelligence Test indicates that you have appeased the spirits of the weapons in question. This blessing is a Full Action.

A [weapon un-jammed](combat.md#weapon%20jams) with Gun Blessing becomes functional again at the end of your Turn, and does not lose any ammunition or require additional reloading due to your great affinity with its machine spirit.

Note that this Talent cannot be used on foul weapons that lack a machine spirit, such as those of xenos manufacture and certain weapons wielded by the forces of Chaos.
### **Gunslinger**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 40, Two-Weapon Wielder

You are ready for anything when you have a pistol in each hand. When so armed, you reduce the penalty for fighting with two weapons by –10. If you have the [Ambidextrous](talents.md#ambidexxtrous) Talent, you take no penalty at all.
### **Hard Target**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 40

Supremely light on your feet, long years in the line of fire have taught you how to duck and weave through the flow of a gunfight. Whenever you make a [Run](combat.md#run%20%28full%20action%29) or [Charge](combat.md#charge%20%28full%20action%29) Action, your opponents suffer a –20 penalty to their Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit you until the end of your next Turn. This penalty stacks with that caused by Running, for a cumulative total of –40.
### **Hardy**
**Prerequisites:** Toughness 40

Your strong constitution rebounds from shock or injury surprisingly quickly. For the purposes of removing Damage, you are always considered to be [Lightly Wounded](injury%20and%20healing.md#lightly%20wounded).
### **Hatred**
**Talent Groups:** Criminals, Cult (specific), Daemons, Heretics, Mutants, Pirates, Rogue Trader (specific), Psykers, Xeno (specific)

You have reason to truly hate one particular race or organisation, and your malice hones your melee attacks against them. When selected as an Advance from your Career Path this Talent will generally apply to a certain race or group—some common examples are listed above, and others may be available at the GM's discretion. When fighting opponents that qualify as members of that group, you gain a +10 bonus to all Weapon Skill Tests made to attack them.
### **Heavy Weapon Training**
**Talent Groups:** Bolt, Flame, Las, Launcher, Melta, Plasma, Primitive, SP

You know how to use one particular type of heavy weapon, and can use weapons of that type without penalty. Heavy weapons tend to possess great firepower, but most must be wielded with two hands and generally need to be [braced](combat.md#brace%20heavy%20weapon%20%28half%20action%29) before firing.
### **Heightened Senses**
**Talent Groups:** Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch

Either excellent genetics or extensive training have made one of your senses superior to those of your peers. Each time you gain this Talent it will apply to one of the five senses, thereafter you gain a +10 bonus to any Tests specifically involving that sense. Thus, Heightened Senses (Sight) would apply to an Awareness Test to see a distant flock of shale crows, but not to something as general as a Ballistic Skill Test with any ranged weapon or a Weapon Skill Test simply because you're using your eyes to line up the attack.
### **Hip Shooting**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 40, Agility 40

Your prowess with ranged weapons is such that you can still fire accurately without using the sights, giving you the ability to shoot whilst on the move. As a Full Action, you may move up to your Full Move rate and make a single attack with a ranged weapon. This attack can only be a single shot—no automatic fire.
### **Hotshot Pilot**
**Prerequisites:** Any Pilot Skill, Agility 40

You can pilot vehicles as if they were extensions of your own body. You may only select this Talent if you have obtained at least one [Pilot](skills.md#pilot) Skill as an Advanced Skill. You treat all other Pilot Skills as Basic Skills, and receive a +10 bonus to the Pilot Tests for Skills you already possess.

Note that this applies retroactively to any Pilot Skills you acquire as Advanced Skills after taking this Talent.
### **Independent Targeting**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 40

You have developed your peripheral vision and situational awareness to a point where you can fire in two directions within a split second. When firing two weapons as part of a single action, the targets need not be less than 10 metres apart.
### **Infused Knowledge (Ascendant Talent)**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 40

You have been infused with a great wealth of lore and erudition, either through punishing noetic techniques or by arcane methods kept secret by the guardians of technology and knowledge. You treat all [Common](skills.md#common%20lore) and [Scholastic Lore](skills.md#scholastic%20lore) Skills as untrained Basic Skills. This Talent also provides a +10 bonus to any Tests involving Common or Scholastic Lore Tests for which you already possess the Skill, including new Skills gained after taking this Talent.
### **Insanely Faithful**

You take refuge in your madness. When rolling to determine the effects of [Shock](fear%20and%20damnation.md#shock%20and%20snapping%20out%20of%it), you may roll twice and take the better result.
### **Inspire Wrath**
**Prerequisites:** Fellowship 30

You know just the turn of phrase to incite individuals or groups to rage against others. Your rhetoric grants a +20 bonus to Interaction Tests when inspiring hatred or anger, and can affect double the number of individuals. This Talent can be combined with [Master Orator](talents.md#master%20orator) to further increase the number of listeners affected.
### **Into the Jaws of Hell**
**Prerequisites:** Iron Discipline

You inspire loyalty and devotion in your followers such that they would follow you on a boarding action against xeno corsairs or into the heart of the dread Tyrant Star itself. Whilst you are visible to them your minions are immune to [Fear](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear) and [Pinning](combat.md#pinning).
### **Iron Discipline**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 30, Command

Your stern demeanour and firm but fair leadership inspires loyalty in your followers. So long as you are visible to them, your minions may re-roll failed Willpower Tests made to resist [Fear](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear) and [Pinning](combat.md#pinning). This Talent can affect a number of targets equal to your Willpower Bonus, but they must be under your authority. Other player characters can benefit from Iron Discipline if you are formally leading the group.
### **Iron Jaw**
**Prerequisites:** Toughness 40

You are made of sturdy stuff and can bounce back from blows that would leave others sprawled out on the floor. If you become [Stunned](injury%20and%20healing.md#stunned) you may end the effect immediately with a successful Toughness Test.
### **Jaded**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 30

Witnessing mind-bending weirdness and human depravity beyond the ken of most has acclimatised you to the worst horrors. You never gain Insanity Points from the sight of blood, death, violence, or other mundane sources of terror. Supernatural forces—such as [Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena) and the presence of daemons—still affect you as normal, however.
### **Last Man Standing**
**Prerequisites:** Nerves of Steel

You have developed a sixth sense about hails of gunfire, and can sense gaps and pauses in the lethal rain of bullets and las blasts sailing overhead. You are immune to [Pinning](combat.md#pinning) except by Heavy and vehicle-mounted weapons, and add +1 AP to the value of any cover you are using to protect yourself from ranged attacks.
### **Leap Up**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 30

A combination of athletic ability and speed allow you to spring to your feet in virtually any circumstance. You may [stand up](combat.md#stand/mount%20%28half%20action%29) as a Free Action.
### **Light Sleeper**
**Prerequisites:** Perception 30

The slightest change in conditions or disturbance brings you from sleep to full awareness in a moment. You are always assumed to be awake, even if you are asleep, for the purposes of making [Awareness](skills.md#awareness) Tests, being [Surprised](combat.md#combat%20overview), or getting up in a hurry. However, your sleep is not deep and is often interrupted by trivial inconveniences, resulting in a less-than-cherry disposition.
### **Lightning Attack**
**Prerequisites:** Swift Attack

Your speed with weapons is legendary, allowing you to launch flurries of attacks that savagely punish your enemies. As a Full Action, you may make another melee attack on your Turn. This stacks with the attack granted by [Swift Attack](talents.md#swifft%20attack), allowing you to make a total of three melee attacks. The use of Lightning Attack may not be combined with [Dual Strike]. If you have the [Two-Weapon Wielder](talents.md#two-weapon%20wielder) Talent and are wielding two weapons, the benefits of Lightning Attack apply to one melee weapon. You may make a single attack with the other weapon as normal (including a ranged attack if the other weapon happens to be a gun).
### **Lightning Reflexes**

You always expect trouble, even in the most innocuous situations, allowing you to act at a moment's notice when needed. When rolling for [Initiative](combat.md#combat%20overview), you add twice your Agility Bonus to the roll of 1d10. If you have the [Unnatural Agility](traits.md#unnatural%20characteristic%20%28X%29) Trait, add +1 to the Trait before factoring the bonus into your Initiative roll.
### **Litany of Hate**
**Prerequisites:** Hatred (any)

You are so impassioned in your hatred that you can rouse others to similar heights of emotion. As a Full Action, you may make a [Charm](skills.md#charm) Test to extend the effects of your Hatred Talent to those around you. A successful Test grants a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests to one target per point of your Fellowship Bonus when fighting your hated foes. The effects last for the duration of the encounter.
### **Logis Implant**

You may utilise analytical circuits to calculate trajectory and reactions to a preternatural extent. Your ability to read possible outcomes lets you anticipate the movement of your opponents. As a Reaction you may make a [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Test to activate your Logis Implant. Note that as this uses up your Reaction for the Round you may not normally Dodge or Parry until your next Turn, so use this Talent judiciously. Until the end of your next Turn, you gain a +10 bonus to all Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests. If you succeed at using this Talent you must make a Toughness Test, with failure causing you to gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Luminen Barrier**
**Prerequisites:** Luminen Shield, Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

Drawing on your training as an Electro-Priest, you can draw upon all of your power to create a shimmering barrier of pure energy, one capable of deflecting any attack. As a Full Action, you can activate a Luminen Barrier which remains active for a number of Rounds equal to your base Willpower Bonus. The barrier has a Rating equal to your base Willpower Characteristic. While the barrier is active, if you are struck by a Ranged or Melee attack, but before Damage is rolled, you may attempt to negate the attack entirely by rolling 1d100 and comparing it to the barrier’s Rating. If the roll is equal to or under the Rating, the attack is nullified in a brilliant flash of light. If the roll is over the Rating, the attack penetrates the barrier and causes Damage as normal.

On a d100 roll of 01–05, the barrier still stops the attack, but is overloaded in the process. It instantly collapses, and you must pass a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue. You can use Luminen Barrier a number of times equal to your Willpower Bonus every 24 hours; however, upon the second activation of the ability within 24 hours, and upon each subsequent activation in that time, you gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Luminen Blast**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

With the proper prayer and projection of will, you are able to strike at the enemies of the Omnissiah. Using your electoo inductors, you may create a crackling ball of bio-electrical energy that you may fling at your foes. On a successful Ballistic Skill Test, you may direct this energy against a single target within 10 metres. The target takes Energy Damage equal to 1d10 plus your Willpower Bonus. Use of this Talent is a Standard Attack which takes one Half Action to perform.

Each time you use this Talent, you must pass a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Luminen Charge**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil).

You have learnt how to lend your life force to technology. On a successful Toughness Test you may use your bio-electrical field to recharge or power machinery. This takes one minute of meditation and ritual incantation to activate. The Difficulty of the Toughness Test varies depending on the nature of the technology, as follows:

| Difficulty       | Example                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ordinary (+10)   | Chemical battery, glow globe                            |
| Challenging (+0) | Lasgun charge pack, data-slate, personal heater         |
| Difficult (–10)  | Shuttle electronics, air conditioning unit, servo skull |
| Hard (–20)       | Land speeder engine, emplaced hololith, servitor        |
| Very Hard (–30)  | Industrial press, plasma reactor, xenos tech            |
No matter the power bestowed by the Omnissiah, some systems are either too large or too alien for this Talent—the GM will be the final judge. Each time you use this Talent, you must pass a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Luminen Flare**
**Prerequisites:** Luminen Blast, Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

You have mastered the ability to channel your will through the Potentia Coil into a powerful blast of energy that brings the fury of the Omnissiah to all who might stand in your way. On a successful Ballistic Skill Test, you may direct this energy at a single target within 20 metres. The attack deals 1d10 plus your Willpower Bonus in Energy Damage with the Blast (X) Quality, where X equals your Willpower Bonus. Use of this Talent is a Standard Attack which takes one Half Action to perform. 

Each time you use this Talent, you must pass a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Luminen Shield**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

Focusing your energy in all directions at once, you are capable of creating a hazy field of static, strong enough to turn aside incoming blows and stop weapons fire in its tracks. As a Full Action, you may activate a Luminen Shield which remains active for a number of Rounds equal to your
base Willpower Bonus. The shield has a rating equal to half of your Willpower Characteristic, rounded up (e.g. if your Willpower is 43 you would have a Luminen Shield with a Rating of 22). While the barrier is active, if you are struck by a Ranged or Melee attack, but before Damage is rolled, you may attempt to negate the attack entirely by rolling 1d100 and comparing it to the barrier’s Rating. If the roll is equal to or under the Rating, the attack is deflected, repulsed, or otherwise stopped by your Luminen Shield. If the roll is over the Rating, the attack penetrates the barrier and causes Damage as normal.

On a d100 roll of 01–04, the barrier still stops the attack, but is overloaded in the process. It instantly collapses, and you must pass a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue. You can use Luminen Shield a number of times equal to your Willpower Bonus every 24 hours; however, upon the second activation of the ability within 24 hours, and upon each subsequent activation in that time, you gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Luminen Shock**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

By focusing bio-electrical energy through your electoo inductors, you are able to directly damage your opponents. You must touch your enemy for this ability to work. If you are in combat, use of this Talent is a Half Action, and you must either make a successful Weapon Skill Test or be Grappling to deliver the attack. Each Luminen Shock deals 1d10+3 points of Energy Damage with the Shocking Quality. Each time you use this Talent, you must pass a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Luminen Surge**
**Prerequisites:** Luminen Shock, Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

You are able to channel even more power through your electoo inductors, sheathing your hands in a glowing torrent of power that can rend flesh and armour alike. You must touch your enemy for this ability to work. In combat, you must either make a successful Weapon Skill Test or be Grappling to deliver the attack. Each Luminen Surge deals 2d10+3 points of Energy Damage with the Shocking Quality. This counts as a Half Action, and each time you use this Talent, you must pass a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue.
### **Machinator Array (Ascendant Talent)**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cyber Mantle/Potential Coil/Cranial Circuitry), The Flesh is Weak

You have become much closer to the most holy of forms, adding an extensive machinator array to your existing augmetics. Your Strength and Toughness Characteristics are increased by +10 while your Agility and Fellowship are reduced by -5. Your mass increases to three times that of a normal person, and are now considered to be [Hulking]. You can no longer stay afloat or swim in water or similar liquids. Your machinator array greatly improves your combat ability: you can now mount a pistol type or one-handed close combat weapon on any Ballistic Mechadendrite or Bionic Arm you possess. You must still have the proper Talent to use your mounted weapons.
### **Maglev Grace**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Potentia Coil)

By long hours of rote learning and installation of supplemental magnetic coils, you have gained the ability of magnetic levitation, a miracle of the Omnissiah. By spending a Half Action, you may hover 20 to 30 centimetres off the ground for a number of minutes equal to 1d10 plus your Toughness Bonus. Whilst levitating you must take a Half Action each Round to concentrate on maintaining the rite. You may activate this rite whilst falling to slow your rate of descent, reducing all falling Damage to 1d10+3 Impact. Each use Maglev Grace exhausts the power stored in your potentia coil, and thus you may only use this rite once until your Potentia Coil is recharged (usually twelve hours).
### **Maglev Transcendence**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Potentia coil), Maglev Grace

Devotion to the Machine God (and further coil implants) has granted you mastery of magnetic levitation. You may now levitate for 2d10 minutes plus your Toughness Bonus, and can move up to your Run speed as a Half Action, but must still spend a Half Action each Round to maintain the rite. If you use this rite while falling and it is active upon landing you suffer no falling Damage, instead touching down gracefully with perhaps a small dust cloud to mark your arrival. Each use of this rite consumes 50% of the power stored in your Potentia Coil.
### **Marksman**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 35

Distance is no object with a gun in your hand, and you are just as adept at picking off far away targets as those nearby. You suffer no penalties for shooting at [Long](combat.md#long) or [Extreme Range](combat.md#extreme).
### **Master Chirurgeon**
**Prerequisites**: Medicae +10

Your grasp of the most sophisticated medical techniques enable you to knit flesh with deft mastery. You gain a +10 bonus on all Medicae Tests. If you are treating a Heavily or Critically Wounded patient, a successful Test heals 2 Wounds instead of the normal 1. If this character is in danger of losing a limb from a [Critical Effect](injury%20and%20healing.md#critical%20effect%20tables), you also provide the patient with a +20 bonus to the Toughness Test to resist limb loss.
### **Master Enginseer**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cyber Mantle/Utility Mechadendrite), Tech-Use +20

Your knowledge of complex machine spirits surpasses many of your brethren in the Adeptus Mechanicus. You may spend a Fate Point to automatically succeed at any [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Test. Should degrees of success be a factor, you are considered to have rolled a 01 on this Test.
### **Master Orator**
**Prerequisites:** Fellowship 30

You are skilled at speaking to large audiences. Your Fellowship Tests and Fellowship-based Skill Tests can affect 10 times the normal number of people.
### **Mechadendrite Use**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cyber Mantle/Cranial Circuitry)
**Talent Groups:** Ballistic, Manipulator, Medicae, Optical, Utility

You have been given the appropriate training, initiation and hypnodoctrination to use a particular type of mechadendrite. These undulating mechanical limbs are used for a wide variety of purposes and functions, and are an immediately recognisable aspect of a true tech-priest. Most have multiple joints or are mounted on strong servo-snakes, making them resemble segmented metallic tentacles or piston-driven insectile limbs tipped with instruments of the Omnissiah's glory. Each Talent Group covers a specific type of mechadendrite, which can assist you with exploration, repairs, combat, and so forth.
### **Meditation**

You have trained to enter a deep meditative state where you focus fully on inner contemplation and prayer to the God-Emperor. Whilst meditating you shut down unnecessary functions to refresh your body and mind. Success on a Willpower Test and 10 uninterrupted minutes of meditation removes one level of [Fatigue](injury%20and%20healing.md#fatigue).
### **Melee Weapon Training**
**Talent Groups:** Primitive, Chain, Shock, Power

You have received training in a group of hand-to-hand weaponry, and can use them without penalty.
### **Mental Fortress**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 50, Strong Minded

Your mind is a dangerous place for a psyker to tread. Whenever you are the target of a psychic attack, you force the psyker to make a Willpower Test. On a failure, the psyker takes 1d10 points of Damage plus 1 Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus. This Damage is considered Impact Damage, directed at the head (more specifically, the face). The psyker can reduce this Damage by an amount equal to his Willpower Bonus, but it ignores any Armour worn and the psyker's Toughness Bonus.

Note that this only affects Psychic Powers which attack you directly, such as Bio-Lightning or Dominate—for example, a telekinetic psyker could still fling a large piece of rockcrete at you.
### **Mental Rage**
**Prerequisites:** Frenzy

You channel your madness and hate into your Psychic Powers. You may use your Psychic Powers whilst in a Frenzied state.
### **Mighty Shot**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 40

Your familiarity with guns is such that you know just where to aim to make your target really feel it. You add +2 to Damage to all ranged weapon attacks.
### **Mimic**

You have an extraordinary ability to copy another person's voice patterns. This may be due to implanted vox synthesisers, extensive training in modulating your vocal range, or just natural talent at imitating others. You must have listened to your target for at least one hour in order to study their voice properly. You must also understand their language, and you cannot mimic the voice of a xeno or certain mutants due to physiological differences. Listeners must succeed on a **Difficult (–10) Scrutiny Test** to realise that you are not the person you are mimicking. If you have based your voice patterns on anything other than "live" conversations where you are in the same room as your target (for example, an aural recording, or listening in on a vox-terminas call from another area), the Difficulty of this Scrutiny Test is reduced to **Challenging (+0)**. 

Note this does not make you look like your target; you merely sound like them. If a listener can clearly see you are not the person you are copying, your deception automatically fails.
### **Minor Psychic Power**
**Talent Groups:** All Minor Psychic Powers

You have acquired an additional psychic ability, gaining one [Minor Psychic Power](psychic%20powers.md#minor%20psychic%20powers).
### **Nerves of Steel**

You are able to remain calm, even when bullets fly past and bombs fall around you. You may re-roll a failed Willpower Test to avoid or recover from [Pinning](combat.md#pinning). Additionally, you may choose to spend a Fate Point and become immune to Pinning until the end of your next Turn.
### **Orthoproxy**

A tiny circuit has been implanted within your skull which quietly recites various prayers for strength and guidance. Normally easily ignored, you can wilfully focus on the prayers whispered by the proxy unit when your mental fortitude is in peril. This grants you a +20 bonus to Willpower Tests made to resist mind control, interrogation, and other forms of coercion.
### **Paranoia**

You are always on the look out for danger and secretly know that the galaxy will hit you the moment you let your guard down. You gain a +2 bonus on [Initiative](combat.md#combat%20overview) rolls. In addition, the GM may secretly Test your Perception to see if you notice hidden threats. Others, however, may find your constant muttering and twitchy looks unnerving.
### **Peer**
**Prerequisites:** Fellowship 30

**Talent Groups:** Academics, Adepta Soroitas, Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Enforcers, Feral Worlders, Government, Hivers, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Inquisition, Middle Classes, Military, Navigators, Nobility, Rogue Trader, Underworld, Void Born, Workers

You know how to deal with a particular social group or organisation. You gain a +10 bonus to all Fellowship-based Tests when interacting with the group in question.
### **Pistol Training**
**Talent Groups:** Bolt, Flame, Las, Launcher, Melta, Plasma, Primitive, SP

You have received training in a group of pistols and can use them without penalty.
### **Power Well**
**Prerequisites**: Psy Rating 2

The unnatural power of the warp suffuses your being, allowing you to manifest your psychic abilities more easily. When you make a Power Roll to manifest a Psychic Power you add +1 to the result. You may purchase this Talent multiple times in accordance with your Career Advances. In this case note the number of times it's been taken after the Talent, such as Power Well 3.
### **Precise Blow**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 40, Sure Strike

You are skilled at making difficult strikes. When making a [Called Shot](combat.md#called%20shot%20%28full%20action%29) with a melee weapon, you do not incur the normal –20 penalty.
### **Prosanguine**
**Prerequisites:** Autosanguine

Through greater knowledge of your holy implants and appeals to the Omnissiah you accelerate the workings of your autosanguinators, driving their machine spirits to such speed that your wounds close visibly quickly. You must spend ten minutes in meditation and ritual incantation, during which time you may make a [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Test. If you succeed, your implants run well past their limits, healing you for 1d5 points of Damage over the course of the ten minutes. The ritual of prosanguination fails if your meditation is interrupted in any way. Additionally, if you roll a 96-100 on the Tech-Use Test, not only do you fail to activate the Prosanguine Talent, you also overstrain your autosanguinators. They cease to function for one week, during which time you are unable to use this Talent, and gain none of the benefits of the [Autosanguine](talents.md#autosanguine) Talent either. Once the week has passed the machine spirits forgive your trespass and begin to work normally again.
### **Psy Rating**

You are a psyker, able to channel the great and terrible power of the warp to manipulate the materium to better suit your desires. In game terms your power is rated on a numeric scale, where 1 represents the minimum psychic ability needed to be considered for acceptance by the Scholastica Psykana, while anything above 10 is likely beyond the limits of human control.

You may purchase increasing Psy Rating Talents in accordance with your Career Advances. Each point of Psy Rating represents your unlocking more of your psychic potential and a commensurate increase in power. See below for a detailed description of each Psy Rating Talent's benefits.

**Special:** Most Psy Rating Talents grant you a number of Psychic Powers which may be fixed in number or determined by your Willpower Bonus. Note that if your Willpower Bonus later increases, **you do not retroactively gain additional powers**. 
#### **Psy Rating 1**

You have truly grasped your latent psychic abilities. Select a number of [Minor Psychic Powers](psychic%20powers.md#minor%20psychic%20powers) equal to one-half your Willpower Bonus (round up). You gain a Psy Rating of 1, meaning you may roll one dice and add your Willpower Bonus when manifesting Psychic Powers.
#### **Psy Rating 2**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating 1

You have further advanced your knowledge of your psychic abilities. Select a number of [Minor Psychic Powers](psychic%20powers.md#minor%20psychic%20powers) equal to half your Willpower Bonus (round up). You now have a Psy Rating of 2 and may roll up to two dice plus your Willpower bonus when manifesting Psychic Powers.
#### **Psy Rating 3**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating 2

Your psychic abilities grow further in power and proficiency. You may select one [Psychic Discipline](psychic%20powers.md#the%20psychic%20disciplines), such as Divination or Telekinetics, and you gain one power of your choice from this Discipline. You also gain a number of [Minor Psychic Powers](psychic%20powers.md#minor%20psychic%20powers) equal to half your Willpower Bonus (round up). You now have a Psy Rating of 3 and may roll up to three dice plus your Willpower bonus when manifesting Psychic Powers.
#### **Psy Rating 4**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating 3

You have distinguished yourself by your skill at manipulating warp energies and the breadth of your knowledge of psychic abilities. You gain a number of Psychic Powers in any [Psychic Discipline](psychic%20powers.md#the%20psychic%20disciplines) that you know equal to half your Willpower Bonus and the same number of [Minor Psychic Powers](psychic%20powers.md#minor%20psychic%20powers) (round up). 

Alternatively, instead of gaining additional Psychic Powers from your Psychic Discipline, you may further broaden your knowledge of the psyker's gift and select one new Psychic Discipline, from which you gain a single Psychic Power. 

Regardless of your choice, you now have a Psy Rating of 4 and may roll up to four dice plus your Willpower bonus when manifesting Psychic Powers.
#### **Psy Rating 5**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating 4

You have grasped power well beyond what most sanctioned psykers ever will. You gain a number of Psychic Powers in any [Discipline](psychic%20powers.md#the%20psychic%20disciplines) that you know equal to half your Willpower Bonus (round up). 

Alternatively, you may select a new Psychic Discipline and gain one Psychic Power from it.

Regardless of your choice, you now have a Psy Rating of 5 and may roll up to five dice plus your Willpower bonus when manifesting Psychic Powers.
#### **Psy Rating 6**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating 5

Such is your extraordinary psychic ability that you may soon find yourself asked to join the ranks of the Primaris, the most elite of the Scholastica Psykana. You gain a number of Psychic Powers in any [Psychic Discipline](psychic%20powers.md#the%20psychic%20disciplines) that you know equal to half your Willpower Bonus and the same number of [Minor Psychic Powers](psychic%20powers.md#minor%20psychic%20powers) (round up). 

Alternatively, instead of gaining additional Psychic Powers from your Psychic Discipline, you may select one new Psychic Discipline, from which you gain a single Psychic Power. 

Regardless of your choice, you now have a Psy Rating of 6 and may roll up to six dice plus your Willpower bonus when manifesting Psychic Powers.
### **Psychic Power**
**Talent Groups:** All Psychic Powers

You have acquired an additional Psychic Power. You gain one power of any [Discipline](psychic%20powers.md#the%20psychic%20disciplines) you know.
### **Quick Draw**

You have practised with your weapons so frequently that they very nearly leap into your hands when the time for action comes. You can [Ready](combat.md#ready%20%28half%20action%29) as a Free Action when armed with a Pistol or Basic class ranged weapon, or a melee weapon that can be wielded in one hand. If you have the appropriate Two Weapon Wielder Talent, you may Ready a weapon in each hand.
### **Rapid Reaction**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 40

You have a hair trigger and react to danger in an instant. When [Surprised](combat.md#combat%20overview) or ambushed, if you succeed on an Agility Test you are no longer considered Surprised and may act normally.
### **Rapid Reload**

You have spent so long practising weapons drills that the bullet clips and power cells seem to guide themselves into your guns. All [reload times](combat.md#reload%20%28varies%29) are reduced by half (round down)—so a Half Action reload become a Free Action, a Full Action reload becomes a Half Action, and so on.
### **Resistance**
**Talent Groups:** Cold, Fear, Heat, Insanity, Poisons, Psychic Powers

Whether through past exposure, gruelling physical training, or luck of genetics, you are highly resistant to a particular type of hardship. When you select this Talent from your Career Advances it will be associated with a certain Talent Group. You gain a +10 bonus when making a Test to resist or avoid the object of your resistance, and may spend a Fate Point to automatically succeed.
### **Rite of Awe**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Respirator Unit)

Utilising some of the implants in your mouth and throat you may recite an infrasonic liturgy that causes awe and fear. All humans within a 50 metre radius, regardless of their ability to hear, feel a sense of dread and religious guilt. Alongside these emotional effects, all humans take a –10 penalty to their next Skill Test. Alternatively, you may instead decide to use this rite to make yourself seem more imposing, gaining a +10 bonus to your next Command or Intimidate Test on any characters within the area of effect. Affected characters may make a Willpower Test to ignore these effects. 

Whilst incanting the rite you may not talk or otherwise verbally communicate with others. The rite is two minutes long, and it is considered very bad form to break off the recitation before completion. Note that humans without auditory implants or [Heightened Senses](talents.md#heightened%20senses) cannot hear infrasonic sound, and though still affected, may not realise you are speaking.
### **Rite of Fear**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Respirator Unit)

You may recite an infrasonic dirge which causes terror within the weak. All humans within a 50 metre radius, regardless of their ability to hear, treat you as having a Fear Rating of 1. Alternatively, you may instead decide to use this dirge to make yourself seem more threatening, gaining a +10 bonus to your next Intimidate or Interrogation Test on any characters within the area of effect.

Whilst incanting the dirge you may not talk or otherwise verbally communicate with others. The rite requires two minutes of chanting, and most would not consider halting the incantations prior to their completion. Note that humans without auditory implants or [Heightened Senses](talents.md#heightened%20senses) cannot hear infrasonic sound, and though still affected, may not realise you are speaking.
### **Rite of Pure Thought**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cranial Circuitry)

You have replaced the creative half of your brain with sacred capacitance implants. You no longer feel emotion, and are instead embrace the crystal purity of logic. You are now immune to [Fear](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear), [Pinning](combat.md#pinning), and any effects that stem from emotional disturbance. Other followers of the Omnissiah will rejoice in your newfound mental freedom and clarity, but lesser humans will likely find you at least somewhat cold and distant. Should you have any [Mental Disorders](fear%20and%20damnation.md#disorders%20and%20their%20severity) that are no longer relevant the GM will replace those with appropriate new ones of approximately equal severity.
### **Rival
Talent Groups:** Academics, Adepta Soroitas, Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Enforcers, Feral Worlders, Government, Hivers, Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, Inquisition, Middle Classes, Military, Navigators, Nobility, Rogue Trader, Underworld, Void Born, Workers

Essentially the opposite of [Peer](talents.md#peer), this Talent represents aggressive competition and some animosity with a particular social group or organisation. You suffer a –10 penalty to all Fellowship-based Tests when interacting with the group in question.

This Talent may be awarded by the GM if appropriate to the adventure or campaign, or if you have otherwise earned serious ire from that group. It may also be removed with an Elite Advance and the approval of the GM if you have take suitable actions to earn the trust of the group in question.
### **Sharpshooter**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 40, Deadeye Shot

Your steady hand and careful study of ballistics allow you to place shots exactly where you want. When making a [Called Shot](combat.md#called%20shot%20%28full%20action%29) you do not incur the normal –20 penalty. This Talent replaces Deadeye Shot.
### **Sound Constitution**

You are able to absorb more damage before you begin to suffer the effects of injury. You gain an additional Wound. You may purchase this Talent multiple times in accordance with your Career
Advances. In this case note the number of times it’s been taken after the Talent, such as Sound Constitution 3.
### **Sprint**

You are able to put on a burst of speed to get out of—or into—trouble fast. When taking the [Full Move](combat.md#move%20%28half%20or%20full%20action%29) Action, you may move an extra number of metres equal to your Agility Bonus. When taking the [Run](combat.md#run%20%28full%20action%29) Action, you may double your Movement for one Round. You gain one level of Fatigue if you use this Talent two Rounds in a row.
### **Step Aside**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 40, Dodge

You are especially quick at getting out of the way of attacks. You may make one additional [Dodge](combat.md#dodge%20%28reaction%29) per Round. In technical terms, this Talent gives you a second Reaction but which may only be used to Dodge, thus allowing you to make two Dodges in a single Round. Note that you may still only attempt a single Dodge against any one attack.
### **Street Fighting**

You are adept at “gutter combat“ and fighting dirty, favouring small and manoeuvrable weapons—or even your bare hands—to hit where it hurts. When armed with a knife or similar small weapon, or fighting unarmed, you add +2 to any Critical Damage you inflict.

For the purposes of this Talent any small and light weapon that could be concealed up a sleeve counts, including more unusual weapons such as power blades and chain knives.
### **Strong Minded**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 30, Resistance (Psychic Powers)

Your mind is like a fortress guarded against psychic attack. You may re-roll failed Willpower Tests to resist any Psychic Powers that affect your mind, such as [Inflict Pain](psychic%20powers.md#inflict%20pain) or [Compel](telepathy.md#compel). Psychic Powers that have a direct physical effect, such as most [Pyromancy](pyromancy.md) and [Telekinetics](telekinetics.md) Powers, are unaffected by this Talent.
### **Sure Strike**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 30

You strike your blows with greater precision and control than most, giving you more authority over where your weapon attacks land. When determining where you hit an opponent with a melee attack, you may use the dice as you rolled them or reverse them, choosing the location you prefer. Using this Talent requires no Action and can be used as many times per Round as you can attack.
##### Example: 
*Beam rolls a 37 on his Weapon Skill Test to hit an Ork. Ordinarily, Beam would strike location 73—the right leg, but because he has the Sure Strike talent, he could choose to hit the xeno in location 37—the body, if he so prefers.*
### **Swift Attack**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 35

Your speed and martial ability allow you to land flurries of blows. As a Full Action, you can make two melee attacks on your turn. The use of Swift Attack may not be combined with [Dual Strike](talents.md#dual%20strike). If you have the [Two-Weapon Wielder](talents.md#two-weapon%20wielder) Talent and are wielding two weapons, the benefits of Swift Attack apply to one melee weapon—you may make a single attack with the other weapon as normal (including a ranged attack if the other weapon happens to be a gun).
### **Takedown**

You are adroit at incapacitating an opponent so you can take him alive. As a Half Action you may declare that you are attempting to Takedown an opponent before attacking him, making a Weapon Skill Test as normal. If you hit and would have inflicted at least 1 point of Damage, the Damage is instead ignored and your opponent must make a Toughness Test. If your opponent fails he becomes [Stunned](injury%20and%20healing.md#stunned) for one Round, giving you or your allies ample time to restrain him.

If you are performing a Stun Action, you do not suffer the normal –20 penalty to your Weapon Skill as part of that Action.
### **Talented**
**Talent Groups:** All Skills

You have a natural affinity for a particular Skill. You gain a +10 bonus to Tests when using this Skill.

You automatically gain this Talent any time you receive the same Trained Skill twice, such as from your career's Starting Skills and a Background Package.
### **Technical Knock**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 30

Your practised hand and knowledge of the proper rituals allows you to coax the stilted machine spirits of [jammed guns](combat.md#weapon%20jams) into furious action once more. You may un-jam any gun as a Half Action. A gun that is un-jammed in this fashion does not lose any ammunition and may be fired immediately. You must touch the gun in question to enact this rite, and may only perform the rite on one weapon per Round—any more would be disrespectful to the machine spirits.
### **The Flesh is Weak (Ascendant Talent)**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cyber Mantle/Potentia Coil)

You have undergone extensive bionic replacement to the point where your body is more machine than man, bringing you ever closer to holy singularity with the Omnissiah.

This Talent grants you the [Machine](traits.md#machine%20%28X%29) Trait with Armour Points equal to the number of times this Talent has been taken. You may purchase this Talent multiple times in accordance with your Career Advances. In this case, note the number of times this Talent has been taken, such as The Flesh is Weak 3.
### **Thrown Weapon Training**
**Talent Groups:** Primitive, Chain, Shock, Power

You have received basic training in a group of thrown weaponry, and can use such weapons without penalty.
### **Total Recall**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 30

Through long years of mental conditioning and practice, your mind is like a mechanised archive, able to record and recall great amounts of information. You can automatically remember any trivial fact or piece of information that you might feasibly have picked up in the past. When trying to recall more detailed or obscure facts, such as the precise layout of a crime scene or a page you read in an ancient grimoire five years ago, the GM may require you to make an Intelligence Test.
### **True Grit**
**Prerequisites:** Toughness 40

You are able to shrug off wounds that would fell lesser men. Whenever you suffer Critical Damage, halve the result (rounding up).
##### Example:
*Drake has the True Grit Talent and is shot for 12 points of Damage. He has a Toughness Bonus of 3, 2 Armour Points on the Hit Location, and 3 Wounds remaining. This means that after reduction for Toughness Bonus, Armour Points, and Wounds, the Critical Damage he takes (i.e. damage suffered once a character reaches 0 Wounds) is 4 (12-3+2+3=4). Because he has the True Grit talent this Damage is then halved—Drake therefore only takes 2 points of Critical Damage.*
### **Two-Weapon Wielder**
**Talent Groups:** Ballistic, Melee
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 35 or Weapon Skill 35, Agility 35

Your great expertise with arms allows you to use a weapon in each hand. When armed with two one-handed weapons (either melee or ranged weapons), you may make a [Multiple Attacks](combat.md#multiple%20attacks%20%28full%20action%29) Action to attack with both. Both Tests made to attack with the weapons [suffer a –20 penalty](combat.md#two-weapon%20fighting). You must possess both Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee) and Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic) if you wish to use a gun and melee weapon at the same time with this Talent.
### **Unarmed Master (Ascendant Talent)**
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 45, Agility 40, Unarmed Warrior

Your absolute mastery of [unarmed combat](combat.md#unarmed%20combat) techniques has rendered your bare hands more deadly than common blades. Your unarmed combat attacks do 1d10+SB Impact Damage and lose the Primitive quality.
### **Unarmed Warrior (Ascendant Talent)**
**Prerequisites:** Weapons Skill 35, Agility 35. 

Due to extensive training in hand-to-hand combat, your [unarmed attacks](combat.md#unarmed%20combat) now inflict 1d10–3 Impact Damage instead of the usual 1d5–3. You have trained fighting with your fists and feet against both armed and unarmed foes, and you do not count as Unarmed when making attacks against opponents with readied weapons. Your attacks still have the Primitive quality, however.

If you have the [Two-Weapon Wielder](talents.md#two-weapon%20wielder) Talent you may use it with your unarmed attacks as though you were armed with melee weapons (see above).
### **Unremarkable**

Something about your face and mannerisms just don’t stick in people’s memories. You can more easily blend into crowds or pass yourself off as a nobody. Any attempts to recall your face or spot you in a crowd suffer a –20 penalty. In addition, you gain a +20 bonus when using the [Deceive](skills.md#deceive) Skill to either convince someone he has never seen or met you before, or if you are trying to appear harmless and ordinary. Naturally, this Talent doesn’t work if you're wearing distinctive clothes or armour, or carry unique weaponry or tools.
### **Unshakeable Faith**

Your faith that the Emperor will preserve you is so strong that you are unafraid of stepping into danger. You may re-roll any failed Willpower Tests to avoid the effects of [Fear](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear). Additionally, you may choose to spend a Fate Point and become immune to Fear until the end of your next Turn.
### **Wall of Steel**
**Prerequisites:** Agility 35

Such is your skill with blades that they seem to impose themselves between you and harm. You may make an additional [Parry](combat.md#parry%20%28reaction%29) once per Round. In technical terms, this Talent gives you a second Reaction but which may only be used to Parry, thus allowing you to make two Parries in a single Round. Note that you may still only attempt a single Parry against any one attack.
### **Warp Conduit**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating, Favoured of the Warp, Willpower 40

The power of your mind and your faith in the Emperor means you have little to fear when you channel warp energy. When a Power Roll triggers [Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena), subtract 10 from any rolls on the **Table: Psychic Phenomena**.
### **Warp Sense**
**Prerequisites:** Psy Rating, Psyniscience Skill, Perception 30

Your senses have evolved to perceive the warp in parallel with the physical world, though it requires some concentration to do so. After gaining this Talent, using the [Psyniscience](skills.md#psyniscience) Skill requires a Half Action instead of a Full Action.
