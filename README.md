# How to participate for beginners:
## Set up for the first time:
### Step 1
Create a folder where you want to store all this data. (The computer will make a folder named Rule Books in that folder.)
### Step 2
In your terminal navigate to that folder that you created.
### Step 3
Enter this command.
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:zyzyx159/Rule-books.git
```
This tells the computer to go get a copy of all the files.
### Step 4
Enter this command
``` bash
git checkout -b <your name here>
```
This tells the computer to make a special place just for the changes you made so it won't mess up any of the edits anyone else has made.
### Step 5
Enter this command
``` bash
git push -u origin <your name here>
```
This tells the computer to make sure all of your changes are added to the server.
## Making changes
### Step 1
Open Obsidian and make changes to your hearts content.
### Step 2
In your terminal navigate to that folder that you created.
### Step 3 
Enter this command.
``` bash
git add .
```
Please note the period at the end of that statement, its important. To the computer that . means "all the files that have changes made to them" or "everything".
### Step 4
Enter this command
``` bash
git push
```
This command copies all the changes you made to the server
### Step 5
Let zyzyx159 know you have changes you would like added to the main rules book.
### Step 6
Wait for Zyzyx159 to do all the behind the git stuff that makes all this work so you don't have to :)
### Step 7
Profit? 
### Step 8
If you want to make more changes run step 4 & 5 from the "set up for the first time" section. You do *NOT* need to do any of the others.

	1) Pretty basic, but only 20 Minutes
2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE
	1) More comprehensive
	2) From the guy who taught me C#
3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH3zE7VlIMs
	1) At 4 hours I'm pretty sure this one earned the title "The full course"
	2) This guy is a full time, hard core developer. 
	3) I have not watched it, but I'm 99% sure its over the top.
