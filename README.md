# How to participate for beginners:
## Set up for the first time:
### Step 1
Create a folder where you want to store all this data. (The computer will make a folder named Rule Books in that folder.)
### Step 2
In your terminal navigate to that folder that you created.
### Step 3
Enter this command.
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:zyzyx159/Rule-books.git
```
This tells the computer to go get a copy of all the files.
### Step 4
Enter this command
``` bash
git checkout -b <your name here>
```
This tells the computer to make a special place just for the changes you made so it won't mess up any of the edits anyone else has made.
## Making changes
### Step 1
Open Obsidian and make changes to your hearts content.
### Step 2
In your terminal navigate to that folder that you created.
### Step 3 
Enter this command.
``` bash
git add .
```
Please note the period at the end of that statement, its important. To the computer that . means "all the files that have changes made to them" or "everything".
### Step 4
Enter this command
``` bash
git push
```
This command copies all the changes you made to the server
### Step 5
Let zyzyx159 know you have changes you would like added to the main rules book.
### Step 6
Wait for Zyzyx159 to do all the behind the git stuff that makes all this work so you don't have to :)
### Step 7
Profit? 
### Step 8
If you want to make more changes run step 4 from the "set up for the first time" section. You do *NOT* need to do any of the others.
