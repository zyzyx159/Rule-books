*"It is our destiny to rule the universe just as it is the destiny of the xeno to pave our way."*
— Lucretius VII, Inquisitor.

[Skills](skills.md) and [Talents](talents.md) represent ability and knowledge gained over the course of a character’s life. Traits, by contrast, are innate abilities gained by virtue of birth, racial circumstance, or radical physical changes. Some Traits may be gained through other means later in life, but they are often not gained through choice. You may acquire certain Traits as a result of your Origin, purchase them with Experience Points according to your career advance scheme, or even end up with one forced upon you by circumstances that occur during the game.

## **TRAIT DESCRIPTIONS**

### **Amphibious**
The creature can breathe water as well as air and can stay underwater indefinitely without the need to surface. If this Trait is taken by a creature with the ability to breathe a substance other than air (e.g. water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, etc) then it can breathe typical air as well as its native atmosphere.
### **Amorphous**
An amorphous creature has a malleable form, capable of squeezing its body or expanding it. It can change Size by one step in either direction, though doing so does not change its Speed. Creatures with this Trait determine their Movement rates using one-half their Agility Bonus (round up). Amorphous creatures are often missing common sensory organs such as eyes and ears; most have the Unnatural Senses Trait to perceive their surroundings.
### **Armour Plating (X)**
The creature is encased in external armour plating, gaining Armour Points equal to the number indicated in the parenthesis (X). These apply to all locations unless otherwise stated in the creature's description. Often found on combat servitors, Daemon engines, and other largely mechanical constructs, this Trait does not stack with worn Armour or those granted by the Natural Armour Trait, but does stack with the Machine Trait.
### **Auto-stabilised**
The creature always counts as [Braced](combat.md#brace%20heavy%20weapon%20%28half%20action%29) when firing Heavy-class weapons and may make [Semi-Auto Bursts](combat.md#semi-auto%20burst%20(full%20action)), [Full Auto Bursts](combat.md#full%20auto%20burst%20(full%20action)), and [Suppressing Fire](combat.md#suppressing%20fire%20(full%20action)) Actions as a Half Action.
### **Bestial**
A creature with this trait is animalistic, tending to behave instinctively rather than rationally. No matter how high its Intelligence score is, it still acts as an animal would. A creature with this Trait never needs to make a Survival Skill Test whilst in its natural habitat. Unless starving or desperate, a Bestial creature must make a Willpower Test when frightened, startled, or injured. On a failed Test, the creature flees from the apparent source of danger. 
### **Blind**
Blind creatures automatically fail all Tests based on vision and automatically fail all Ballistic Skill Tests. Such creatures take a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and most other Tests that ordinarily involve or are benefited by vision. Note that this Trait indicates not only that the creature cannot see but that it also has no other senses which would provide the same benefit as eyesight. A blind creature with the [Blind Fighting](talents.md#blind%20fighting) Talent reduces the penalties to Weapon Skill Tests from –30 to –15.
### **Brutal Charge (X)**
A creature with this Trait deals an extra Damage equal to the number indicated in the parenthesis (X) when it [Charges](combat.md#charge%20(full%20action)) in the same Round.
### **Burrower (X)**
A creature with this Trait can move through solid objects by burrowing through them. This Trait always includes a number to indicate speed. Such creatures can burrow through soil, loose rock, sand, and so on. Some creatures may be able to burrow through metal, rockcrete, solid rock, and other very hard surfaces—this will be noted in the creature's entry. When a creature burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel. Creatures of one size smaller than the creature that created the tunnel can enter these areas without impediment. There's a 50% chance each Round that the tunnel collapses behind the creature.
### **Crawler**
Worms, serpents, and similar creatures crawl and slither rather than walk. The Base Movement for a creature with this Trait is half their normal Movement rate (round up) as determined by their
Agility Bonus, but they do not take any penalties for moving over Difficult Terrain.
### **Daemonic**
Daemonic creatures are beings of the warp, but can manifest in realspace either through sheer strength of will, hunger, or occult rituals. Creatures with this Trait are hideously durable, doubling their Toughness Bonus against most Damage sources, and are also immune to poison and disease. The effects of this Trait stack with the effects of the Unnatural Characteristic Trait. This increase is negated by Damage inflicted by force weapons, Psychic Powers, holy attacks, or other creatures with this Trait. 

As they are composed of pure warp energy, creatures with the Daemonic Trait use Psychic Powers differently than mortals. A psychic daemon invokes [Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena) when it rolls "doubles"—i.e. the same number on two different dice—instead of with a result of 9, and adds +10 to the total when rolling on **Table: Psychic Phenomena**. Psychic daemons are not affected by the results of any Psychic Phenomena they cause, but may be harmed by [Perils of the Warp](psychic%20powers.md#perils%20of%20the%20warp).
#### **Daemonic Presence**
The mere existence of a daemon in reality is unsettling at best, causing all matters of strange phenomena and inexplicable events to occur around it. These effects extend to a specific radius around the daemon and will be detailed in the daemon's entry. All "true" daemons, from ebon geists to bloodthirsters, generally cause living creatures within this area to suffer a penalty to Willpower Tests due to the mind-bending horror of their existence in realspace.
### **Dark Sight**
A creature with this Trait sees normally even in areas of total darkness and never takes a penalty for fighting in areas of dim or no lighting.
### **Fear (X)**
A creature with this Trait has an unnerving appearance. Just how awful it is to behold is indicated by its **Fear Rating**, which is indicated by the number in parenthesis (X). The higher the Fear Rating
the harder it is for others to resist going insane or acting irrationally from the encounter.

When a character encounters a creature with this Trait, he must make a Willpower Test, modified by the severity of the creature's Trait. On a success, the character may be unsettled or disgusted but can still act normally. On a failure, the character must roll on **[Table: Shock](fear%20and%20damnation.md#shock%20and%20snapping%20out%20of%20it)** to determine how profoundly affected they are, adding +10 to the roll for every Degree of Failure by which the Willpower Test was failed.

| Fear Rating   | Willpower Test |
| ------------- | :------------: |
| 1—Disturbing  |       +0       |
| 2—Frightening |      -10       |
| 3—Horrifying  |      -20       |
| 4—Terrifying  |      -30       |

### **Flyer (X)**
A creature with this Trait has the natural ability to fly, whether with great feathered or leathery wings, strange warp energies, or inflatable gas sacs. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when flying. This number replaces the creature’s Agility Bonus for the purposes of calculating Movement. See [Flying](movement.md#flying) for more information.
### **From Beyond**
The mind of a creature with this Trait is beyond the petty frailties and precarious sanity of mortal intelligence. It is immune to Fear, Pinning, Insanity Points, and Psychic Powers used to cloud, control or delude its mind.
### **Hoverer (X)**
Creatures with this Trait have a limited capability for flight, flying no higher than two metres off the ground. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when hovering. This number replaces the creature's Agility Bonus for purposes of calculating Movement. See [Flying](movement.md#flying) for more information.
### **Incorporeal**
Incorporeal creatures are insubstantial and weightless, able to pass through solid objects such as walls and weapons. An incorporeal creature gains a +30 bonus on Concealment Tests due
to its ability to merge with and through objects. If it so wishes, it may become completely silent, automatically passing any Silent Move Tests that it is required to make.

An incorporeal creature is immune to normal weapons—common bullets and blades simply pass through its body as if it wasn't there. Daemons, Psychic Powers, warp creatures, other incorporeal entities, and opponents armed with force weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An incorporeal creature can't normally affect the mortal world, and thus can't damage non-incorporeal opponents unless it has a suitable special ability or Talent. Creatures with the Incorporeal Trait can Damage other creatures with the Incorporeal trait normally.

Certain devices can keep an incorporeal creature at bay, such as the Gellar Field of a spaceship, Void Shields, holy wards, or certain electromagnetic fields. Creatures with this Trait cannot pass through such a barrier.
### **Machine (X)**
A creature with the Machine Trait is fashioned mainly or entirely from inorganic materials and is generally more rigorous than fleshy folks. Machines do not breathe, are immune to the effects of a vacuum, extremes of cold, any mind-influencing Psychic Powers, and so forth. Machines can be quite durable and have a certain number of Armour Points (indicated by the number in parentheses) which, unless otherwise stated in the creature's entry, cover all locations. Unlike typical Armour, the Armour Points from this Trait apply towards Fire Damage. These Armour Points stack with those from worn Armour, but not with the Natural Armour Trait.
### **Multiple Arms (X)**
This creature has more than one pair of arms. The exact number of arms is indicated in parenthesis (X), so a mutant abomination with four arms would have the Multiple Arms (4) Trait. It gains a +10 bonus on [Acrobatics](skills.md#acrobatics), [Climb](skills.md#climb), and [Swim](skills.md#swim) Tests. In addition, for each pair of arms it has—the Multiple Arms Trait's value divided by 2—it may use the [Multiple Attacks](combat.md#multiple%20attacks%20%28full%20action%29) Action to make an additional attack as if wielding multiple melee weapons (naturally the creature must either have the Natural Weapons Trait or be holding actual melee weapons). If the creature possesses the [Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee)](talents.md#two-weapon%20wielder) Talent it may instead make an attack with each arm (i.e. one attack for each point of the Multiple Arms Trait) when using the Multiple Attacks Action.
### **Natural Armour (X)**
This creature has a naturally tough hide, bony plates covering its body, or a hard, chitinous exoskeleton, affording it some protection against attacks. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates how many Armour Points the creature gains—unless otherwise stated in the creature's entry, these apply to all locations. These Armour Points stacks with those from worn Armour, but not with those granted by the Machine Trait.
### **Natural Weapons**
This creature has sharp claws, teeth, spines, horns, or some other natural weapon with which it can rend, impale, or crush its prey. [It counts as being armed even when not wielding weapons](combat.md#unarmed%20combat). Its attacks deal 1d10 points of Damage plus its Strength Bonus. Depending on the type of natural weapon—hooves, talons, fangs, or even a body slam—this could be either Impact or Rending Damage. The creature may make attacks with its natural weapons using its Weapon Skill, which are considered to have the Primitive and Unbalanced qualities.

A creature with natural weapons cannot normally be disarmed, but a weapon with the Power Field quality may be able to destroy them—this is left to the GM's discretion based on the specific creature in question and how durable its natural weapons may be.
#### **Deadly Natural Weapons**
This creature is an especially dangerous specimen whose natural weapons are powerful enough to crush plasteel or bite into ceramite. Its attacks do not have the Primitive quality.
### **Phase**
A creature with this Trait can transform its body into an insubstantial state, passing ghost-like through solid objects or barriers of any sort. This Trait functions exactly like the Incorporeal Trait, except the creature may become solid or insubstantial by spending a Half Action. Whilst phased a creature with this Trait is subject to the same limitations regarding barriers and energy fields as if it had the Incorporeal Trait.
### **Possession**
Certain spirit-beings and denizens of the warp have the ability to possess mortal bodies. This is a far more insidious and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or even the power of the strongest psykers to "wear" the bodies of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is merged with the victim's living body on a fundamental level so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below, although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may vary. 

Note that Daemonhosts, being extraordinary powerful examples of deliberate, ritualistic possessions, designed to bind and control Daemons in living vessels, are a special case and dealt with separately.
#### **The Possession Attack**
The entity must be within a few metres of its intended victim and use a Full Action. The creature and target make Opposed Willpower Tests each Round until either the entity or the victim achieve a total of five degrees of success over the other—this is cumulative over several Rounds. If the entity wins, it successfully possesses its victim. If its victim wins, he has repelled the entity who may not attempt to possess him again for 24 hours. A repelled entity also takes 1d10 points of Damage which is not reduced by Armour or Toughness.
#### **The Effects of Possession**
A possessing entity takes control utterly, binding itself to its victim, and is capable of commanding the body to function regardless of pain and injury (and indeed might delight in damaging or altering it to suit its whims). The victim increases his Strength and Toughness Characteristics by 10 and gains 1d10+3 Wounds. The victim uses the possessing entity's Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship, and uses the entity's Psy Rating and Psychic Powers in place of its own (if any). Likewise, the possessed creature uses any mind-related Skills and Talents had by the entity and loses its own. 

The entity may also attempt to recall memories and skills from its victim with a successful Intelligence Test. In the case of possession by a Daemon, the victim has a good chance of becoming immediately mutated and likely to become further mutated the longer the possession continues.
#### **Surviving Possession**
Should the victim survive and the entity is cast out by exorcism or some other means, the ordeal deals 2d10 points of permanent Damage to the character’s Toughness and Willpower
Characteristics. In addition, the victim gains 1d10 Insanity Points.
### **Quadruped**
Across the galaxy there are many creatures, often animalistic ones, which amble around on two sets of legs. Such creatures are naturally much quicker over a distance than their bipedal counterparts. Quadrupeds calculate their Base Movement at twice their Agility Bonus, so a creature with the Quadruped Trait and an Agility of 34 would have a Base Movement of 6 (3×2).

Creatures with more than four legs will also generally have this Trait, increasing their Movement as indicated but adding 2 Metres to their Base Movement for each additional pair of legs beyond the first two pairs. If the example creature above was actually a hexaped (i.e. has six legs), its Base Movement would be 8 (3×2=6, +2=8).
### **Regeneration (X)**
Creatures with this Trait heal injuries with shocking speed. Each Round, at the start of its Turn, the creature Tests Toughness to remove an amount of Damage indicated in the parenthesis after the Trait. For most creatures this process is "automatic" and requires no Actions by the part of the creature. Unless otherwise stated in the creature's entry it loses this Trait when slain.
### **Size (X)**
Creatures come in one of ten different size categories, as shown on **Table: Size Modifiers** below. Size affects a creature's Movement rates, how well the creature can hide, and how easy or hard it is to strike that creature in combat. When calculating movement, apply the Size modifier first, and then other modifiers from other Traits or Talents. For the purposes of comparison, a human is a Size (Average) creature.

| **Size Category (Example)**                  | To Hit Modifier | Concealment | Base Movement |
| -------------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :---------: | :-----------: |
| Minuscule (Door handle, knife)               |       –30       |     +30     |     AB–3      |
| Puny (Servo-skull, vapour rat)               |       –20       |     +20     |     AB–2      |
| Scrawny (Ash slug, human child)              |       –10       |     +10     |     AB–1      |
| Average (Human adult, most bipedal xenos)    |       +0        |     +0      |     AB+0      |
| Hulking (Grox, Space Marine)                 |       +10       |     –10     |     AB+1      |
| Enormous (Ravener, silt spider)              |       +20       |     –20     |     AB+2      |
| Massive (Battle tank, scar wyrm)             |       +30       |     –30     |     AB+3      |
| Immense (Biotitan, macro hauler)             |       +40       |     –40     |     AB+4      |
| Gargantuan (Lesser battle titan, ore seeker) |       +50       |     –50     |     AB+5      |
| Colossal (Greater battle titan, Ordinatus)   |       +60       |     –60     |     AB+6      |

### **Sonar Sense**
A creature with this Trait perceives its surroundings by emitting a frequency noise, allowing the creature to locate the position of any solid object within 30 metres. Other creatures within this 30 metre range, and that succeed on a **Difficult (–10) Awareness Test**, may detect the curious keening.
### **Soul-bound**
The soul of this creature is bound to a higher purpose or being, in return for a measure of protection. When this Trait is first gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially Astropaths, are soul-bound to the God-Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos Sorcerers are often bound to one of the Ruinous Powers. 

A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional die when forced to roll [Perils of the Warp](psychic%20powers.md#perils%20of%20the%20warp), discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result (the psyker may choose to substitute this additional die roll for the result of either the ones die or the tens die rolled to determine Perils of the Warp). 

Upon becoming soul-bound, a character suffers one of the following effects, depending on who or what they are soul-bound to: 1d10 Insanity Points, the permanent loss of their sight, the permanent loss of 1d10 from one Characteristic, or a random mutation. In addition, a soul-bound character is permanently indebted to the entity in question, which undoubtedly entails all manner of other duties and consequences.
### **Stampede**
Whenever a creature with this Trait fails a Willpower Test, it automatically stampedes, charging in a straight line forwards as far as possible, overrunning anything in its path until the source of danger is escaped or crushed under hoof, taking Damage equal to the creature's Natural Weapon Damage (or 1d5+SB Impact Damage if it doesn't have one). One stampeding creature automatically causes all other creatures within sight to stampede. The stampede lasts until the source of danger is no longer visible or for 1d10 minutes, whichever occurs last.
### **Strange Physiology**
A creature with this Trait has unusual or bizarre anatomy that does not even somewhat correspond to [the normal Hit Locations](combat.md#the%20attack). Such creatures do not allocate Damage to individual locations and are slain when Damage equals or exceeds the creature's Wounds.
### **The Stuff of Nightmares**
Some warp entities are so hideously powerful that their will perpetuating their bodies in our reality is almost impossible to break or disrupt. Such entities are completely immune to the effects of poisons, diseases, the need to breathe, most environmental hazards, Blood Loss, Stunning, and any Critical Effect other than one that would destroy them outright, unless caused by a Psychic Power, force weapon or holy attack.
### **Sturdy**
Sturdy creatures are sure-footed and hard to move against their will, gaining a +20 bonus to Tests made to resist [Grappling](combat.md#grappling) and uses of the [Takedown Talent](talents.md#takedown).
### **Swarm**
Too small to do much on their own, swarms overwhelm their opponents via sheer weight of numbers. A swarm is often a great mass of Minuscule or Puny creatures, but could be composed of a truly enormous number of even more infinitesimal creatures. Any attack from a weapon that does not either have the Blast, Flame, or Scatter Qualities only inflicts half Damage against a swarm. In most circumstances, a swarm creature cannot be [Grappled](combat.md#grapple%20%28full%20action%29), [Knocked Down](combat.md#knock-down%20%28half%20action%29), or [Pinned](combat.md#pinning), and the swarm may “pour” through suitable small openings such as ducts, vents, and the like, but they may not Jump. The swarm is counted as being destroyed once it takes Damage in excess of its Wounds, after which any survivors will typically scatter. The swarm’s attacks have a variable Penetration value (roll each time an attack lands), representing its ability to engulf their victims and attack vulnerable areas.
### **Toxic (X)**
A creature with this Trait is poisonous, and may be venomous as well. Anyone that successfully deals Damage to a Toxic creature must make a Toughness Test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parenthesis (X) or suffer 1d10 points of Damage (of the same type as the weapon which inflicted the hit) that is not reduced by Armour or Toughness. For example, a creature with the Toxic (4) Trait would impose a –40 penalty on Toughness Tests. Some creatures may carry additional effects with their toxins, inflict more Damage, or have the Toxic special quality on their natural weapons—these variations, if any, will be indicated on the creature's entry.
### **Undying**
This creature has such an extremely durable anatomy, or is so suffused with warp energy, that it can withstand all matters of hazards and threats that would cripple or kill lesser beings. It is immune to diseases, poisons, and toxic effects, does not need to breathe, and can survive unaided even in a vacuum.
### **Unnatural Characteristic (X)**
One or more of the creature’s Characteristics is unnaturally strong compared to most. This is indicated by the number in parentheses, which is then added directly to the creature’s Characteristic Bonus. For example, a creature with a Strength of 41 normally has a Strength Bonus of 4. If the creature had Unnatural Strength (4) then its Strength Bonus is considered to be 8 (4+4). A creature may have this Trait more than once. Each time, it is applied to a new Characteristic. 

In addition, whenever a creature with an Unnatural Characteristic succeeds on a Test utilising that Characteristic, they gain a number of bonus degrees of success equal to half of their Unnatural Characteristic (round down). The example creature mentioned previously has Unnatural Strength (4) and would therefore gain 2 additional degrees of success on any successful Test utilising their Strength Characteristic.

Applying this Trait to a creature's Agility does not increase the creature's Movement—that is still based on the creature's unmodified Agility Bonus (but see the Unnatural Speed Trait below).
### **Unnatural Senses (X)**
The creature can perceive its surroundings using senses other than sight or hearing, using special organs, fine hairs or some other disquieting quality to make itself aware of what's around it. This Trait always includes a range in metres indicated by the number in parenthesis (X), and may contain other specific constraints or variations depending on the creature in question.
### **Unnatural Speed (X)**
The creature moves with great speed compared to other beings of its type. The creature adds the number in parenthesis (X) to its Agility Bonus for the purposes of determining its Movement rates. This increase stacks with those granted by a creature's Size and other factors. 
### **Warp Instability**
Most warp entities have a tenuous hold on our reality, often maintained only by horror and bloodshed, and may be disrupted if sufficient harm can be done to their manifested forms. If a creature with this Trait takes Damage and does not inflict Damage or Insanity Points on other creatures by the end of its next Turn, it must make a Willpower Test. The creature takes 1d5 Damage if it fails, plus 1 Damage for each degree of failure. Damage inflicted by Warp Instability is absolute—it cannot be prevented by any means, including Armour or Toughness. If this would inflict Damage equal to or in excess of the creature's Wounds, it is cast back into the warp.
### **Warp Weapon**
Creatures with this Trait have weapons that are partially insubstantial, able to ignore such mundane things as Armour or [Cover](combat.md#cover). Natural weapons and attacks made by a creature with this Trait ignore physical Armour unless it is created from psychoactive materials or is warded against the warp's malignant energies (holy armour, for example). Force fields still work against these attacks normally.
