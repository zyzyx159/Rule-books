*"Strike fast and suddenly. Attack without warning. Secure victory before the foe is aware of his danger. Remember always, a war is easily won if your enemy does not know he is fighting."* — *Tactica Imperialis*.

Make no mistake: the Imperium is a dangerous place. Over the course of their investigations, explorations and travels, the characters are bound to encounter those who would see them dead. Unless the characters plan to spend their lives running away from their enemies, they will have to make a stand and fight. As a result, combat can form a key component in your Dark Heresy game. 

**Being familiar with the ins and outs of battle can only improve your chances of survival.**
# **ROUNDS, TURNS & TIME**

For most occasions whilst playing ***Dark Heresy***, the GM simply describes the scene or situation and asks the players how they react. Time is flexible, and is subject to the GM's decision based on the choices the characters make. Whilst the GM should have an idea about how much time approximately passes, it's not necessary to track the passage of time down to the exact second, or even the minute or hour. It is enough to say that "it takes about an hour to reach the spectral vestibule" or "after about fifteen minutes of walking, you come upon a crashed Aquila Lander". This sort of approach is known as "game time" or "Narrative Time".

In contrast to the loose laws of Narrative Time, there are many situations when every second counts and the GM must closely monitor what is going on. It might be that the GM needs to adjudicate a furious sword fight, or to track the characters' pace as they pursue fleeing cultists through the alleys of Gunmetal City. This is considered "Structured Time" or "Rounds".

When playing in such detailed moments of time, the GM must slice the action up into Rounds and Turns. A Round is approximately five seconds of Action. During a Round, participants in the encounter each have a Turn to act. Each character's Turn overlaps slightly, so Actions are almost simultaneous within the Round. Combat is the most common time that players will encounter detailed time or "Combat Time", but is by no means the only circumstance where Rounds and Turns are used. See **Movement** for more details.
# **COMBAT OVERVIEW**

Each character, including NPCs, takes a Turn within the Round. It is therefore necessary to determine the order in which Actions are taken. When combat begins, follow these steps to determine what happens.
### **Step One: Surprise**

When beginning a combat, the GM determines if any of the combatants are Surprised. This only affects the first Round and isn't always necessary even then. Surprised combatants lose their Turn on the first Round of combat. They are caught unawares and their opponents get a full Round's "drop" on them. If no one is Surprised, then move immediately onto Step Two.
### **Step Two: Roll Initiative**

At the start of the first Round, each combatant must roll for Initiative. Each combatant rolls 1d10 and adds his Agility Bonus (the tens digit of his Agility characteristic). The result of the roll applies for all successive Rounds in the combat.
### **Step Three: Determine Initiative Order**

The GM ranks all the Initiative rolls, including those of the NPCs and creatures, from highest to lowest. This is the order that characters will act in during each Round of combat.
### **Step Four: Characters Take Turns**

Starting with the participant with the highest Initiative roll, each character takes a Turn. During his Turn, a character can perform one or more Actions. Once a character has finished his Actions, the next participant takes a Turn and so on.
### **Step Five: Round Ends**

Once each participant has taken a Turn, the Round is over.
### **Step Six: Repeat Steps Four and Five as Needed**

Continue to play successive Rounds until the combat is complete or until you finished whatever it is that triggered the switch from Narrative Time to Combat Time.
# **SURPRISE**

Surprise only affects the first Round of combat. It is up to the GM to decide if any of the combatants are Surprised. Ultimately, this comes down to a judgement call on the GM's part, based on the circumstances and the Actions of the various combatants leading up to the encounter. The GM should take the following into account when determining Surprise:

- Is anyone hiding? Successful use of the Concealment skill before the combat may mean that some combatants are hidden. Extremely wary characters may oppose this with a Perception Test.
- Is anyone sneaky? Successful use of the Silent Move skill may have positioned some characters for an ambush. Again, wary opponents may oppose this with a Perception Test.
- Are there any unusual circumstances that would mask the approach of attackers? This can cover nearly anything, from pouring rain to whining engines to nearby explosions.
- Are there any distractions? It's possible that something quite distracting is going on. A cultist's attention may be so fixated on the sermon of his confessor that he doesn't notice his attackers approaching.

Bearing all of this in mind, the GM must decide which combatants are Surprised. Whilst it's often the case that one entire side or the other is Surprised, there can be individual exceptions. For example, mutants may easily Surprise a unit of green Guardsmen, but not their keen-eyed commissar.

If no one is Surprised, proceed with the combat as normal. Surprised characters lose their Turn in the first Round. They can do nothing except stand dumbfounded whilst their opponents fall upon them, with the attackers gaining +30 to hit during the first Round of combat only. After the first Round, Surprised characters recover their wits and can act normally.
##### Example:
*Having dealt with one group of cultists, Mordechai and Drake continue on their mission only to fall foul of an ambush by more members of the Barbed Chalice. The combat begins when the cultists attempt to shoot their autoguns at the Acolytes from concealed positions. The GM decides that Mordechai and Drake are Surprised. The cultists aim and shoot at the unlucky Acolytes. Since they are Surprised, Mordechai and Drake do not get a chance to act. Once the cultists have taken their shots, the Surprise Round ends. The GM starts at the top of the Initiative order for Round two and the combat proceeds as normal.*
# **INITIATIVE**

Initiative determines the order in which participants act during each Round. To determine Initiative, roll 1d10 and add the result to the character's Agility Bonus. Naturally the GM rolls the Initiative of any NPCs and creatures present.

GMs can make one Initiative roll for each group of like characters. For example, if there are three gangers in the combat, all of which have the same Characteristics, it isn’t necessary to roll Initiative separately for each ganger. One roll will do for all of them and they’ll act at the same time in the Initiative order.
##### Example:
*Mordechai, an Arbitrator with AB of 3 (the tens digit from his Agility of 35), rolls for Initiative when his group is attacked by three cultists of the Barbed Chalice. He rolls a 6 on a d10, so his Initiative for this combat is 9 (6+3). His companion, Drake, gets an 8 and the cultists 7. So, Mordechai goes first, followed by Drake, and then by the cultists.*

Once everyone has rolled, the GM makes a list and places each character or creature in order, from highest to lowest. This is the order the combatants act in each Round, until the combat is over.

If more than one character has the same Initiative, they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they also have the same Agility then each should roll a die, with the highest going first.

Most combats last for multiple Rounds. You only need to determine Initiative at the start of the fight, however. Once the Initiative order has been established, it remains the same from Round to Round. If new combatants join in the midst of the encounter, simply roll Initiative for them and add them to the order.
##### Example:
*The combat has been raging for three Rounds now and one of the cultists has been slain. Alerted by the noise ,a corrupt enforcer arrives to aid the cultists, so the GM rolls Initiative and gets a 7. The enforcer has 25 Agility (giving him an AB of 2), so he goes after Mordechai (Initiative roll of 7 plus Agility Bonus of 2=Initiative of 9). In the new Round, the revised Initiative order is Mordechai (9), enforcer (9), Drake (8), and finally the two remaining cultists (7).*
# **ACTIONS**

During each normal Round, every character gets a Turn to act. On his Turn, a character can take one or more Actions. There are five types of Actions in ***Dark Heresy***.
### **Full Action**

A Full Action requires a character's complete attention to accomplish on his Turn. A character that takes a Full Action cannot take any Half Actions this Round.
### **Half Action**

A Half Action is fairly simple, like moving or drawing a weapon. A character can take two different Half Actions on his Turn instead of taking a Full Action.

**Note that you may not take the same Half Action twice in a single Round.**
### **Reactions**

A Reaction is an Action that is made in response to some event, such as an attack. All characters receive one Reaction each Round, which normally may only be used when it is not their Turn. Examples include making a Dodge Test or Parrying an attack.
### **Free Action**

A Free Action takes but a split second and so can be taken in addition to any other Actions you make in a Round. There is no formal limit to the number of Free Actions a character can make in a Round, but a GM should use common sense to set reasonable limits on what can be done in a few seconds.
### **Extended Actions**

Some Actions take more time than a single Round to complete. Once you commit yourself to an Extended Action, you are considered to be working towards completing that Action for as long as it takes. Should you be interrupted or if you abandon the Extended Action, all progress towards completing it is lost.
## **Using Actions**

Typical Actions include drawing a weapon, attacking, and moving. During his Turn, a character may perform one Full Action or two different Half Actions. A character could, for example, make a charge attack (Full Action) or aim and shoot (two Half Actions). It's important to remember that a Round is only a few seconds long, so the character's Turn within that Round is but a few moments.

Any Action can be combined with talking, banter, battle cries and other short verbal expressions—these are considered Free Actions. It is left to the GM to decide what a player might be able to say in the time—obviously a terse warning or a wry aside to a comrade would be acceptable. Reciting the complete one-hundred and seventeen rules for the denunciation and chastisement of traitors to the Imperium would not be.
##### Example:
*Vos has rolled an Initiative of 11 this Round. When his Turn comes, he must decide what to do. As he has finally found the Grox he has been tracking, he decides to move up to the beast and then hack at it with his chain axe. Moving and attacking are both Half Actions, so Vos can't do anything more this Round. Once his Actions are resolved, the next combatant in Initiative order (in this case, the rather annoyed Grox, with an Initiative of 10) takes its Turn.*

Most Actions must be completed during your Turn. You can't start a charge attack in one Round and finish it on the next. Some Actions, however, take longer than a single Round to complete. These are known as Extended Actions and they are noted in the following descriptions.

A character attempting an Extended Action must continue with that Action until it's finished. He can't start to reload a musket, move and then finish reloading, for example. A character may abort the Action part-way through, but this means that all the time spent on it thus far is wasted.
##### Example:
*Hybris, a Tech-Priest, needs to reload his heavy stubber, which takes two Full Actions. He starts on his next Turn, taking one Full Action. On his following Turn, he finishes reloading by spending another Full Action. If he had chosen to abandon his reloading efforts after the first Round, the Extended Action would have been aborted and he'd have to start the process all over again later, if he still wanted to reload.*
#### **A Note on Combat Abstractions**

Combat in ***Dark Heresy*** is fast and furious, designed so game sessions don't become bogged down with minutia. As such, the rules take certain licences with reality and assumptions must be made about what is really going on during a combat. Generally speaking, when two characters are engaged, they are exchanging attacks, feints, sidesteps, and a number of other manoeuvres, all of which are rolled into the Standard Attack. Therefore, a Test against Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill assumes that the defender is attempting to defend himself to some degree—hence a typical Attack Test is **Challenging (+0)**. A failed Test means that the defender was too difficult to hit or some other circumstance intervened on their behalf, whilst a successful Test means that the attacker was able to strike a possibly telling blow. The Dodge and Parry Actions represent your last line of defence against an attacker, giving you one more chance to avoid a bullet or the swing of a chainsword.
#### **Other Actions?**
If a player wants to do something not covered by the Actions described here, the GM should make a judgement about how long something might take and what type of Action it would be. Generally, most Actions should be resolved with some sort of Test: Characteristic Test, Skill Test or Opposed Test. Keep in mind that a Round is only a few seconds long, which is a very limited amount of time to accomplish a task.

## **Action Descriptions**

These Actions provide players with a variety of manoeuvres, giving their characters a range of options in combat. Actions are divided up into Attack Actions, Movement Actions and Miscellaneous Actions.
### **Attack Actions**

Attack Actions are any Action that involves attacking and damaging your opponents.
#### **All Out Attack (Full Action)**

You make a furious melee attack, exposing yourself to danger in order to land a forceful blow. You gain a +20 bonus on your Weapon Skill Test, but you may not Parry or Dodge until your next Turn.
#### **Called Shot (Full Action)**

You attempt to target a specific or vulnerable area on your target. Declare a location on your target (e.g., Head, Body, Left Arm, Right Arm, Left Leg, or Right Leg) and makes a **Hard (-20) Weapon Skill Test** or a **Hard (-20) Ballistic Skill Test**. If you succeed, skip the Determine Hit Location step of the attack and instead hit the desired location.
#### **Charge (Full Action)**

You rush up to an opponent and deliver a single melee attack. The opponent must be at least 4 metres away from you, but within your Charge Move distance. The last 4 metres of the Charge must be in a straight line, so you can build up speed and line up with your opponent. You gain a +10 bonus to your Weapon Skill Test made at the end of the Charge.

Note that Charge must be used to make a melee attack at the end of your movement. You need not be aware of a specific opponent when starting a Charge Action, such as rounding a corner or running up stairs, as long as there is a valid opponent to attack at the end of your movement.

Instead of striking with a weapon, you may attempt a Knock-Down against an opponent at the end of your Charge. Alternatively, if you are unarmed, you may choose to start a Grapple instead.
#### **Defensive Stance (Full Action)**

You strike no blows this Round as you concentrate entirely on defending yourself. Until your next Turn, you can make one additional Reaction, and all opponents suffer a -20 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack you.
#### **Feint (Half Action)**

You use guile and misdirection to deceive your opponent in the hopes of getting him to make a deadly mistake. You and your opponent make an **Opposed Weapon Skill Test**. If you win, your next attack cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a Standard Attack, you lose this advantage.
#### **Full Auto Burst (Full Action)**

You mash the trigger and let off a barrage of gunfire at your enemies. You must be using a weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this Action.

Your withering hail of fire grants a +20 modifier to your Ballistic Skill Test. Note that a dice result of 94 to 00 on your Ballistic Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed. If the ranged attack is successful, a hit is scored as normal. Furthermore, every degree of success scores an extra hit, up to a maximum number of hits equal to the fully automatic rate of fire for your weapon. Your extra hits can be either allocated to the original target, or any other target within 2 metres (provided that the new target would not have been harder to hit). If you choose to allocate your hits against another target that target is entitled to a Dodge Test as if he were the original target of the attack.

When you use this Action with a Pistol- or Basic-class weapon you may also move up to your Agility bonus in meters. However, if you do so you gain no bonus to your Ballistic Skill Test and instead suffer a -10 penalty. 

If you have a pistol in each hand that are both capable of fully automatic fire you may fire both with this Action.

If the weapon has the Scatter quality and is fired with a Full Auto Burst at Point Blank Range, any extra hits from Scatter and Full Auto Burst are calculated separately and both applied.

See **Table: Multiple Hits** below to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Remember, the first hit is always determined by reversing the numbers of the dice result made to perform the Test.
##### Example
*Quint fires a Full Auto Burst with a rare xeno artefact weapon at a rogue psyker who is at Point Blank Range. The xeno artefact weapon has a Full Auto Rate of Fire of 6 and has the Scatter special quality. Quint’s Ballistic Skill is 38, +20 for firing a Full-Auto Burst, +30 for being at Point Blank Range, and –20 because he does not have training with the exotic xeno weapon, for a modified total of 68. Quint rolls a 37 on his Ballistic Skill Test and succeeds with three degrees of success (58, 48, 38). He scores one hit on the rogue psyker because he succeeded and three extra hits thanks his three degrees of success. Furthermore, the Scatter special quality grants an extra hit for every two degrees of success when the weapon is fired at Point Blank Range, which means Quint scores another extra hit for a grand total of five hits. It looks like the rogue psyker is about to become part of the scenery!*
##### **Table: Multiple Hits**

| **Location**         | **Second** | **Third** | **Fourth** | **Fifth** | **Each Additional Hit** |
| -------------------- | :--------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| Head                 |    Head    |    Arm    |    Body    |    Arm    |          Body           |
| Arm                  |    Arm     |   Body    |    Head    |   Body    |           Arm           |
| Body                 |    Body    |    Arm    |    Head    |    Arm    |          Body           |
| Leg                  |    Leg     |   Body    |    Arm     |   Head    |          Body           |

#### **Grapple (Full Action)**

This Action is only used when you are engaged in a Grapple. Starting a Grapple is described in the section on Unarmed Combat below.

If you are controlling the Grapple, you may maintain it by using the Grapple Action; otherwise, the Grapple immediately ends and you (and your opponent!) are free to act normally again. If you have chosen to maintain the Grapple, you can choose one of the following Controller Grapple Options:
##### **Controller Grapple Options**

* **Damage Opponent:** You damage your opponent through brute force, pummelling your body into his or smashing him against a nearby object. Make an Opposed Strength Test with your opponent. If you win, you inflict unarmed Damage (for most characters: 1d5-3+SB, Primitive) to the opponent's Body location and one level of Fatigue (even if the opponent reduces the Damage you have inflicted to 0). If the opponent wins the Opposed Strength Test, he takes no Damage or Fatigue, but he is still Grappled. This action can benefit from Assistance, and there are certain Talents and Traits that may modify these values.
* **Throw Down Opponent:** You may wrestle your Grappled opponent to the ground by making an Opposed Strength Test. This test can benefit from Assistance. If you win, your opponent becomes prone. You may choose to end the Grapple at this point, leaving your opponent vulnerable at your feet.
* **Push Opponent:** You can attempt to force your Grappled opponent to move. This is resolved with an Opposed Strength Test, which can benefit from Assistance. If you succeed, you push your opponent one metre in a direction of your choice; success by one or more degrees allows you to push your opponent an equal number of metres further, but the total distance cannot exceed your Half Move distance. You must move with your Grappled opponent in order to maintain the Grapple, or you can choose to let go of the opponent, effectively shoving him away. This ends the Grapple but allows you to maintain your ground.
* **Ready:** You can ready one of your own items, or if the GM allows, you can use the Ready Action to grab an accessible item belonging to your Grappled opponent.
* **Stand:** If you and your opponent are on the ground, you can regain your feet with this action. You can also attempt to drag your Grappled opponent up with you by making an Opposed Strength Test. This test can benefit from Assistance. If you win, both you and your opponent stand.
* **Use Item:** You can use a readied item.
##### **Grappled Target Options**
If you are the target of a Grapple (your opponent is in control), you must declare Grapple as a Half Action—this is a significantly detrimental aspect of being Grappled. Remember that you cannot declare the same action twice in one Round. Once declared, you can choose one of the following Grappled Target Options:

* **Break Free:** You can attempt to break free of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength Test with your opponent. This test can benefit from Assistance. If you win, you break free and may perform any Half Action available to you.
* **Slip Free:** You can attempt to wriggle out of the Grapple by making a **Challenging (+0) Contortionist Skill Test.** If you succeed, you slip free and may perform any Half Action that is normally available to you.
* **Take Control:** You overpower your opponent and take control of the Grapple! Make an Opposed Strength Test with your opponent. This test can benefit from Assistance. If you win, you become the controller of the Grapple and your opponent becomes the Grappled target. You may immediately perform one of the Controller Grapple Options, but cannot take any other Half Actions.
##### Example
*Brutis is Grappling a mercenary named Eli atop an elevated platform. It is Brutis’ Turn in the Initiative Order, and since he is in control of the Grapple, he decides to attempt to push Eli toward the edge of the platform. The GM calls for an Opposed Strength Test. Brutis has a Strength of 40 and rolls a 34—a success. Eli has a Strength of 37 and rolls a 68—a failure. Brutis wins the Opposed Test and pushes Eli one metre toward the edge of the platform. Brutis also moves with Eli because he wants to maintain control of the Grapple.*

*On Eli’s Turn, he decides to attempt to take control of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength Test with Brutis. Eli rolls a 22 and gets one degree of success, and Brutis rolls a 39 and gets a success. Eli wins the Opposed Test because he counted more degrees of success than Brutis. Eli is now in control of the Grapple and will have more options on his next Turn.*
##### **Size Differences in a Grapple**
If one participating Grappler is larger than the other in terms of size, the larger Grappler gains a +10 bonus on all Grapple Tests, as well as one extra degree of success per size category difference on all successful Opposed Tests performed within the Grapple.
##### Example
*Titus is being Grappled by an Ork freebooter. Both combatants have Strengths of 40, but the Ork’s size is Hulking, which is one size category larger than Titus' Average size. On his Turn, Titus attempts to break free of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength Test. Titus rolls a 26 and gets one degree of success. The Ork rolls a 32, and with a +10 bonus for his greater Size, also gets one degree of success, plus another for his size difference, for a total of two degrees of success, which is enough to win the Opposed Test. Titus remains held fast by the brawny xeno filth.*
#### **Guarded Attack (Full Action)**

You perform a careful attack, making sure to withhold some power to remain poised for self-defence. You suffer a –10 penalty on all Weapon Skill Tests until the start of your next Turn, but you also gain a +10 bonus on Dodge or Parry Tests for same.
#### **Knock-Down (Half Action)**

You smash your opponent with raw physical force in the hopes of knocking him from his feet. You and your opponent make **Opposed Strength Tests**. If you spend at least a Half Action to move towards your opponent first, or if you make this Action as part of a Charge, you gain a +10 bonus to this Test.

If you succeed, you overpower your opponent and knock him prone—he must use the Stand Action on his Turn to get back to his feet. If you succeed by two or more degrees of success your opponent also suffers your Unarmed Damage (usually 1d5-3+SB with the Primitive quality) and gains one level of Fatigue. 

If your opponent wins, he keeps his footing. If your opponent wins by two or more degrees of success he uses your momentum against you and you are Knocked-Down instead. 
#### **Multiple Attacks (Full Action)**

This Action is used to make more than one attack on your Turn. Ordinarily, you must have another Talent that grants you additional attacks to use this Action, such as Swift Attack or Lightning Attack, or Two-Weapon Wielder. Alternatively, if you happen to have the Multiple Arms Trait, your greater-than-typical number of limbs grant you access to this Action as well.
#### **Overwatch (Full Action, Varies)**

You guard a particular area, poised to hurl a volley of fire at any opponent foolish enough to intrude. You must be armed with a weapon capable of using Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst to declare an Overwatch. When you declare Overwatch you specify a kill zone, such as a corridor or tree line, within a 45 degree arc from where you are currently facing. Setting up your kill zone is a Full Action.

Once your kill zone is defined, determine whether you wish to reserve a Semi-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst, or Suppressing Fire Action (assuming your weapon is capable of said modes of attack), and under what conditions you will attack—for example, if any mutants appear in the corridor, or if a certain person you are gunning for walks across the plaza.

Any time the specified conditions are met before the start of your next Turn you may immediately attack with your previously declared reserved Action. If your attack occurs at the same time as another character's action the character with the higher Agility Bonus goes first. If both characters have the same Agility Bonus, make an **Opposed Agility Test** to determine who goes first.

When using Semi-Auto Burst any target you attack with your Overwatch must make a **Pinning Test** or become Pinned. If using Full Auto Burst or Suppressing Fire, the Pinning Test becomes **Hard (–20)**. If you score additional hits due to degrees of success you may allocate those between different targets within your kill zone as normal for your attack Action.

You may continue Overwatch for up to your Willpower Bonus in hours, during which time you may not take any other Half or Full Actions or Reactions, though you may still make Free Actions, such as speech. After this time you must rest and refresh yourself for 1d10×10 minutes before you can focus enough to declare another Overwatch. 

Once you have used your reserved attack Action, Overwatch ends. You may declare another Overwatch on your next Turn if you wish to continue warding the area. If you so desire you may opt to end Overwatch during your Turn, even if you have not used your reserved Action.
#### **Semi-Auto Burst (Full Action)**

With cold precision you squeeze out a burst of semi-automatic gunfire. You must be using a weapon capable of semi-automatic fire to take this Action.

Make a Ballistic Skill Test, your increased volume of fire granting you a +10 bonus. Note that a dice result of 94 to 00 on your Ballistic Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed. If the ranged attack is successful, a hit is scored as normal. Furthermore, every two degrees of success scores an extra hit. The number of extra hits you can score in this manner may not exceed the semi-automatic rate of fire for your weapon. Your extra hits can be either allocated to the original target, or any other target within 2 metres (provided that the new target would not have been harder to hit). If you choose to allocate your hits against another target that target is entitled to a Dodge Test as if he were the original target of the attack.

When you use this Action with a Pistol- or Basic-class weapon you may also move up to your Agility bonus in meters. However, if you do so you gain no bonus to your Ballistic Skill Test.

If you have a pistol in each hand that are both capable of semi-automatic fire you may fire both with this Action.

If the weapon has the Scatter quality and is fired with a Semi-Auto Burst at Point Blank Range, any extra hits from Scatter and Semi-Auto Burst are calculated separately and both applied.

See **Table: Multiple Hits** below to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Remember, the first hit is always determined by reversing the numbers of the dice result made to perform the Test.
##### Example
*Jericus fires a Semi-Auto Burst with his lasgun at a mutant. The lasgun has* *a semi-auto Rate of Fire of 3, so regardless of what else happens, Jericus* *expends three shots from his charge pack. Jericus’ Ballistic Skill is 42 +10* *for firing a Semi-Auto Burst for a modified total of 52. He rolls a 23 on* *his Ballistic Skill Test and succeeds with two degrees of success (52, 42,* *32). Jericus scores one hit because he succeeded and one extra hit because* *of his two degrees of success. The first hit strikes the mutant’s left arm,* *which is determined by reversing his Ballistic Skill Test roll (52 becomes* *25). **Table: Multiple Hits** is then consulted which indicates that* *the second hit also strikes the mutant’s arm. Jericus would then make two* *damage rolls, one for each hit.*
##### **Table: Multiple Hits**

| **Location**         | **Second** | **Third** | **Fourth** | **Fifth** | **Each Additional Hit** |
| -------------------- | :--------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| Head                 |    Head    |    Arm    |    Body    |    Arm    |          Body           |
| Arm                  |    Arm     |   Body    |    Head    |   Body    |           Arm           |
| Body                 |    Body    |    Arm    |    Head    |    Arm    |          Body           |
| Leg                  |    Leg     |   Body    |    Arm     |   Head    |          Body           |

#### **Standard Attack (Half Action)**

You can make one melee attack by testing Weapon Skill or a ranged attack by testing Ballistic Skill. 

If you are unarmed you can attempt to Grapple your opponent instead of inflicting Damage—see Unarmed Combat below for more details.

Remember, you may not take the same Half Action twice in a single Round, so even if you take no other Actions you cannot make two Standard Attacks.
#### **Stun (Full Action)**

When unarmed, or armed with a melee weapon, you can strike to incapacitate rather than attempt to land a potentially deadly blow. Make a **Hard (–20) Weapon Skill Test** as if you were resolving a Standard Attack. If the attack succeeds, roll 1d10 and add your Strength Bonus. Your opponent rolls 1d10 and adds his Toughness Bonus +1 per Armour Point protecting his head (remember that if the attack is Primitive, such as most unarmed attacks, the Armour Points are doubled). If your roll is equal to or higher than your opponent's he is Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to the difference between the rolls and gains one level of Fatigue.
#### **Suppressing Fire (Full Action)**

You unleash a hail of firepower intending to force your opponents into cover. You must be using a weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this Action.

Pick an area to suppress. The size of this area, known as your kill zone, extends 45 degrees out from the direction you are facing and up to half the range of the weapon. It is often easier to say you are covering a specific area such as a corridor, doorway, or section of treeline. If there is any doubt, the GM has final say on whether a target is within your kill zone or not.

Make a **Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill Test**, expending ammunition as if you had made a Full-Auto Burst. A dice result of 94 to 100 on the test indicates the weapon has Jammed. Assuming your weapon has not Jammed, all targets caught within your kill zone—even if they have not been hit—must make a **Pinning Test** or become Pinned. If you are attacking with a heavy weapon, such as a heavy stubber or multi-laser, this becomes a **Hard (–20)** Test.

If your Ballistic Skill Test is successful, the GM assigns the hit to a random target within the kill zone. Note that if any allies or bystanders happen to be caught within the kill zone they may be struck by your gunfire! For every two degrees of success you score an extra hit against another random victim. Use of the Suppressing Fire Action does not affect the defensive benefits of armour or cover. The number of hits scored may not exceed the fully automatic rate of fire for your weapon. 
### **Move Actions**

Move Actions let you reposition and reorient yourself on the battlefield.
#### **Disengage (Full Action)**

You carefully break off from melee combat and may move up to your Half Move rate. Opponents whom you were engaged with do not gain the customary free attack against you. See **Fleeing** below for more details.
##### **Fleeing**
Sometimes discretion is truly the better part of valour, and you may find your best course of action is to get away from danger. In combat, you may voluntarily flee from an opponent, or you may be forced to flee because of Fear, a Psychic Power, or some other effect. When fleeing under your own control, you may Disengage, Move, or Run. When fleeing against your will, you must take the Run Action. 

Normally, fleeing from melee combat means you're turning your back on your opponent and leaving yourself open for an attack, which most are happy to oblige. Each opponent with whom you Move or Run away from gets a free Standard Attack against you. This extra attack is made in addition to any other attacks they make during their Turn. If you use the Disengage Action this represents a more "planned" withdrawal from the melee, and your opponents consequently are not able to make the customary free attack against you.
#### **Jump/Leap (Full Action)**

You can Jump vertically or Leap horizontally. If you are engaged in melee at the time the usual concessions for Fleeing apply, and your opponents may be entitled to a free attack against you.

For ease of reference, rules governing Jumping and Leaping are duplicated here:
##### Standing Vertical Jumps
From a standing position, an average character can jump about half a metre straight up (measured from the ground to the bottom of his feet). Jumping distance depends as much on a character’s body mass as it does his Strength and Agility, so this distance tends to vary only slightly between characters. A character can jump up to reach an overhead ledge, or similar object, that is as high as his own height, plus about one metre for average arm length, plus another half a metre for an average standing jump. Usually, no test is required to make such a jump, though pulling oneself up onto a grabbed ledge requires a **Challenging (+0) Strength Test**.

A character can attempt to safely jump down a number of metres equal to his Agility Bonus by making a **Challenging (+0) Agility Test**. If he succeeds, he lands on his feet and takes no damage. If he succeeds, but the jump is a greater distance than his Agility Bonus, he takes Falling Damage  equal to the distance jumped in metres beyond his Agility Bonus and ends his Turn prone. If he fails the Agility Test, he suffers Falling Damage for the entire distance of the jump and ends his Turn prone.
##### Running Vertical Jumps
If a character gets a running start by moving at least four metres in a straight line, he can jump higher. At the end of his movement, he must make a **Challenging (+0) Agility Test**. If he succeeds, he can add half his Strength Bonus (rounded up) in metres to his normal vertical jump distance (see above), plus an additional half metre for each degree of success. If he fails the test, he stumbles, which ends his Turn. For every four additional metres beyond the first four that a character runs before making a Jump, he receives a +10 bonus to his Agility Test, up to a maximum of +30.
##### Standing Horizontal Leaps
To make a Standing Horizontal Leap, a character must make a **Difficult (–10) Agility Test**. On a success, he leaps a number of metres equal to his Strength Bonus, plus another half metre for each degree of success. On a failure, he only Leaps a number of metres equal to half his Strength Bonus (round up), and each degree of failure further reduces this distance by another half metre (to a minimum of one-half metre).

The height attained while leaping is equal to one quarter the distance in metres travelled (round up).
##### Running Horizontal Leaps
When performing a Running Horizontal Leap, a character must move at least four metres in a straight line before making the Leap. At the end of his movement, he makes a **Challenging (+0) Agility Test**. On a success, he Leaps number of metres equal to his Strength Bonus, plus another half metre for each degree of success. On a failure, he only Leaps a number of metres equal to half his Strength Bonus (round up), and each degree of failure further reduces this distance by another half metre (to a minimum of one-half metre). For every four additional metres beyond the first four that a character runs before making a Leap, he receives a +10 bonus to his Agility Test, up to a maximum of +30.

The height attained while leaping is equal to one quarter the distance in metres travelled (round up).

#### **Manoeuvre (Half Action)**

By using superior footwork and aggression, you can force your opponent to move one metre in a direction of your choosing by succeeding on an Opposed Weapon Skill Test. If desired, you can advance one metre in the same direction as well. The opponent cannot be forced into another character or some other obstacle (a wall, a barrel, a Grox, and so on).
#### **Move (Half or Full Action)**

You can make a short move, suitable for tactical relocation into a more advantageous position. If you spend a Half Action to move (also known as a Half Move), you may move a number of metres equal to your Agility Bonus. If you use a Full Action (a Full Move), you may move twice this distance. Whenever you end your movement adjacent to an opponent you may engage that opponent in melee. If you move away from an opponent with whom you are engaged in melee the same opponent may make a free Standard Attack against you (see **Fleeing** above).
#### **Run (Full Action)**

You run at full speed and may move a number of metres up to six times your Agility Bonus. Your swift movement makes you harder to hit with ranged weapons, but easier prey for melee attacks as you cannot easily defend yourself while moving so quickly. Until the beginning of your next Turn, ranged attacks made against you take a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests, but melee attacks gain a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests.
#### **Stand/Mount (Half Action)**

You can stand up if currently on the ground, or if you're already standing, mount a riding beast or a vehicle.
#### **Tactical Advance (Full Action)**

You move from one position of cover to another, keeping yourself protected from gunfire whilst traversing the battlefield. While making a Tactical Advance you can move up to your Full Move rate. As long as you begin and end your movement behind a piece of cover you benefit from the average value of the pieces of cover you are moving between for the duration of the move. This is especially valuable if you find yourself caught by a heavy weapon in Overwatch, or a sniper with a Delayed shot that was waiting in ambush for you.
### **Miscellaneous Actions**

Miscellaneous Actions encompass everything else you might wish to do in combat.
#### **Aim (Half or Full Action)**

You take extra time to set up a more precise attack. If you spend a Half Action to aim, your next attack is made at a +10 to your Weapon Skill (for melee attacks) or Ballistic Skill (for ranged attacks). If you spend a Full Action Aiming, the bonus increases to +20. The next Action you take after Aiming must be an attack or the benefits of Aiming are lost—this includes if you make a Reaction before attacking. 
#### **Delay (Half Action)**

Sometimes it is more prudent to wait for an opportunity than to act immediately. When you use the Delay Action, your Turn ends immediately, but you reserve a Half Action for later use—you need not declare in advance what Half Action you wish to reserve. Any time before the start of your next Turn you can take your reserved Half Action, including interrupting another character's Actions in the Initiative Order. If the reserved Half Action is not taken before the start of your next Turn it is lost.

If two or more characters both attempt to perform a Delayed Half Action at the same time they must make an **Opposed Agility Test** to determine who acts first.
##### Example
*It is Castella’s Turn in the Initiative Order, and she wants to shoot the mutant that is currently Grappling her friend Rasmus. If Castella shoots now, she will suffer a –20 penalty to her Ballistic Skill Test for **Shooting into Melee Combat**. But, she thinks Rasmus has a good chance of breaking free of the mutant’s Grapple on his Turn, so she chooses to Delay, which takes a Half Action and ends her Turn. Later in the same Round, it is Rasmus' Turn. He breaks free of the Grapple and moves away from the mutant, which is exactly the opportunity Castella was hoping for. Castella now performs her Delayed action, which must be a Half Action since that is all she has remaining. She chooses to make a Standard Attack and shoots the mutant.*
#### **Dodge (Reaction)**

Dodge is a Reaction that you can perform even when it isn't your Turn. Once a hit against you has been scored, but before Damage is rolled, you can attempt to Dodge—note that you must be aware of the attack (that is, not be Surprised or Unaware) if you wish to Dodge it. 

Make a Dodge Skill Test. If you succeed, you get out of the way at the last moment. The attack is negated and no Damage is rolled. If you fail the Dodge Test, the attack connects and your opponent may roll Damage as usual. You may Dodge both melee and ranged attacks, along with certain other things, such as explosions, flamer fire, and being run over by a vehicle.

Note that as Dodge is a Basic Skill you may attempt it even if you aren't trained.
##### Example
*It seems that the barman has taken exception to Drake’s crass treatment of his paying customers and on his Initiative, starts combat by swinging at the Guardsman with a shock maul. The barman makes a Weapon Skill Test and hits. Drake can Test Dodge to get out of the way. He rolls the dice and compares the result to his Agility. He succeeds and manages to duck beneath the arc of the shock maul.*
##### **Dodging Auto-Fire and Area Attacks**

Some attacks require special considerations to Dodge them, either because they cover a large area, such as a grenade or flamer, or because they saturate the air with bullets, like a weapon firing a Full Auto Burst.

To avoid an area effect weapon, such as a flamer, you make a Dodge Test as normal, but the closest edge of the area of effect must be no further away than your Agility Bonus in metres. With a success, you immediately move to the closest edge of the area of effect, thus avoiding the attack. If you would need to move further than this to avoid the attack then your Dodge Test automatically fails regardless of how well you roll.

If you are struck by multiple hits from the same attack, such as by a Semi-Auto or Full Auto Burst, or a weapon with the Scatter quality, a successful Dodge Test negates one hit, plus an additional hit for each degree of success.
##### Example
*Confessor Varn has just finished beheading a heretic in the Emperor's name when he is shot at by a mutant brute with an autogun. The brute fires a Full Auto Burst and gets two degrees of success on his Ballistic Skill Test, for a total of three hits on Confessor Varn. Being wise in the ways of the galaxy, Confessor Varn decides to use his Reaction to attempt to Dodge the attack. His Agility is 38 and he has Dodge trained, so he needs to roll 38 or less on his Dodge Test. He rolls a 15 and gets two degrees of success. He has avoided all hits from the Full Auto Burst and escaped all damage—a miracle! If the good Confessor's Dodge Test had rolled slightly higher, resulting in only a single degree of success, he would have managed to avoid two bullets but still been struck by the third.*
#### **Focus Power (Varies)**

This Action is used to manifest a Psychic Power. How long the Focus Power Action takes is dependant on the power being manifested—each Psychic Power will indicate its Focus Time in the power's description. When you take this Action you may roll a number of dice equal to your Psy Rating. Add your Willpower Bonus, then compare the total to the Psychic Threshold (PT) of the Psychic Power you are attempting to manifest. If this number equals or exceeds the PT, you successfully manifest the power; if it doesn't, you are unable to manifest the Psychic Power and this Action is wasted.
#### **Parry**

If you are struck by a melee attack and are not Surprised or caught Unaware you may attempt to Parry the blow aside. Once a hit against you has been scored, but before Damage is rolled, you can attempt to Parry by Testing Weapon Skill. If you succeed, you beat back the attack and it is considered to have missed. If you fail your Weapon Skill Test the attack connects and your opponent may roll for Damage as usual. 

Parrying requires no special Skill or Talent to attempt, and can be made while wielding most weapons. A melee weapon is usually the best choice to attempt a Parry with, but you can also utilise most ranged weapons in a pinch, and can even Parry whilst Unarmed.
#### **Ready (Half Action)**

The Ready Action is used to manipulate various objects and gear items. Some common uses of the Ready Action are:

* Draw a weapon from a sheath or holster, or retrieve an object stowed in a pouch or pocket.
* Stow or put away a weapon or object you are currently holding.
* Pick up an object off the ground. 
* Open or close a door. 
* Apply poison to a weapon.
* Use a drug with a hypo-spray. 

Note that dropping an item on the ground is usually a Free Action. You may use the Ready Action twice in one Round if you are using it with two different items.
#### **Reload (Varies)**

You can reload a ranged weapon. The amount of time the Reload Action takes is dependent on the individual weapon in question, and will be indicated under the **Rld (Reload)** column on the relevant Weapon table. Note that any Reload Action that is spread across more than one Round is an Extended Action.
##### Example
*Garvel is in a pitched battle with Heretic X. He starts his Turn by firing the last shot from his Laspistol using a Half Action. With a Half Action left in his Turn, he starts reloading by jettisoning the spent charge pack. His Laspistol's Reload time is Full, so he continues the process with the first Half Action of his next Turn, retrieving a fresh charge pack from his belt and installing it in the Laspistol's grip. This completes his Reload Action, and he can fire a shot from it as his second Half Action of that Round.*
#### **Use a Skill (Varies)**

You may use a Skill. This usually involves making a Skill Test. This can be an Extended Action, depending on the Skill and the circumstances.
# **THE ATTACK**

The most common Action in combat is the attack—you are fighting, after all. Whether armed with a melee or ranged weapon, or even your bare hands, the process is about the same. 

Before an attack is made, the GM should verify that the attack is even possible by checking the basic requirements for the attack. Melee attacks generally require you to be engaged in melee combat with your target, while ranged attacks cannot usually be made if you're engaged in melee unless you're firing a pistol class weapon. In either case, you must be aware of your target (but see **Spray and Pray** below for some exceptions).

Assuming the attack is possible, follow these steps to resolve attacks in combat:

* Step One: Apply Modifiers to Attacker’s Characteristic
* Step Two: Attacker Makes a test
* Step Three: Attacker Determine Hit Location
* Step Four: Attacker Determines Damage
* Step Five: Target Applies Damage
### **Step One: Apply Modifiers to Attacker’s Characteristic**
A melee attack requires you to make Weapon Skill Test to hit, while a ranged attack requires a Ballistic Skill Test. There are many instances where one or more factors make performing an attack easier, or more difficult, than normal. For example, using the Full Auto Burst Action grants a +20 bonus to your Ballistic Skill Test, while firing at a target at Long Range imposes a –10 penalty.

If a situation calls for two or more bonuses or penalties, simply combine all modifiers together and apply the total to the appropriate Characteristic (see Combining Difficulties below).

The maximum total bonus that can be applied to a test is +60. Conversely, the maximum total penalty that can be applied to a test is –60.

When adjudicating difficulty, common sense should prevail. Regardless of the usual limits on test penalties, some actions are simply impossible.
##### Example
*Grak wants to use a Standard Attack action to shoot his laspistol at a ferocious creature that is trying to eat his friend Titus. Grak’s Ballistic Skill is 45 and he is at short range, which grants him a +10 bonus. Grak spends a Half Action to Aim, granting him another +10 bonus. However, there is a lot of heavy mist in the area so Grak will suffer a –20 penalty for that, and his target, the creature, is engaged in melee with Titus, so Grak will also suffer –20 penalty for shooting into melee combat. After all bonuses and penalties have been combined, Grak will need to roll 25 or less on his Ballistic Skill Test to hit the creature (45 + 10 + 10 – 20 – 20 = 25).*
### **Step Two: Attacker Makes a Test**
After the modified Characteristic has been determined, you Test Weapon Skill if you are performing a melee attack and Test Ballistic Skill if performing a ranged attack. Both of these are resolved like any other Test. If the roll is equal or less than the modified Characteristic, the attack hits (but see **Dodge and Parry Reactions**, below).
##### Example
*Grak makes a Ballistic Skill Test by rolling percentile dice and gets 14, which is less than his modified Ballistic Skill of 25. His attack hits the ferocious creature.*
#### **Dodge and Parry Reactions**
When your opponent is hit by your attack, he may have a chance to negate the hit with a Dodge or Parry Reaction. If the Dodge or Parry attempt is successful, the attack is negated and no Damage is dealt.
##### Example
*After Grak’s laspistol shot hits the ferocious creature, the GM rules that the creature will attempt to Dodge the attack. The creature’s Agility is 30, but it does not have the Dodge Skill trained, so it can only use half its Agility score of 15 for the Dodge Test. The GM rolls for the creature and gets a 57. The creature fails to Dodge the attack.*

Rare pieces of tech or equipment, such as extremely heavy personal armour or defence field devices, may also be able to negate an attack that otherwise should have hit.
### **Step Three: Attacker Determines Hit Location**
On a successful hit, and assuming the attack is being made against a vaguely humanoid opponent, you need to determine where the hit landed. Using the percentile dice result from your Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test, reverse the order of the digits (e.g., a roll of 32 becomes 23, a roll of 20 becomes 02, and so on) and compare this number to **Table: Hit Locations**. If you must hit a specific location on your opponent, you may bypass this step with the Called Shot Action.

| Table: Hit Locations |              |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| **Roll**             | **Location** |
| 01–10                | Head         |
| 11–20                | Right Arm    |
| 21–30                | Left Arm     |
| 31–70                | Body         |
| 71–85                | Right Leg    |
| 86–00                | Left Leg     |
The GM should feel free to adjust these values, or dispense with them entirely, for attacks being made against creatures with more unusual anatomical profiles, vehicles, and the like.
##### Example
*Grak’s Ballistic Skill Test to hit the ferocious creature resulted in a percentile dice roll of 14. He reverses these digits and gets 41. Consulting **Table: Hit Locations**, he sees he as hit the creature’s body.*
### **Step Four: Attacker Determines Damage**
After the hit location has been determined, you determine the Damage dealt by your attack. Each weapon has a Damage listing, which is usually a d10 die roll, plus or minus a number. Roll the appropriate die and apply any indicated modifiers. **If the attack involved a melee weapon, add your Strength Bonus as well.** The result is the Damage total. 

Whenever you make any attack roll, count the degrees of success, if any. You may choose to replace the result of a single Damage dice with the number of degrees of success from your attack roll. If the attack inflicts more than one dice of Damage, you may replace the result on one dice of your choice with the degrees of success from the attack roll.

If a natural 10 is rolled on any of your Damage dice, you have a chance of **Righteous Fury!**
#### **Righteous Fury!**
When rolling Damage after a successful attack, if any of your Damage dice rolled a natural 10 (or a 5 if your attack rolls a d5 die), there is a chance the Emperor’s favour is with you. This calls for a second attack roll, Testing Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill as if you were making another attack, including the same modifiers as the first one. If your second attack hits, the Emperor's vengeful spirit is indeed within you, aiding the strength of your attack with His divine might. You may roll one additional Damage die, adding it to the Damage total from before.

If the additional Damage die roll also results in a natural 10 (or a 5 on a d5), the Emperor's radiant glory has truly fallen upon you, and you may roll yet another Damage die and add it to the Damage total. This process continues until you roll a number other than 10 (or 5 on a d5).

Note that if you are rolling multiple dice when dealing Damage, such as with especially powerful weapons, you can only inflict Righteous Fury once per hit. If you happen to roll two 10s, you may make a second Test for each. This allows you two chances to inflict Righteous Fury, but should you succeed on both, you may still only roll additional dice on one.
##### Example
*Grak has hit the ferocious creature with his laspistol and proceeds to make his Damage roll. A laspistol deals 1d10+2 points of Damage. Grak rolls 1d10 and gets a 10, a possible Righteous Fury! Grak then makes a second attack roll identical to his first, which is a Ballistic Skill Test using Grak’s modified Ballistic Skill of 25. Grak makes a percentile roll and gets 22, which is a hit! Grak now makes a second damage roll of 1d10 and gets a 6. Grak’s damage total for this attack is 18 (10 + 2 + 6 = 18). The Emperor has truly smiled upon Grak this day.*
### **Step Five: Target Applies Damage**
From the Damage total, your opponent subtracts his Toughness Bonus and any Armour Points that protect the location hit by your attack. If this reduces the Damage to zero or less, your opponent shrugs off the attack entirely. 

Any remaining Damage is recorded by your opponent as Damage. If your target’s Damage equals or exceeds his Wounds, he notes any excess damage as Critical Damage and the GM consults the appropriate Critical Damage table based on the type of damage, the location hit, and the amount of Critical Damage accumulated.
##### Example
*Grak’s laspistol shot has struck the ferocious creature’s body for 18 total Damage, a mighty blow. The GM notes the creature’s Toughness Bonus is 3 and it does not have any Armour Points protecting its body. He subtracts three points from the total damage, leaving 15. The creature has only 12 Wounds, so it thuds to the ground dead.*
## **Review: Attacking and Dealing Damage**

This section summarises the fundamentals of attacking your opponents and inflicting Damage on them.
#### **Melee Attacks**

* To attack an opponent with a melee weapon or while unarmed you must generally be adjacent to him.
* Make a Weapon Skill Test, accounting for all applicable modifiers. If you succeed, your melee attack hits your opponent.
* Melee attacks can be Dodged or Parried if your opponent is capable of doing so.
* When dealing Damage add your Strength Bonus to the total unless otherwise stated in your weapon's description.
#### **Ranged Attacks**

* Most ranged weapons cannot be used whilst you are Engaged in Melee (see below). Pistol-class weapons are generally an exception to this rule.
* Make a Ballistic Skill Test, accounting for all applicable modifiers. If you succeed, your ranged attack hits your opponent.
* Ranged attacks can be Dodged but generally cannot be Parried.
* Most ranged weapons can be used as a melee weapon if necessary.
##### Example
*Father Horst is fighting in a mud-filled trench on a Throne-forsaken battlefield. A crazed Chaos worshipper moves in to attack Horst, and misses. Hefting his blessed hammer, Horst swings at the degenerate scum. He Tests Weapon Skill, rolling a 32 against his Weapon Skill of 39. Success! His attack hits. The Damage of Horst's hammer is 1d10+3. Horst rolls a 6 on his Damage die, and then adds the Damage modifier of 3. Finally, Horst adds his Strength Bonus of 2 (his Strength is 29). In total, Horst has dealt 11 points of Impact Damage (6+3+2=11) to the heretic.*
# **SPECIAL RULES AND COMBAT CIRCUMSTANCES**

This section covers the minutia of specific combat circumstances and situations beyond the basics of attack and defence described above.

Combat circumstances can be used to reflect the effects of terrain, the weather, tactical situations, questions governing certain weapon handling and usage, and a variety of other factors. Many circumstances alter the difficulty of tasks by providing bonuses or penalties to Tests, while others provide opportunities for you to leverage good fortune, or exploit misfortunes that befall your enemies. Acolytes should make as much use of beneficial circumstances as possible. A good plan, suitable equipment, and skilful use of tactics can often make the difference between life and death for an Acolyte of the Imperial Inquisition.

Given the endless potential for gripping, dramatic, white-knuckle combat in the Emperor's service against myriad and diverse foes these rules may not cover all possible eventualities that could arise in a combat situation. Treat these as a guide to cover any strange or uncommon circumstances, and as always the GM has final say about the Difficulty, or indeed possibility, of any particular Test or the outcome of an unusual situation.
#### **A Note on Combining Difficulties**

There will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more or less difficult than normal. For example, while in a shadowy hanger bay, trying to shoot at an opponent at long range is harder that shooting at the same opponent if the hanger was brightly lit. To combine multiple factors, use the following guidelines:

- If the situation would apply two or more penalties, add the modifiers together to a maximum of –60. For example, shooting through fog and making a Called Shot against a specific location on your opponent each make a **Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill Test**. Combining both difficulties together, the Test would be –40.
- If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new Difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow might be a **Very Hard (–30) Test**. But attacking an opponent who is Stunned is a **Routine (+20) Test**. If you somehow found yourself in a situation where both apply, the Test would be **Difficult (–10)** since –30 and +20 equals –10.
- If the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together, up to a maximum of +60. Two characters that attack the same Stunned opponent would ordinarily gain a +10 bonus for ganging up and a +20 bonus for attacking a Stunned target, thus their Weapon Skill Tests to hit that opponent are **Easy (+30)**.

When adjudicating Difficulty, common sense should prevail. No matter what limit there is on Test penalties, some shots are simply not possible.
## **Cover**

Cover is a vital part of surviving a firefight, and a good Acolyte knows that you go for your cover first and then draw your gun. There are no penalties to Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets standing partly behind cover. However, there is a chance that the shot may hit the cover rather than the target. 

Depending on the nature of the cover in question, some or all of a target's hit locations may be behind cover. Unless you are attempting a rather crude form of psychological warfare, as a rule of thumb, you must generally expose at least your head and whichever arm (or arms) are wielding the weapon. 

If the shot would strike a hit location that is concealed behind cover, work out the Damage against the Armour Points of the cover instead, with any excess being applied to the target as normal. A selection of common cover examples is provided below:

| Cover Type                                                  | Cover AP |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------: |
| Armour-glass, generatoria pipes, thin metal, wooden planks  |        4 |
| Flakboard, storage crates, sandbags, thick ice, trees       |        8 |
| Cogitator bank, typical ground car or lorry body            |       12 |
| Rockcrete, hatchway, iron structural components             |       16 |
| Ceramite plate, heavy plasteel structure, voidship bulkhead |       32 |
#### **Damaging Cover**
Cover is not invulnerable. Successive attacks can damage or destroy the protection afforded by cover. Each successful hit against cover that deals any amount of Damage in excess of the Armour Points it provides reduces the cover’s Armour Points by 1. 
##### Example
*Titus has taken cover behind a small pile of sandbags while a gun servitor blasts at him with its twin-linked autoguns. The gun servitor fires a Full Auto Burst and hits Titus three times for 8, 11, and 8 points of Damage. Fortunately for Titus, all of the hits would have struck either his legs or body, so they are absorbed by the sandbags instead. The first hit is fully absorbed by the sandbags to no effect because they provide 8 Armour Points of protection. The second hit’s Damage is reduced by 8, leaving 3 points of excess Damage, which reduces the sandbag’s AP to 7. The third hit’s Damage is reduced by 7, leaving 1 point of excess Damage, which further reduces the sandbag’s AP to 6. Titus' Toughness Bonus alone absorbs all of the excess Damage that went through, but he would do well to find a new piece of cover, or destroy the attacking servitor, before its pneumo-hammering Full Auto Bursts completely cut through the sandbags.*
## **Darkness**

Assuming you have typical human senses, Weapon Skill Tests made in darkness are **Hard (–20)**, while Ballistic Skill Tests are **Very Hard (–30)**. While a Character is concealed by darkness, Concealment Skill Tests are **Routine (+20)**. 

Having access to a good light source, a device that allows you to see in the dark, or superior senses can reduce or completely eliminate these penalties.
## **Difficult Terrain**

Having poor footing can be deleterious to your effectiveness in combat. Weapon Skill and Dodge Tests made whilst standing in difficult terrain suffer a penalty whose severity is dictated by the relative difficulty of the terrain. Mud or a very smooth, polished floor would be **Difficult (–10)**, a floor littered with loose debris would be **Hard (–20)**, and deep snow or a slick sheet of ice would be **Very Hard (–30)**.
## **Engaged in Melee**

If you are attacking an adjacent opponent with a melee weapon—including if you are using a ranged weapon as a melee weapon—both you and your target are considered to be "Engaged in Melee". This circumstance continues until one character moves away from the other, or neither is attacking one another. While engaged in melee there are certain restrictions placed on making ranged attacks, and moving away from your opponent without using the Disengage Action grants them a free melee attack against you.
##### Example
*Father Horst is continuing his pitched battle against the Chaos-worshipping cultist. As they are both adjacent to one another and trading blows, Horst and the heretic are each considered to be Engaged in Melee. On his Turn, Horst strikes a telling blow against the renegade, inflicting Critical Damage to his head and leaving him Stunned. The heretic may take no Actions while Stunned, so it quickly becomes Horst's Turn once again.* 

*Preparing to finish off the staggering renegade, Horst providentially realises the heretic's cohort some metres away is lining up a shot on him with an autogun. If Horst attacks the renegade again to end him rightly the good preacher will remain Engaged in Melee, giving him limited recourse towards the hot bullets about to head his way. Quickly considering his options, Horst decides the gun-armed heretic is the most immediate threat. Dropping his trusty hammer (a Free Action), Horst uses Ready (a Half Action) to snatch up a single-shot grenade launcher leaning up against the trench wall, and makes a Standard Attack (also a Half Action) to loose a frag grenade towards the other heretic. The grenade sails over his fellow's shoulder and explodes, blasting the gun-armed cultist to ragged pieces.*

*The grenade launcher is a basic weapon—ordinarily, Horst would not be allowed to make a ranged attack with it due to his adjacency to the renegade cultist. However, as neither Horst nor the renegade have attacked one another this Round, they are not considered to be Engaged in Melee, even though they are adjacent to each other.* 
## **Fatigued**

When a character is Fatigued all their Tests, including any Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests, suffer a –10 penalty.
## **Fog, Mist, Shadow or Smoke**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets concealed by fog, mist, shadow or smoke are **Hard (–20)**. While a character is concealed by any of these conditions his Concealment Skill Tests are **Ordinary (+10)**. The GM should feel free to adjust these circumstantial modifiers up or down if the obscuring conditions are minor or especially heavy.
## **Ganging Up**

You have an advantage when you and your allies engage the same foe in melee combat. If you outnumber your opponent two to one, your Weapon Skill Tests are **Ordinary (+10)**. If you outnumber your opponent by three to one or more, your Weapon Skill Tests are **Routine (+20)**.

Note that you need not be attacking the same opponent from a flanking position to receive the benefits of Ganging Up—simply having to fend off two sets of blades at once is sufficient.
## **Helpless Targets**

A sleeping, unconscious, paralysed, or tightly restrained target requires minimal effort to strike a felling blow. Weapon Skill Tests, as well as Ballistic Skill Tests if you are within Point Blank Range, made against a Helpless target automatically succeed. When rolling Damage against such a target roll twice and add the results, including any additional Damage from the weapon type or your Strength Bonus. Should you happen to roll a 10 against this unfortunate foe you automatically gain Righteous Fury, and may roll Damage again as normal.
## **Higher Ground**

Having the high ground makes it easier for you to swing a weapon down against your enemies. If you have a significant height advantage—such as standing on a table, striking from the saddle of a riding mount, fighting from the top of a mound of dead foes, and so on—your Weapon Skill Tests made against those below you are **Ordinary (+10).**
## **Missing**

Ordinarily, missing your foe with an attack has no further consequences beyond the fact that your opponent still draws breath. However, sometimes it is important to know where an attack lands that hasn't struck true. 

From time to time the GM may need to adjudicate the path of an errant bullet or las blast—for example, if there's an extremely flammable or unstable piece of scenery that the aforementioned projectile may strike. More commonly, you'll want to know where a throwing knife, or especially a grenade, ended up landing after a failed Ballistic Skill Test (or a successful Dodge by your opponent!). 

Should it be necessary, such as when weapons with the Blast Quality are involved, the GM rolls 1d10 and consults the **Scatter Diagram** below. Ordinarily, the GM will also roll 1d5 to determine how many metres the weapon travels in the indicated direction, although this distance could be significantly greater with heavy weapons like missiles and mortars.
##### **Scatter Diagram**

|  **1 🡔**  |   **2 🡑**   |  **3 🡕**  |
| :------: | :--------: | :------: |
|  **4 🡐**  | **TARGET** |  **5 🡒**  |
| **6-7 🡗** |   **8 🡓**   | **9-0 🡖** |
##### **Scattering in Zero Gravity**
The consequences of throwing dangerous objects in a zero gravity environment can be as unpredictable as they are deadly. Should you find yourself in an environment with no gravity, such as aboard a voidship with malfunctioning grav-plating, and need to determine exactly where that krak grenade floats after it bounces off the bulkhead, simply roll twice on the Scatter Diagram—once for the X axis and once for the Y axis.
## **Off Hand Attacks**

Most humans have greater dexterity and control with one hand than the other. Your dominant hand (typically the right) is considered your primary, while your non-dominant hand (typically the left) is considered your secondary. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made whilst you're using a weapon in your secondary hand are considered **Hard (–20)**. While typically a concern for those fighting with two weapons, you would do well to keep this in mind if your primary hand is injured and you are unable to use a weapon with it!

If you have the Ambidextrous Talent you are equally capable with either hand and do not suffer this penalty.
## **Pinning**

Being shot at is a terrifying experience. While most common Imperial citizens will flee from ordinary gunfire, even an inexperienced Acolyte knows that more is expected of him. Normally, you may still act freely while bullets and las blasts are zipping through the air around you, but certain situations may compel your survival instincts to tell you to stay in cover. 

If you are caught in Suppressing Fire, or the effects of certain other weapons, you must make a **Pinning Test** by Testing Willpower. The calamitous rattle of a heavy weapon, such as a heavy stubber or multi-laser, increases the difficulty of the **Pinning Test** to **Hard (–20)**. Note that you must make a Pinning Test even if you are behind cover, or if you are struck by a projectile but suffer no Damage due to armour or Toughness Bonus. If you succeed you may act normally, including charging headlong into the storm of bullets if you so desire. On a failure, your baser instincts take over and you become Pinned.

Note that Pinning is a fear effect, so Talents such as Fearless or Resistance (Fear) would apply against it.
#### **Being Pinned**

Unless you are already in cover relative to the attacker who has Pinned you you must move towards the nearest piece of cover you can fully hide behind at your best speed. If there is no obvious cover available then you simply flee from your attacker—hopefully some distance will make you harder to hit by his barrage. Once in cover you may only take Half Actions and may not leave your place of cover unless you are trying to move to another piece that is further away. Furthermore, you suffer a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests whilst Pinned, the fearful racket forcing you to shakily snap off shots instead of focusing on your aim.

Pinning lasts until the end of combat or until the attacker who has Pinned you is obviously no longer a threat. If you wish to steel your nerves and get back in the fight sooner, you may Test Willpower at the end of your Turn. If you succeed you shake off your fear and may act normally on your next Turn. Your Willpower Test becomes **Easy (+30)** if you are no longer under fire (i.e. no enemies have tried to shoot you since your last Turn). If an opponent engages you in melee combat you automatically escape Pinning—a sharp blade dancing before your face quickly makes you forget all about the bullet impacts.
##### Example
*Vos is being pursued through a slum overrun by abhuman mutants, three of which hunger for his untainted flesh. Fortunately for him, he has found the immobilised wreck of an enforcer patrol cruiser, which still has a pintle-mounted heavy stubber on its roof! Vos assumes command of the powerful weapon, but now realises its ammunition hopper only has a dozen or so rounds left in it—insufficient to gun down the trio of mutants that are bearing down on him.*

*Instead, Vos sensibly decides to use the weapon to buy him time to escape, utilising the Suppressing Fire Action and choosing the alley the mutants are about to burst out from as his kill zone. Each mutant must make a make a **Hard (–20) Pinning Test** to ignore the terrifying effects of Vos' Suppressing Fire. All three fail, meaning they will be forced to duck back into the alley and out of the way of Vos' barrage on their next Turn. Vos now makes a **Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill Test** to see if his volley has struck any of the mutants as well. He rolls a 55, which is already greater than his Ballistic Skill, so none of his bullets hit.*

*On their Turn each mutant spends a Full Action to run back into the relative safety of the alley, after which they are entitled to Test Willpower to see if their hunger for Vos meat is greater than their fear of his bullets. One succeeds, while the other two fail.*

*With only a few bullets left in the hopper, Vos smartly bails out of the cruiser and flees down the road at best speed. The mutant which managed to escape Pinning is free to pursue him on its Turn, while the other two must remain in cover for another Round. At the end of their Turn each mutant makes an **Easy (+30) Willpower Test** to escape Pinning, as they are no longer under fire. This time both succeed and may leave cover on their next Turn—by which time Vos is well out of sight. The shrewd warrior now need only fight off the single mutant which has managed to stay on his trail, a much more favourable battle for him!*
## **Prone**

You are Prone any time you are lying on the ground. You may be sent Prone by being Knocked Down by an enemy attack, blown off your feet by the concussion of an explosion, or making yourself Prone by diving for cover.

While Prone you are more vulnerable to melee attacks—Weapon Skill Tests made against you are **Ordinary (+10)**, and you suffer a  –10 penalty to your own Weapon Skill Tests, including those made to Parry. Furthermore, Dodge Tests made whilst Prone are **Hard (–20)**, reflecting your reduced mobility.

Being Prone does make you harder to hit with ranged attacks, and all Ballistic Skill Tests made against you are **Difficult (–10)**, unless your attacker is at Point Blank Range.

Assuming you are not being Grappled or otherwise have your movement impaired you can generally drop Prone as a Free Action.
## **Range**

When making a ranged attack your relative distance to the target can impose bonuses or penalties on your Ballistic Skill Tests, with closer opponents being easier to hit than those further away. Range brackets fall into four categories:
#### Point Blank
At this range it is difficult to miss! You are considered to be at Point Blank Range if you are within three metres of your opponent, but NOT if you are Engaged in Melee with him. Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack a target at Point Blank Range are **Easy (+30)**.

Note that for weapons with a Short range of less than three metres, Point Blank Range is one metre less than the weapon's Short range.
#### Short
Targets that are at a distance of less than half the Range of your weapon are considered to be at Short Range. Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets at Short Range are **Ordinary (+10)**.
#### Medium
Targets that are at a distance of greater than half but less than double the Range of your weapon are considered to be at Medium Range. Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets at Medium Range are **Challenging (+0)**.
#### Long
Targets that are at a distance of more than double the Range of your weapon are considered to be at Long Range. Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets at Long Range are **Difficult (–10)**.
#### Extreme
Targets that are at a distance of more than three times the Range of your weapon are considered to be at Extreme Range. Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets at Extreme Range are **Very Hard (–30)**. You cannot make aimed attacks at a target more than four times your weapon's Range distance away, although depending on the weapon your projectiles may still be capable of inflicting Damage against objects or area targets beyond that.
##### Example
*Hakeswill, a veteran of the Imperial Guard, takes a moment to review the range tables for his lasgun at the back of his copy of* The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer. *Experience has taught him that any opponent within three metres is an effortless shot (BS +30), but he'll need to resort to his bayonet if an enemy gets right up against him (Engaged in Melee).

*Hakeswill's lasgun has a Range statistic of 100 metres. Consulting the tables, he determines that targets between 3 and 50 metres are at Short Range (BS +10), those between 51 and 200 metres are at Medium Range (BS +0), those between 201 and 300 metres are at Long Range (BS –10),* *and those between 301 and 400 metres are at Extreme Range (BS –30).

*The* Primer *concludes that hitting a man-sized target at ranges beyond 400 metres is unrealistic, and in any event making such shots is not permitted by Departmento Munitorum regulation.* 
## **Shooting into Melee**

Sometimes circumstances may compel you to fire a ranged weapon against an opponent that's already trading blows with another party—possibly one of your allies! Ballistic Skill Tests against any opponent that is Engaged in Melee are **Hard (–20)**. If your target happens to become Helpless or Stunned, or is Unaware of your presence on the battlefield, you do not suffer this penalty.

Note that if you miss the target by a small margin (one degree of failure or less), the attack instead hits another target engaged in the same melee. If you are shooting into melee combat with a Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst and miss by one degree of failure or less, you must allocate multiple hits to different targets engaged in the melee. This can be especially perilous if you are trying to aid an ally that is presently engaged with your target.
## **Size**

Size is an important factor to consider in combat as it's usually easier to hit a larger target than a smaller one. All characters and creatures in ***Dark Heresy*** have a defined size category, and if necessary the GM should assign an appropriate size to an object (for example, if you wish to shoot out a pict-stealer before it alerts someone to your presence). Use **Table: Size Modifiers** for determining bonuses and penalties based on size.

| Table: Size Modifiers                        |                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | :-------------: |
| **Size Category (Example)**                  | To Hit Modifier |
| Minuscule (Door handle, knife)               |       –30       |
| Puny (Servo-skull, vapour rat)               |       –20       |
| Scrawny (Ash slug, human child)              |       –10       |
| Average (Human adult, most bipedal xenos)    |       +0        |
| Hulking (Grox, Space Marine)                 |       +10       |
| Enormous (Ravener, silt spider)              |       +20       |
| Massive (Battle tank, scar wyrm)             |       +30       |
| Immense (Biotitan, macro hauler)             |       +40       |
| Gargantuan (lesser battle titan, ore seeker) |       +50       |
| Colossal (Greater battle titan, Ordinatus)   |       +60       |
## **Spray and Pray

Ordinarily you must be aware of your target in order to attack it. If you suspect an enemy is present in an area, but you cannot confirm his presence, blasting away into underbrush or darkness may be a viable strategy. The Suppressing Fire Action can be an effective method of flushing an opponent out from concealment, as can lighting the general area on fire with a flamer.

The GM should adjudicate the outcome of fringe cases, and may impose appropriate penalties on your attack Tests, or dispense with that entirely in favour of an alternative solution. For example, say you hear a strange noise from down a pitch-black transit tunnel and fire off a barrage of bullets in that direction. As there happens to be a hulking mutant abomination creeping towards you in the darkness, the GM may rule that the creature was struck by some of your bullets, even if you weren't called to make a Ballistic Skill Test to shoot at it.
## **Stunned Targets**

A Stunned target has a much harder time defending itself against you. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack Stunned targets are **Routine (+20)**, and the target cannot attempt any Reactions to avoid your attacks either.
## **Two-Weapon Fighting**

Many warriors fight with a weapon in either hand, including any combination of blades, pistols, and shields. There are advantages and disadvantages to this style of fighting. While it offers greatly improved opportunities to make attacks, it also reduces the chances of successfully striking a target. Unless you happen to have the Ambidextrous Talent, make sure you note which weapon is held in your primary hand and which is in your secondary hand. 

The following considerations apply when you are fighting with two weapons:

- You may use any melee weapons or ranged weapons that may be wielded in one hand when fighting with two weapons. This includes most pistols and melee weapons, and a few especially manoeuvrable basic weapons as well. A small number of pistols and melee weapons require both hands to wield, making them unsuitable for two-weapon fighting.
- You may use either hand to make an attack. As usual, Test Weapon Skill for melee weapons and Ballistic Skill for ranged weapons. Attacks made using your secondary hand take a –20 penalty unless you have the Ambidextrous Talent.
- If you have the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent, you may use the Multiple Attacks Action to attack with both weapons. You take a –20 penalty to Tests made with the weapon in your primary hand and a –30 penalty to Tests made with your secondary hand. If you have the Ambidextrous Talent, the penalty to both attacks drops to –10.
- If you're wielding a melee weapon as one of your two weapons you may make a Parry once  each Round as a Reaction as normal with this weapon, though you still may not Parry more than once in a Round. If you are wielding a weapon with the Defensive Quality in your secondary hand, you do not suffer any of the usual penalties when making a Weapon Skill Test to Parry.
- If you have the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent and are armed with a melee weapon in one hand and a pistol in the other you may attack with both whilst Engaged in Melee by using the Multiple Attacks Action. Resolve each attack separately by Testing Weapon Skill for the melee attack and Ballistic Skill for the ranged attack. If you have a ranged weapon with the relevant fire modes available, you may use a Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst as part of the Multiple Attacks Action, but all hits must be against a target you are Engaged in Melee with.
- When firing a ranged weapon with each hand, assuming the weapons have different fire modes  available, you may fire each weapon on a different mode, for example, a Standard Attack with one and a Full Auto Burst with the other. If you use the Suppressing Fire Action with both weapons you may not designate two separate areas to suppress. Enemies caught in the area you are suppressing do not take any additional penalties, but you may roll two Ballistic Skill Tests to determine if you score any hits—one for each weapon.
- You may fire your weapons at different targets, but the targets must be within 10 metres of  each other.
## **Unarmed Combat**

Not every fight in ***Dark Heresy*** requires boltguns and power swords. Some conflicts can be settled the old–fashioned way with fists (not to mention feet and, if you're a dirty scummer, teeth). Unarmed attacks are made like any other melee attack, so you must be adjacent to your opponent and make a successful Weapon Skill Test to hit. If you are attacking a opponent who is armed with  weapon then your Weapon Skill Test to hit with an unarmed attack becomes **Hard (–20)**. 

A successful Weapon Skill Test made with an unarmed attack deals 1d5–3 Impact Damage, plus your Strength Bonus. This attack is considered Primitive, so keep in mind your opponent's Armour Points will likely count double against your attack. If you inflict Damage equal to or greater than your opponent's Toughness Bonus they also gain one level of Fatigue—if you need to take an opponent prisoner, pummelling them into submission with your fists is a very viable method.

As usual, if you roll a 5 on your Damage die you have a chance of inflicting Righteous Fury.
### **Grappling**

Instead of inflicting Damage with an unarmed attack, you can attempt to wrestle with your opponent by starting a Grapple. Attempting a Grapple is a melee attack which uses either a Standard Attack or the Charge Action if you prefer. Make your Weapon Skill Test as normal, and your opponent may use a Reaction to Dodge or Parry if he's able. If your attack succeeds then both you and your opponent are now Grappling, with you controlling the Grapple. As long as you are in control you may release your opponent and end the Grapple as a Free Action.

Whilst you are in a Grapple all of the following conditions apply:

* Participants in a Grapple cannot use Reactions.
* Participants in a Grapple are considered to be Engaged in Melee with each other, but are NOT Engaged in Melee with other adjacent characters who are not participating in the Grapple.
* Participants in a Grapple can only use the Grapple Action (see above).
* As a Free Action, the controller of the Grapple can voluntarily end the Grapple on his Turn.
* Other attackers gain a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests to hit any target engaged in a Grapple.

Only two characters can be engaged in the same Grapple, but up to two other characters can lend Assistance to each Grappler in certain conditions.
## **Unaware Targets**

When your target has no idea that he is about to be attacked he is considered to be Unaware. Usually this happens at the start of a combat where one or more characters are Surprised. Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack Unaware targets are **Easy (+30)**.
## **Weapon Jams**

Unlike a melee weapon, ranged weapons can malfunction in various ways that are generally disadvantageous to you. Whether it is due to improper maintenance, poor quality ammunition, an inherently unreliable design, or just the machine spirits feeling especially ornery in that moment, you should be prepared for a ranged weapon to fail at an inopportune moment.

Whenever you make a Ballistic Skill Test to attack with a ranged weapon and roll an unmodified result of 96 to 00, **in addition to being an automatic miss**, the weapon has Jammed. A Jammed weapon has been rendered inoperable and cannot be fired until it is cleared. To clear a Jam you must spend a Full Action and make Ballistic Skill Test. If the Test is successful then the Jam has been cleared. The weapon loses one shot worth of ammunition (dud rounds being removed from the chamber, promethium being drained from the feed hoses, and so forth) and must be reloaded before it can be fired again. If the Test is failed the weapon is still Jammed—you can attempt to clear it again next Round if you wish.

Some weapons can put you in great danger when they Jam, such as plasma guns and most explosives. Review your weapon's description carefully for special rules or conditions that may govern what happens when the weapon Jams. Additionally, note that certain combat actions, such as Full Auto Burst, increase the range at which a weapon may Jam.
