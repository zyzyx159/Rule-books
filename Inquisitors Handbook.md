# Introduction

The universe is imperilled by aggressive xenos, the unclean heretic, Daemons of the warp, and countless other threats, and standing against these many and varied horrors are the agents of the Inquisition, bold souls who have been selected for their talents, their skills and their loyalty to the Golden Throne. Yet even with these assets, these Acolytes stand little chance against the tide of doom that looms large over the demesne of God-Emperor without the proper training and tools, and even when so properly prepared, only a rare few of these blessed servants rise above the rest to claim their place alongside the Imperium's greatest heroes. T

The Inquisitor's Handbook is your indispensable guide to surviving the perils of the 41st Millennium. Functioning as a rules and setting expansion, this sourcebook explores all the dynamics that make up the Acolyte, offering new options, new weapons, armour and gear all to ensure that the servants of the God-Emperor are properly prepared before embarking on their mission into the belly of corruption in search of the witch, the heretic and xeno.

This sourcebook opens with a broad range of character creation options that include new origins, ranks, and a new career path to expand the choices available to players and to ensure that each Acolyte is a unique member of the retinue, bringing to bear a useful assortment of tools to aid in any investigation. Scattered throughout the first two chapters is further setting information, revealing more of the Calixis Sector and the dangers arrayed against it. Characters generated using these rules are every bit as capable as those in Dark Heresy, but offer even more firepower to established groups of investigators.

The book unfolds to take a broader look at the Calixis Sector itself, exploring the multitude of worlds through the lens of broad archetypes. Each chapter deals with a different sort of planet, ranging from the savage feral and feudal worlds to the labyrinthine hive worlds. Within these chapters are expansions for weapons, armour and general gear, all of which are tailored to the worlds that produce them, giving Player Characters more choices for armaments while also reflecting the idiosyncrasies of characters that hail from particular planets or spacecraft.

Following the world entries, the weapons and gear of the Holy Ordos are examined and the book then explores the religious side of the 41st Millennium, revealing secrets of the God-Emperor's cult and the sects that make up His diverse following. This chapter also shapes the role of the Acolyte within the larger body of God-Emperor's servants, while simultaneously offering in-game hooks to bind the characters more firmly to the setting.

Finally, the *Inquisitor's Handbook* examines life as an Acolyte, demonstrating the political intricacies of serving an Inquisitor, while offering rules expansions for using Skills in new and interesting ways. Any player looking for an edge against the endless enemies of the Imperium would do well to become familiar with this chapter.

#### **Weapon TrainingTalents** Weapon Training Talents

This book contains scores of new kinds of weapons, from slender stilettos to mighty assault cannons. All of these new weapons, however, are categorised into the same broad weapon types from Dark Heresy. So for instance, an Acolyte with the Basic Weapon Training (SP) talent will be able to use any of the Basic Solid Projectile weapons listed in this book.

#### **Weapon Statistics** Weapon Statistics

All of the weapons listed in this book use the following statistics.

**Name:** What the weapon is called.

**Class:** Describes what class the weapon is, either a Melee, Thrown, Pistol, Basic or Heavy weapon.

Melee weapons can be used in close combat. When using a Melee weapon you add your SB to the Damage you inflict.

Thrown weapons cover anything propelled by muscle power alone and covers knives, axes, spears and such like. Unless they are also classed as Melee, Thrown weapons cannot be used in close combat (or if they do they count as Improvised weapons). When using a Thrown weapon you add your SB to the Damage you inflict (with the exception of explosives such as grenades).

Pistol weapons are fired one handed and can be used in close combat. However, when a Pistol is used in close combat, the firer gains no bonuses or penalties to hit for range or targeting equipment.

Basic weapons normally require two hands but can be used one handed with a –20 penalty to hit.

Heavy weapons always require two hands and must be braced in someway, usually either on a bipod or tripod, but also on a windowsill or sandbag (or on the firer's shoulder in the case of RPG launchers), to be fired without penalties. Firing a Heavy weapon without bracing incurs a –30 penalty to hit and prohibits Semi-Automatic and Full Automatic fire.

**Range:** This number is used to determine how far the weapon can be accurately fired in metres. A weapon's Short Range is half this number while its Long Range is double this number (for ranged bonuses and penalties see page 198 in Dark Heresy). Weapons cannot be fired at targets over four times their range.

**RoF (Rate of Fire):** Tells you if the weapon can be fired either on Semi-Automatic or Full Automatic and how many rounds/charges it expends when doing so. A weapon's RoF has three entries to indicate the modes a weapon can be fired in. The first entry indicates whether the weapon can be fired singly (with an S). The second entry indicates whether or not a weapon can be fired semi-automatically and the number listed describes the number of shots fired. Finally, the third entry describes if the weapon can be fired on full automatic. Any mode in which the weapon cannot be fired is indicated with a "–".

Some weapons can be fired in more than one mode. If this is the case each of its different Rates of Fire will be listed in its profile. Characters must choose which mode they are firing their weapon in before making their attack.

Dam (Damage): The Damage the weapon does and the type of Damage it inflicts for the purpose of Criticals (as shown in brackets): (E) Energy, (X) Explosive, (R) Rending, (I) Impact.

**Pen (Penetration):** Reflects how good the weapon is at going through armour. When a shot from this weapon hits a target, reduce the target's Armour by the weapon's Penetration, with results of less than 0 counting as 0 (i.e. the armour provides no protection at all). Then work out Damage as normal. So, for example, if a weapon with a Penetration of 3 hits a target with 5 points of Armour, the target will only count as having 2 points of Armour against any Damage the hit causes. Note that Penetration has no effect on fields, but it does affect cover.

**Clip:** How many rounds/charges the weapon holds when fully loaded.

**Rld (Reload):** How many Actions the weapon takes to Reload. This is generally Half (for a Half Action) or Full (for a Full Action), though can take a number of Actions over several Rounds.

**Special:** This tells you if the weapon has any Special Qualities, such as creating a blast when fired or needing to recharge between shots.

**Wt (Weight):** Represents how much the weapon weighs.

**Cost:** Indicates the standard value of the weapon within the Imperium. Cost is always represented in Thrones.

**Availability:** This identifies the weapon's Availability (see Availability on page 125 in Dark Heresy).

— Inquisitor Serephus XII.

Dark Heresy provides a solid foundation on which players can create interesting and unique characters. However, the options provided in the core rulebook are just a sampling of the many and varied servants of the Inquisition. People of all walks, all occupations can come to find themselves recruited and working for the monolithic Inquisition, tearing back the façade of the Imperium to search for and destroy corruption, xenos threat and anything else that threatens the worlds of the God-Emperor. This chapter expands on the information in Dark Heresy by offering new home worlds, character origins and detailed backgrounds for Acolytes.

Forge Worlds

All characters must come from somewhere. Before their recruitment, they had lives and dreams. They had a place and a people, a history that has shaped their personalities and ambitions, as well as providing that first spark that drew the steely gaze of the Inquisitor. Home Worlds encapsulate a large part of a character's history, describing the sort of culture that produced the Acolyte, while also helping to define the character's nature and appearance. 

The following new Home Worlds offer a mix of new world types as well as signature events and upbringings that have had as deep and profound an impact on your character as being born on a particular type of world. These new Origins are treated in exactly the same way as Home Worlds. You can use Table 1-1: Random Home World/Origin to replace Table 1–1:Random Home World in Dark Heresy.

#### Table 1–1: Random Home World/Origin

 **Roll Result**

#### **(D100)**

- 01–15 **Feral World:** Feral worlders are born to worlds trapped in a state of barbarism. They are natural survivors, and are commonly big, strong and tough. Feral worlders make for characters that are exceptional at physical action and combat.
- 16–35 **Hive World:** Hivers are the products of vast a crowded hive cities. They are fast talking, quick thinking individuals accustomed to looking out for themselves—perfect if you want to play a roguish character who lives by their wits.
- 36–55 **Imperial World:** Much of humanity hails from one of the myriad civilized worlds of the Imperium, where, despite bewildering diversity, Imperial culture and faith in the God-Emperor is strong. Adaptable and varied, characters with this Origin make good all-rounders and have the widest choice of careers available to them.
- 56–65 **Void Born:** Born from the bloodlines of human star travellers, voiders have lived most of their lives in space within the metallic bastions of great vessels. Uncommonly lucky and strong willed, they are perfect if you want to play a psyker or risk-taking adventurer.
- 66–75 **Forge World:** Those raised in the shadow of the Omnissiah have survived the Machine God's harsh regime and possesses an innate familiarity with the higher mysteries of arcane science, making for excellent scholars and tech-priests.
- 76–85 **Schola Progenium:** Progena are orphans of Imperial servants trained in mind, body and spirit from birth. They make for superior warriors and knowledgeable leaders, if lacking in experience of life's more sordid side.
- 86–95 **Noble Born:** Nobles are privileged individuals, raised in wealth and steeped in tradition and etiquette. They are ideally suited for those who prefer charm and guile over brute force. Nobles make superb spies, diplomats and assassins.
- 96–00 **Mind Cleansed:** Those whose minds have been emptied of identity and their memories wiped or sealed off. These rare individuals have been "re-made" by their Inquisitorial masters to serve the Holy Ordos.

*"You were born in the shadow of the Omnissiah and all your life you have been surrounded with the great wonders and dire terrors of the Machine God's arts. Ever since you were born you have been weighed, measured, codified and tested so that your masters might find your place in the great pattern; an unforgiving process that has fitted you well for survival and supremacy."*

— Explorator Archmagos Thule, address prior to the Helstrom Pursuit.

The domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus are many, from the ceaseless industry of the iron realms of the forge worlds, to labyrinthine orbitals and distant research outposts, to the nomadic and self-contained void caravans of the explorator fleets. They are an empire within and empire, distinct and yet interwoven with the fabric of the Imperium. Their masters are as ancient, wise, mysterious and cold as the machineries they tend.

#### **Life on a Forge World**

Forge worlds are the beating iron heart of the Imperium and the sovereign domains of the Priesthood of Mars. They are given over to the demands of vast industrialisation and eternally hungry for new resources to consume. A forge world's wheels never cease to turn and day-in-day-out for millennia, the reactors blaze and the foundries thunder, turning out refined materials and high technology to meet the Imperium's unending needs. A forge world is also far more than the sum of its continentspanning manufactorums; each is blessed with a higher level of technological advancement than the wider Imperium as a whole, and many arcane and strange wonders are common currency in their baroque labyrinths of ferrocrete and steel. They are also home to vast repositories of data, knowledge and lore, with as much as a third of any given forge world's entire infrastructure consisting of endless scriptoriums, mimetic vaults and knowledge dumps, tended in perpetuity by mindless drones and generations of archive adepts.

A forge world's undisputed masters are the Magos and Adepts of the Cult Mechanicus who rule with harsh precision and cold logic. To them the human population of their domains are little more than cogs and gears in the great machine, resources to be measured, graded and used to fit their worth. At their direction, the bulk of a forge world's human population is utilised as a skilled and trained labour force, while the brightest and best are inducted to the Adeptus Mechanicus itself. The more militant are chosen for the Skitarii Tech-Guard. Those deemed unworthy or irredeemable are fated to be "recycled" into servitor components, and indeed, servitors and drones often far outnumber a forge world's freewilled population. Such is the price of failure.

Despite their mechanistic society and ceaseless industry, the life for the average citizen on a forge world is little harsher than on most hive worlds. Each forge world, regardless of its rigidly enforced order and the cold reason of its masters, is still home to very human ambition and apathy, vice and virtue. Indeed, the Mechanicus, with their cogitator-enhanced minds and iron logic, are still prone to factionalism and schism, often for reasons and causes quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Rivalries and feuds simmer betweens sects and individual Magos, each with their own devices and desires.

By far the largest and most important Mechanicus domains are the great forge worlds, such as the Lathe worlds of Calixis. This character Origin also covers those born and raised on the city-sized orbital stations, Mechanicus administered colonies (often called demesnes), research outposts and even in the forces of the restless explorator fleets, for the rites, rituals and beliefs of the Omnissiah also govern these places.

#### **Forge Born PCs**

Forge worlds are not environments that reward, let alone tolerate, weakness in body or in mind. To have survived and prospered enough to leave a forge world's rigid society, your character must possess a great deal of drive, ambition and good fortune, or at the very least be bloody-minded and ruthless enough to have endured. You find yourself in a wider Imperial society that is at once familiar and strangely alien to you, where fools baulk in superstition at technology without understanding its spiritual mysteries and purity of essence. Nor do they seem to understand mankind's survival demands power and, as the Omnissiah teaches, power is knowledge incarnate.

Common Lore (Tech) (Int) and Common Lore (Machine Cult) (Int) are Basic Skills for you.

#### **Forge World Traits**

The children of the Omnissiah's domains gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Fit For Purpose**

A forge world inhabitant is repeatedly tested, channelled and trained from birth for their chosen station and role in life. Weakness is not tolerated and failure met with painful incentives to do better. Even those who follow a rogue's path must strive to be better than their peers to survive.

**Effect:** Depending on your chosen Career, increase your Characteristic by +3: Adept—Intelligence, Assassin— Agility, Guardsman—Ballistic Skill, Scum—Perception, or Tech-Priest—Willpower.

#### **Stranger to the Cult**

Although forge world born citizens know that the Emperor is their god and saviour, they see the Imperial Creed through the lens of Cult Mechanicus doctrine. As a result, they can be surprisingly—and sometimes dangerously—ignorant of the common teachings and practices of the Ecclesiarchy, often failing to offer its clerics the level of deference they expect.

**Effect:** Forge world characters take a –10 penalty on Tests

involving knowledge of the Imperial Creed, and a –5 penalty on Fellowship Tests to interact with members of the Ecclesiarchy in formal settings.

#### **Credo Omnissiah**

Rather than being fully indoctrinated into the Imperial Cult, even the lowliest member of a forge world's society is brought up to venerate the spirits of the machine and to know and trust the basic rites of tech-propitiation.

**Effect:** You gain the Technical Knock talent.

#### **Starting Wounds**

Forge world characters start with d5+7 Wounds.

#### **Fate Points**

Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–5, you begin with 1 Fate Point; on a 6–9, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on a 10, you begin with 3 Fate Points.

#### **The Past—Point of Origin**

Although the rites, beliefs and society of the Adeptus Mechanicus remain remarkably constant, not all characters are born in the same circumstances. Table 1-2: Point of Origin illustrates some possible points of origin and how they might affect your outlook.

#### **Forge World Careers**

#### **Forge World Adepts**

Forge world Adepts toil among the gathered wisdom and incomprehensible minutia of the ages. Some consider themselves to be holy priests of knowledge, while for others the temptation to simply "know" becomes too much. For such driven and zealous individuals, data and its acquisition can become an addiction as dangerous and urgent as any drug, leading them to overstep the safe boundaries of ritual and clearance in search of ever more secret and obscure lore to the peril of life, sanity and soul.

#### **Forge World Assassins**

Subtle murder and infiltration are arts far from unknown in forge world politics. Bitter rivalries between individual Magos, demesne guild houses and opposing tech-sects can sometimes lead to outright data-theft, sabotage and bloodshed. The answer for some factions is to train and augment agents able to fulfil the roles of spy, saboteur and killer, and a few even sell their services for hire off-world.

#### **Forge World Guardsmen**

The regular armed forces of the Cult Mechanicus are the Skitarii Tech-Guard, raised as other worlds might form PDF units or regiments of the Imperial Guard. Selected and relentlessly trained to defend and enforce order on the forge worlds. Most will be part of a forge world's standing defences or law enforcement, while others may serve in the retinues of individual Magos or allied guild houses.

#### **Forge World Scum**

Most forge world Scum are classed as hereteks. A hidden underclass in the worker's slum-habs and abandoned buildings, they take what scraps of tech-lore they have managed to learn or steal and turn it to their own profit, often manufacturing illegal goods, drugs and arms from materials stolen from their erstwhile masters. All know that to be apprehended by the Mechanicus for their crimes often means a fate worse than death.

#### **Forge World Tech-Priests**

To be a tech-priest in a forge world is both a boon and a curse; it is to have access to the Machine God's greater glories but at the same time to be merely one among many; to be the least and most easily replaceable of the Omnissiah's servants. The society of tech-priests has a tendency to breed two polar groups; those who serve blindly and diligently and those who strive to overcome and advance themselves at any cost. For this latter division, flesh is merely weakness to be rid of, knowledge and power things to be coldly craved if the Machine God's mysteries are to be revealed and embraced.

#### <span id="page-11-0"></span>Table 1–2: Point of Origin  **Roll Result**

**(D100)**

- 01–30 **Greater Forge World:** Your character was raised in the shadows of one of the vast and powerful greater forges, such as the Lathe worlds of Calixis. You have felt the earth shake with the footfalls of Titans and basked in the fire-glow of kilometre-wide molten metal crucibles. Few spectacles impress you and the superiority of the Machine God is as evident in your mind as it is absolute.
- 31–47 **Minor Forge World:** You were born and trained on a minor forge world, either one yet to gain its majority or one where conditions were either particularly adverse or threatened. Hard experience has taught you the value of duty, unity and obedience and that the work of many is far harder to destroy than the work of one.
- 48–61 **Orbital:** You hail from one of the Mechanicus's city-sized orbital stations and are accustomed to the miracles of contragravity, power fields and the mysteries of circuit and plasma. Each orbital serves a specialised task such as weaponsmithing or crystal promulgation, and you value purity of purpose and mastery of skill above all else.
- 62–74 **Demesne:** A child of one of the Mechanicus's dominion worlds, you were singled-out and selected from your people at an early age for your potential and launched upon the path the Omnissiah has chosen for you. You have faith in your destiny and ability to overcome whatever is set against you; the weak perish and the superior survive.
- 75–89 **Research Outpost:** You spent your formative years serving on an isolated outpost scattered amongst the cold and unforgiving stars. You value single-minded pursuit of a goal above other considerations and you see dependence on the company of others as a weakness.
- 90–00 **Explorator Fleet:** Assigned at a young age to the forces of an Explorator Magos, you have travelled to distant and unknown stars and set foot upon worlds aeons dead. You have seen wonders and horrors few even suspect exist. Your encounters have left you craving always to know more, witness more and rip open the galaxy's secrets, one xenos body at a time if need be.

#### **Mind Cleansed**

*"I awoke in a bare, steel cell and knew not who I was. I asked the crimson-clad guards who took me, but they would not answer, nor would the chanting priest, the empty-eyed psyker or even the terrible lord in his gilded armour. Then my master placed a blade in my hand and I knew who I was, I was the Emperor's servant; I was death."*

— Sister Fayde, Sanctioned Inhumatrix.

There are things too dangerous to know, lives too heinous to continue and there are memories too terrible to bear, even for the strongest mind. In most of these cases, the answer as far as the Inquisition is concerned is simple: death, be it a well-deserved execution or the blessing of the Emperor's peace. But for a small number, a different solution is found—mental cleansing, a laborious and involved process sometimes known as mind-scrubbing or the "death of self ". Through a combination of psycho-viral, mimetic and telepathic intervention, the subject's memories are selectively erased and thought patterns altered. The resulting individual is then something of a blank slate to be rewritten, and in extreme cases entire new personalities and skills are imprinted directly into the mind.

The mind cleansed are effectively reborn and remade in the image of the Inquisition's desire, complete with whatever implanted skills or personality traits are required, perhaps along with a reconditioned physique and a new face to go with it. They may also (completely unbeknownst to them) be programmed with implanted memories of events and people that never were, or with deep-rooted mental commands they have no choice but to obey when the time comes.

This process, however, is not without cost or risk. Mind cleansed individuals are often left hollow and isolated figures, distrusted and forever set apart from others. Their patchwork memories and abused minds often leave them lacking empathy, cold-hearted and filled with a sense of loss or unnameable dread. Worse still in rare cases, some fragments of the old self or memories reassert themselves over time, causing a breakdown into madness or warranting further drastic "action" on the part of their masters.

A mind cleansed character has been kept alive for a reason, although they may not know and may never be told just what that reason is. They might have been selected by shear dint of survival, having endured terrible events or knowledge, and the Holy Ordos might have decided they were too useful to be wasted. Likewise, they might have been a loyal servant in the past or even an innocent victim or bystander of some horror, event or conspiracy that must remain secret. There may be darker motives though; perhaps the Inquisition has some use or hidden purpose for the individual that makes it expedient to keep them alive… for now.

#### **Mind Cleansed PCs**

One day you awoke having been remade at the whim of another. Your mind is little more than a house filled with locked rooms that you cannot enter, and there are a thousand questions about yourself that you simply cannot answer. You cannot remember how you acquired or where you learned the knowledge and skills you possess. Sometimes you are shocked by the things you can do. You have a yawning emptiness inside you where others have memories of their past and, as a result, you feel separated from those around you, cast adrift in social situations as if they are happening to somebody else. The Inquisition's service is all you know, but you also know they do not really trust you—why should they? After all you don't trust yourself; for all you know you were once the very kind of monster you now hunt. The shadow in your mind is always there, lurking at the back of your mind, shapeless and formless, visible with horrible clarity for that split second when you awake screaming, only to melt away again to nothingness, like sand through your fingers.

#### **Mind Cleansed Traits**

Thanks to their unique nature Mind Cleansed characters gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Engram Implantation**

With portions of the subjects' minds left more or less as blank slates waiting to be filled, their reprogrammers often use egramatic induction to burn a variety of useful skill patterns directly into the Acolyte's cortex.

**Effect:** You begin play with Deceive (Fel) and Intimidate (S) skills. You treat Common Lore (Tech) (Int) and Survival (Int) as Basic Skills. You also begin with the Jaded and Pistol Weapon Training (SP and Las) talents.

#### **Failsafe Control**

All Mind Cleansed Inquisitorial agents have a failsafe command trigger implanted in their minds to prevent

#### **Mind Cleansed Careers**

Mind Cleansed characters may take any of the following Career Paths:

#### **Cleansed Arbitrators**

The Adeptus Arbites and local enforcers may well, during the course of their sworn duties, uncover truths too terrible to understand and see things that no man may live through sane. The Inquisition, for its part, sees such unfortunates as prime candidates for mind cleansing and induction into their ranks, burning away what cannot be allowed to remain and leaving a lifetime of training and an ingrained sense of duty.

#### **Cleansed Assassins**

The cleansed assassin is usually little more than a living weapon in the hands of the Holy Ordos, a near disposable tool of death, reprogrammed to serve without question and kill without conscience. They make for able bodyguards and infiltrators, and indeed some may once have been mercenaries, recidivists or other scum that have been captured, cleansed and turned on their former friends.

#### **Cleansed Clerics**

Clerics are among the rarest of cleansed Acolytes, as martyrdom in most cases is deemed preferable for a true servant of the faith than mind scrubbing. Exceptions do exist, however, and the cleansing may leave a cleric shorn away of their past and memories, leaving only fervour and the love of the Emperor behind. Some Radical Inquisitors, with a sense of ironic punishment, may order a heretic or criminal to be remade as a faithful servant of the Emperor to pay for their sins with a lifetime of service. This is frowned on by many traditionalists as an unjustly lenient punishment, added to which, as past events have proven on more than one occasion, as evil may remain in even the most "scrubbed" soul.

#### **Cleansed Guardsman**

The Inquisition has frequent use for inducted military forces when a major raid or suppression is called for. However, it is often necessary that the men and woman involved cannot be allowed to remember what they have done or seen in the Holy Ordos' service. If the risk of corruption is too great, death is the only answer, but if possible, a particularly able servant of the Emperor should not be wasted when they have more left to give.

#### **Cleansed Psykers**

Psykers are prey to all manner of horrors from the warp and frequently prone to mental disorders and trauma, particularly if their abilities have emerged or been discovered late in life. Sometimes where this is the case, the powers-that-be judge that the psyker's talent can be salvaged, but that "who they are" has become irretrievably damaged. The answer for some is to cut away the personality and memories like a surgeon might cut away cancerous tissue from a healthy organ, but as with surgery, the results cannot always be guaranteed.

#### **Cleansed Tech-Priests**

The Adeptus Mechanicus knows that knowledge can be dangerous. The cerebral augmentation of a tech-priest can make the selective destruction of memory easier in fact than with a normal brain. A cleansed tech-priest may have served as part of some secret project or mission that, once complete, merited the wiping of all trace of its knowledge for those involved as a matter of course. Alternately, they may have followed some renegade master, become prey to tech-heresy themselves or simply strayed too far into regions forbidden. Some tech-priests even see mind cleansing as a desirable procedure, ridding them of the weakness of a sentimental attachment to the past.

them from turning on their masters. Only the relevant NPC (their Inquisitor for example), should ever have access to this trigger, which usually must be delivered telepathically or by a specific sonic cadence (a simple code phrase is usually judged too risky).

**Effect:** The trigger works just like the use of the Dominate Psychic Power (see page 178 in Dark Heresy). If the trigger is successful, you may be given an order or set of instructions you must carry out to the best of your abilities. However, if the command is antithetical or directly harmful to you, you may receive an appropriate bonus to resist the control.

#### **Imperial Conditioning**

Inquisition mind-scrubs are usually carried out to destroy selective memories but leave useful skills intact. Likewise the mind is often implanted with psychic barriers to prevent tampering, increase mental resilience and ensure loyalty.

**Effect:** You gain a +10 bonus on Willpower Tests made to resist Fear or attempts to control or possess your mind (psychically, chemically or otherwise).

#### **Through A Mirror Darkly**

The mind cleansing process has numerous side effects, including an eroding effect on the subject's sanity and unique dangers of its own for the character.

**Effect:** You start play with 1d5+2 Insanity Points. At the GMs discretion, certain rare events, individuals and even things like phrases, sights, and smells may trigger "repressed" memories roll on Table 1-3: Shards of Memory. When this occurs you must pass a Willpower Test or roll on the Shock Table (see page 233 in Dark Heresy)—note that your conditioning and any Talents that resist Fear or Insanity don't help with this. **GM Note:** Use this Trait sparingly.

#### **Starting Wounds**

Cleansed characters start the game with d5+8 Wounds.

#### **Starting Fate Points**

Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–3, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on a 4–9, you begin with 3 Fate Points; on a 10 you begin with 4 Fate Points.

#### **Shards of Memory**

Despite the best efforts of their mental conditioning, strange and disturbing flashes of the past may creep through, materialising in frozen dislocated images in dreams, sudden déjà-vu or inexplicable fears and revulsions that pass in a flickering panicked moment. Table 1-3: Shards of Memory presents a few possible examples (GMs may feel inclined to provide further "episodes").

Noble Born

Table 1–3: Shards of Memory

 **Roll Result**

**(d100)**

- 01–22 **The Shattered Mirror:** Sensations fill your mind—a vision of a partner and a child, a snatch of a melody, the smell of food cooking, a house, sudden barbs of emotion that flee before they can be grasped. Are they your lost family or maybe your victims?
- 23–34 **The Cold Grave:** Stillness, silence, smothering darkness and utter cold. Cold enough to freeze the soul and burn the mind. Death—you're sure it was; death had claimed you till they brought you back and it waits for you every waking moment, lurking just at the edge of sight, waiting to claim you again.
- 35–40 **The Night of the Daemon:** The fire and shadow, the vast terrifying shape of that terrible horned thing looming at the heart of the dark storm, laughing and calling a name you can't quite make out your true name? Only the Daemon knows.
- 41–52 **The Sole Survivor:** The steel walls are stained with blood, the blood of your friends and comrades. You can hear their screams still as if they were frozen in the air. You wander long corridors empty but for the memory of death, alone, the last survivor envying the dead.
- 53–61 **The Dark Altar:** The ceremony has begun and the awful chanting from robed figures erodes your mind as they move in spirals of night around the dark altar. Your cause is just and your faith unshakable, but you know that however many of the heretics you kill, the terrible chanting burning in your brain won't stop; won't ever stop…
- 62–71 **The Throne of Blood:** You stand triumphant, your followers' heads bow as you pass, their life and death yours to command, yours by right. Then abruptly all is chaos and ruin, fire and blood. You are shackled and broken, dark figures drag you away, but that sweet taste of powers lingers a moment yet.
- 72–80 **The Nightmare Forest:** You are lost and terrified in the alien landscape. Trees of black glass sing with unnatural voices as the blood-hot wind stirs them. You stumble aimlessly and panicked through the bloated corpse-white loam—it follows you, stalking you. You keep catching glimpses of its foul bulk floating between the jagged black trees, it is working its way closer, slowly moving in and when you see it, you know you will simply go mad.
- 81–95 **The Malfian Candidate:** You look down on the opulent assembly from on high; lords and ladies, adepts and priests, glittering with wealth and satiated with power. The greatest among them steps forward and the fawning worthies part as he glides by in stately progress. You raise the weapon to your shoulder and centre the optic sight on his patrician countenance and your finger tightens on the trigger.
- 96–00 **The Repairer of Reputations:** You sit begging the strange man in his dim parlour. Only he can help, you plead. It's gone too far, you can't stop it, you're a heartbeat from discovery and if they find you, you'll lose everything. The kindly old man, with eyes like dead stars, smiles slyly as you plead on your knees before him, and the shadows cast by the burning coals behind him are not of a man at all.

# I: Advanced Character Creation

#### <span id="page-15-0"></span>**Noble Born** Noble Born

*"Some things can be taught, others acquired by simple exchange of coin. What is truly important, though, is carried in the blood."*

— Viola Del Sheen, Matriarch of the Del Sheen.

The high nobility of the Imperium forms the wealthiest and most powerful elite. A breed apart from those they rule. Many noble houses span the stars in an intricate web of kinship, marriage and political alliances that ensure their power and influence go on, even if the fortunes of a single world fail. Products of careful breeding and cultured refinement over centuries (or even millennia), the lineage they hold in their blood is the history of the Imperium itself and they are the finest that humanity has to offer—or so they would have you believe at any rate. Nobility of birth has never been a guarantee of character unfortunately, for every example of true enlightenment or greatness there are dozens of capricious and self-obsessed men and women who prove, by their base failings, that measuring superiority by birth alone in the Imperium is a lie. Worse still than the dissolute idlers and petty tyrants are those whose dark inclinations spill over into heresy and true malignancy, often for no better reason than boredom or a sadistic love of power. It is this last supremely dangerous group that the Inquisition watches for, and combating such powerful and well-resourced heretics is one reason the Holy Ordos draws from the nobility's own ranks to find some of its servants.

From almost their first breath, those born to the high nobility are schooled in the role they must play and how they must play it. Their fine education covers not only the ins and outs of history, commerce and power-politics, but an education in the fine-points of taste and etiquette: how to wear a mask of one's own choosing, how to give an intended slight, how to curry and mete favour, the defence of honour and how to comport oneself in all situations are all lessons deeply ingrained. In some great families, these arts have darker nuances yet; the correct use of poison, a well-executed betrayal and the employment of assassins, all being among them.

Connected, socially skilled, highly educated and able to move in the high circles of Imperial society, those of noble blood are frequently as ruthless as they are charming and as dangerous as they are well mannered, making for skilled infiltrators and subtle Acolytes.

#### **Noble Born PCs**

You were born into wealth and privilege, educated by tutors, and tempered by spiteful intrigues. You know how to move in the high circles of Imperial society and how to bend others to your will, and you have never been touched by the harsh life the common citizens must endure. You may be a honourable and faithful soul, well aware of the duties your station imposes on you, or a dissolute rakehell who cares naught for those unfortunate enough to be low born. Either way, the Holy Ordos has taken an interest in you, and you acknowledge that it has a greater power than any your family have ever wielded.

#### **Noble Born Skills**

You begin play with Literacy (Int), Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int), and Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int).

#### **Noble Born Traits**

Noble born gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Etiquette**

Nobles are schooled in how to comport themselves in all manner of formal situations.

**Effect:** You gain a +10 bonus on Charm, Deceive and Scrutiny Tests when dealing with high authority and in formal situations.

#### **Noble Born Careers**

Characters of Noble Birth may take any of the following Career Paths:

#### **Noble Born Adepts**

There are many nobles, particularly those distant from power, who turn their educated minds and fortunes to intellectual pursuits and embark on self-financed careers acquiring obscure knowledge and cataloguing esoteric subjects, though their curiosity can and often does lead them to trouble.

#### **Noble Born Arbitrator**

A noble house's holdings can be extremely large and its enemies many, and the protection of the house entrusted only to castellans of the same blood. Others of noble blood enter the Arbites as a means to find a purpose, or to increase their own influence and power.

#### **Noble Born Assassins**

The nobility of the Imperium is riven with vendettas and bloody power struggles, and through these delicate wars move the noble Assassins, versed in the etiquette and form of killing; to them assassination is a dance to be executed with precision and, in some cases, relish.

#### **Noble Born Clerics**

The Ecclesiarchy is a high and noble calling as well as being a route to one of the greatest powers in the Imperium: faith. Most noble families have confessors from within their own blood, and some have a few prelates or even cardinals to boot. Imperial history is filled with those of noble birth who have ascended to greatness in the priesthood for good or ill, carried by their noble bearing, flattery and skilled diplomacy.

#### **Noble Born Guardsmen**

Many noble families have traditions of service within the officer class of the Imperial Guard, either as a life-long career or a staging post to greater things. In many cases, young nobles are sent to serve with regiments raised by the family itself, before returning blooded and swelled with glory to serve their family. That is presuming they return at all.

#### **Noble Born Scum**

A noble birth is no guarantee of a noble soul, and the refinement and mannered charm of good breeding can be turned to less than honest pursuits. Murderous rakes and dandy charlatans fallen from great houses, and concealed "embarrassments" that others might label monsters, are more common than the nobility would like others to believe.

#### **Supremely Connected**

Nobles have extensive connections and you know that dropping the "right" names into a conversation can open more doors than a fistful of Thrones.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Peer (Nobility) talent. In addition, you also gain Peer (Academics, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Government, Mercantile, Military or Underworld), selecting one category to reflect your family's powerbase.

#### **Vendetta**

Every noble house has its sworn enemies and rivals who would do it and its members harm. Joining the Holy Ordos doesn't stop this, it merely forces those who wish you harm to be a bit more cautious and subtle in exacting their vengeance.

**Effect:** You have powerful enemies, perhaps in the shape of a rival noble house or some other powerful group. The details of these enemies are left to you and the GM to define, working together to create a formidable threat. While they do not dog your steps at every turn, they are still out there, aiming to inconvenience, harm or kill you when you cross their path, You, of course, are free to return the favour when it's expedient to do so.

#### **Wealth**

Those born into the nobility are also born in to wealth and enjoy the fruits of their family's fortunes.

**Effect:** You begin play with double the starting number of Thrones. You are also Noble for the purposes of determining monthly income (see page 124 of Dark Heresy).

#### **Starting Wounds**

Noble Born characters start with d5+8 Wounds.

#### **Fate Points**

Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–3, you begin with 1 Fate Point; on a 4–9, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on a 10 you begin with 3 Fate Points.

#### **The Past — Lineage o f Renown**

Noble houses are each built on different traditions and each has a unique foundation to their position and power. These origins have a huge impact on one born into a noble family. You may roll on Table 1-4: Lineage of Renown to determine your family's traditions.

#### Table 1–4: Lineage of Reknown  **Roll Result (D100)**

- 01–15 **Merchant Magnates:** Your family controls vast trading operations throughout the sector and beyond. The accumulation of wealth and power through trade requires all scions of the house to have a quick head for business or find themselves marginalised.
- 16–30 **Family Militant:** Your house was built by the blood of your forebears who were the heroes of past wars. The family has strong ties with the military wings of the Imperium, and its traditions are bound to those of warrior honour and glory.
- 31–45 **Commanders of Mankind:** Your family is among the hereditary rulers of your world. Your house is among the finest, most powerful and trusted of all noble families, but with enemies to match.
- 46–60 **Provender of the Imperium:** Your house is built on vast holdings which produce the raw materials on which the Imperium depends, be it ore or grain, though you yourself are far removed from such dirty work.
- 61–75 **House of the Iron Spires:** You come from one of the high noble houses of a hive world. The fortunes of your house are built on the labour of the multitudes that toil far beneath your family's spire-top manses.
- 76–85 **The Blood of Greatness:** One of your ancestors was a legendary figure in the Imperium. His or her deeds built your house in a single lifetime and it has endured on their labour and renown ever since.
- 86–95 **Rogue's Fortune:** Your family possesses an ancient Rogue Trader charter and their fortunes have been forged by boldness and daring in the darkness between distant stars. Although accepted by your noble peers, they might consider your clan eccentric or dangerous, and not without reason.
- 96–00 **Shadowed Blood:** Your family are not what they seem. Some past disgrace, disaster or dishonour haunts the name of your house, and your family possesses but a shadow of its past glories. Your mansions are all but dusty ruins and your name whispered fearfully by those you command.

#### <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Schola Progenium** Schola Progenium

*"We are concerned with the future. The victory of mankind depends on those who lead and those who serve. That responsibility is ours; that future is ours to bring to pass."* — Abbot Bernar Skrayling, Maccabeus Quintus Schola Progenium.

The Schola Progenium takes children whose parents have perished in the service of the Emperor, from daughters of Imperial Guard Officers killed on the battlefield, to sons of administrators lost in the far reaches of the Imperial space, and trains them to become the backbone of Imperial society. Those who pass through the Schola Progenium are called progena, and they receive an education like no other. The fundamental part of life in the Schola Progenium is harsh discipline. From the day they first don their grey garb, the progena learn that the God-Emperor has no use for infirmity of purpose or weakness, and pain is merely and illusion of an untrained mind. Swift correction, prayer, fasting and contemplation are the tools by which a mind of rigid purpose and faith is formed, and the cornerstone of the Schola's teaching. A progena's education moves through predetermined phases, beginning with literacy and the Imperial Creed, and progressing on through history, politics, the contemplation of Imperial saints, rhetoric and leadership skills. The curriculum does not stop at honing the intellect either as all progena are trained in physical endurance and skill at arms by the infamous drill abbots. The drill abbots are hardened veterans and have usually spent half their lives in Imperial military service. Hard, unforgiving and relentless, the lessons imparted by the drill abbots will stay with progena for their entire lives.

As they mature, the progena are groomed for the place they shall take in the service of the Imperium. Many are taken into the Ecclesiarchy, Administratum or some other division of the Adeptus Terra, while others of martial leanings find their place in the officer cadres of the Imperial armed forces or Adeptus Arbites. The finest progena are recruited into the most specialised of the Imperium's elites, such as the Commissariat or Adeptus Sororitas, and a very few are inducted directly into the Inquisition.

#### **Schola Progenium PCs**

Progena are creations of the Imperium, trained to be unbending of will, decisive in action and quick of mind. To you, service in the Inquisition is a privilege and a duty to be discharged with all of your soul. There are no questions to be raised and no moral ambiguities to be pondered when it comes to the survival of mankind. You are well prepared to meet any challenge and show contempt for what others consider hardship.

#### **Schola Progenium Skills**

Schola Progenium characters are highly literate and well read. You begin play with Literacy (Int), Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int), and Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int).

#### **Progena Traits**

Progena gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Schola Education**

A progeny's mind is the product of years of careful instruction in the fundamentals of knowledge and learning.

**Effect:** Common Lore (Administratum) (Int), Common Lore (Ecclesiarchy) (Int), Common Lore (Imperial Creed) (Int), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Common Lore (War) (Int), and Scholastic Lore (Philosophy) (Int) are Basic Skills for you.

#### **Skill at Arms**

All progena are instructed by grizzled drill abbots in the arts needed to defend the Emperor's truth and, no matter what their calling, all are willing and able to shed blood if needed.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Basic Weapon Training (Las or SP), Melee Weapon Training (Primitive), and Pistol Training (Las or SP) talents.

#### **Schola Progenium Careers**

Characters from the Schola Progenium may take any of the following Career Paths:

#### **Schola Progenium Adepts**

Adepts recruited out of the Schola Progenium are often destined for special duties in the Administratum or in scholastic colleges specialising in particular or difficult areas of knowledge. Such dedicated and hard-willed individuals may find their way to being researchers or archivists serving the Adeptus Arbites, Munitorium or even the Black Ships of the Inquisition.

#### **Schola Progenium Arbitrators**

Many of the finest Arbites are drawn from the Progenium, where their unstinting loyalty to the Imperial Creed and detachment from local society makes them ideal lawgivers and dispensers of justice. Often frontline command or high office beckons for progena, but some also find their intellects put to use in special investigation units. The obscure and secretive Inquisitorial Wards draw a high proportion of their number from the Schola Progenium output.

#### **Schola Progenium Clerics**

Products of the Schola are found in all ranks and divisions of the Ecclesiarchy, from the Missionary Galaxia to the parish deacons who maintain the many temporal holdings of the Ministorum. Hardened and educated in the Imperial Creed from an early age, becoming a preacher, confessor or missionary is but a small step for a progena.

#### **Schola Progenium Guardsmen**

The harsh mental and physical discipline of the Schola produces fine material for soldiering. Famously, the storm troopers of the Imperial Guard are almost exclusively drawn from the Schola Progenium, while the Commissariat and Divisio Tactica also sport high number of former progena students.

#### **Schola Progenium Sororitas**

Female progena make up the overwhelming majority of the Adeptus Sororitas. The Schola's spiritual, physical and mental training are the perfect prelude to noviceship in one of the Orders.

#### **Sheltered Upbringing**

Despite their extremely well-rounded education, the progena are largely ignorant of the Imperium's worse elements, breeding a distain they can't ever seem to manage to hide.

**Effect:** You take a –10 penalty on all Charm, Command, Deceive and Scrutiny Tests when dealing with the worst of examples of humanity (cultists, traitors, narco-addicts, gutter scum, mutants and the like).

#### **Tempered Will**

The harsh methods of the Schola Progenium chiefly aim to forge the most crucial weapon a servant of the Emperor has: an unbending will.

**Effect:** Whenever you would attempt a Very Hard (–30) Willpower Test, you only take a –20 penalty for your Characteristic instead of the normal –30.

#### **Starting Wounds**

Progena characters start with d5+8 Wounds.

#### **Fate Points**

Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–2, you begin with 1 Fate Point; on a 3–7, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on an 8–10 you begin with 3 Fate Points.

#### <span id="page-20-0"></span>**The Past: Orphan**

The Schola aims to form their young charges into perfect servants of the Emperor without unnecessary emotion or individualism. All progena, however, are born of Imperial servants, and the death of their parents is one of the few ties with the past that progena are allowed to have. You may roll on Table 1-5: Family's Fate to determine who your parents were and how they died.

#### Table 1–5: Family's Fate  **Roll Result**

- **(D100)**
- 01–25 **Warrior Martyr:** Your parents were members of the Imperial Guard and perished at the hands of the enemies of mankind.
- 26–45 **Slaughtered by Rebels:** Your parents were Imperial loyalists caught in a rebellion that brutally claimed their lives.
- 46–65 **Distant Outpost:** Your parents were posted to a distant and lonely outpost, so remote communication could never again be made in your life time.
- 66–75 **Lost to the Void:** Your parents were devoted servants of the Adeptus Terra and disappeared along with the ship they travelled on.
- 76–85 **Without a Trace:** There are no records of what happened to your parents, though you know who they were; at some point, they simply vanished from all records.
- 86–95 **Never to Return:** Your parents were attached to an Imperial crusade or Rogue Trader expedition that ventured far beyond Imperial space and has never returned.
- 96–00 **Not Spoken Of:** No one will talk of your parents or your family. You have no idea how they died or who they were; all enquires about them are met with stony silence.

**"If I have strayed from the path of obedience it is only to follow the most sacred of all directions, those of the Emperor himself, for is it not written in the Book of the Astronomican. 'A true servant follows his Master if he listens to the heart and not the head."**

### GENERATING CHARACTERISTICS Ge n erating Characteristics

#### <span id="page-21-0"></span>Unique Worlds of the Calixis Sector Un iq ue Worlds of the Calixis Sector

*"Here is the tread of would-be gods and slain saints. Here is the mark of the darkness yet to come. Here creeps the crown of ancient slaughter yet unborn. Here is the fate of all. All writ amongst these cold stars."*

— Attributed to Erasmus Haarlock, Rogue Trader.

The Character Creation chapter in Dark Heresy and the extra Origins presented earlier in this book cover a huge range of possible life histories and backgrounds for your Player Characters, but the Calixis Sector, (let alone the Imperium) is a vast and diverse place filled with wonders and terrors uncounted. The following section details several unique and often infamous worlds and Origins that can be found within the Calixis Sector and shows the often extreme effects they can have on a character's nature and abilities.

In order to create a character using one of these worlds, use the Home World section of the character creation process as normal but apply the modifications as detailed in the unique home world entry that follows. This usually means swapping out one or more of the home world's usual Traits for those listed in the specific world entry. In the case of granted Talents, disregard the prerequisites, as they are "bred" rather than developed through training. Obviously, you also do not need to roll to determine what type of world you are from.

Example: Sara has rolled Hive World as a starting Home World for her character. Having had a look at the unique Home Worlds, she decides that her character is from Volg, the nastiest hive going. She applies the modifers as shown in the Volg entry, swapping the usual hive world trait Wary for the Born Survivor, and Grim traits, which are added to her character along with the remaining traits listed in the hive world entry (Accustomed to Crowds, Caves of Steel, and Hivebound). With these five Traits and their effects noted, she carries on with character generation as normal.

#### **Battlefleet Calixis (Void Born)** Battlefleet Calixis (Void Born)

The men and women of the Imperial Navy's officer class are a breed apart even from other void born. A cornerstone of the Imperium's war machine, they descend from a long and noble line of naval families and warship clans that trace their history of service back millennia into the Imperium's distant past. Many have links to the ruling classes of worlds that administer the battlefleet's ships, where their house and their families are emboldened with grandeur taken from the spoils of war. They are a proud and martially-minded people with a strong sense of personal honour. They respect duty, loyalty and strength of character and despise weakness, inconstancy and deceit. Many

are notably much more powerfully built than the void born of trade or chartist vessels, and thanks to their reputation as mankind's shield, they are far better respected, though often seem to lack the void born's legendary good fortune.

The ships of Battlefleet Calixis are widely dispersed across the sector; some maintain the trade routes and welltravelled courses of the great chartist vessels, while others patrol the danger zones of the Adrantis Nebula and the Hazeroth Abyss where dark forces lurk still. But their most unpredictable and dangerous task is to guard the border of the Halo Stars, beyond which horrors uncounted and unknown lurk beyond the reach of Imperial space.

#### **Battlefleet Calixis PCs**

Characters from a Battlefleet Calixis grand lineage come from a long tradition of heroic sacrifice, adventure and bravery. For generations, it has been their families' sacred duty to keep the Imperium together and functioning by protecting its worlds from aggression and keeping the trade and communication lanes open, and they demand the respect that is their due. Regardless of whether they have followed their kin into direct military service or not, they have a tendency to be loud, confident and brash, but with the skills and mettle to back it up.

#### **Creating Characters from the Imperial Navy**

In order to create characters with an Imperial Navy lineage, use the Void Born template but replace the Charmed and Ill-Omened traits with those described here.

#### **Naval Lineage Skills**

You begin play with the Speak Language (Battlefleet War Cant) (Int) and you treat Common Lore (Tech) (Int) as a Basic Skill.

#### **Close-Quarter Fighter**

The business of the Navy is war, both in the cold void of space between vessels, and in murderous close-quarter boarding actions aboard them, battles for which you have been trained from childhood.

**Effect:** Increase you starting Strength by +5. You also begin play with the Basic Weapon Training (SP) talent. In addition, when engaged in melee combat with your back to a solid wall or in a confined space, such as a narrow corridor, you gain a +5 bonus on Weapon Skill Tests.

However, you are unaccustomed to fighting "dirtside" and you take a –1 penalty on Initiative rolls when fighting outdoors on a planet's surface. Also, you take an additional –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests when firing a weapon at Long Range or greater.

#### **Officer on Deck**

On a warship, orders are obeyed swiftly and to the letter or people die. The Naval bloodlines are used to bellowing orders and having them carried out, regardless of their actual status in life.

Effect: You gain a +10 bonus on all Command Tests while aboard a star vessel. You also gain a +5 bonus on all Fellowship Tests made to interact with Void Born.

#### <span id="page-22-0"></span>**Dusk (Feral World)** Dusk(Feral World)

*"Gods of the warp strike me down if I ever return to that place. Oh we landed hard and well armed; a score of us—killjacks and pirates every one. We took the cutter down to where the tip-off said the deal was happening… empty, nothing but rotten shacks… nothing! Then that devil fog rolled in and all hell broke loose. I made it out running blind—the screams and the laugher and the awful mocking things all around me! Could have been days, could have been hours, I don't know… it was the old hag that dragged me out of the fog, and my left eye she took in payment, but at least I was gone from that haunted place!"*

— The Heretic "Captain" Gadred Bayle, *Interrogation Testimony Vol. 17*.

The world of Dusk is a legendarily dangerous and ill-omened planet on the very edge of the Halo Stars, famed both for the lethality of its wildlife and for the many nightmarish legends and baleful tales clustering around the world like moths to a flame. Dusk is a place of trackless fens, mist-drenched forests, and moss-shrouded wooded swamps—a prime candidate for conversion to mass agriculture, (particularly as its distant locale might allow for further exploitation of the region). Attempt after attempt has been made to colonise Dusk since the days of Angevin's crusade; each has met with disaster, suffering and death, making the world's very name synonymous with ill-omen, sinister mystery and folly.

Dusk's fecund nature is also its curse. Its teaming wetlands breed all manner of fevers, parasites and other morbidities, while its forests and swamps are home to some of the most deadly indigenous life forms in the sector; while moss, fast-growing plant-life, mildew and rot quickly claim any abandoned structure. Worse still, as any psyker or seer will tell you upon setting foot on the world, it is a place where the veil between realspace and the immaterium—between the waking world and nightmare—is very thin indeed.

No accurate census has ever been taken of Dusk's population, and the planet's inhabitants have been formed from a melting pot of colonial survivors, outcasts and wanderers scattered among isolated villages and plantations, where oil lamps and black powder guns are all they have to keep the dark at bay. The Dusk born are insular and superstitious to a degree rarely seen even in the Imperium. Feuding, sudden madness, strange phenomena, mysterious disappearances—all are accepted facts of daily life. The rate of psyker births among the population of the planet is also known to be comparably high, and the people of Dusk have come under Ecclesiarchy and Inquisitorial suspicion for descending into the worship of strange cults and creeds in the past, and several purges have been carried out down the years with visits by the Black Ships comparably frequent despite the world's distant locale. But for all of this, Dusk yet endures, and for those few willing to risk the journey and the dangers of the world itself, Dusk's fecund wildlife and fauna hold great worth in trade both legal and proscribed, and it is these off-worlders that have ensured Dusk's ongoing place as a world of dark repute in the minds of the wider sector.

Fundamentally, Dusk is a world caught on the edge and its inhabitants caught on the brink with it: the edge of known space, the edge of savagery, the edge of sanity and the edge of the endless abyss of the warp.

#### **Dusk Born PCs**

The people of Dusk are unsurprisingly well versed in both survival and dark lore from the cradle, and to look into the eyes of the Dusk born is to meet the gaze of someone who has seen terrors most hardened war zone veterans would shrink from. Although often withdrawn, menacing and with a macabre humour, they make for excellent Inquisitorial Acolytes, well-armed by bitter experience against the nature of the perils they must face.

#### **Creating Characters from Dusk**

Use the Feral World Home World template, replacing the Iron Stomach and Rite of Passage traits with those presented here:

#### **Dusk Native Skills**

You begin play with the Speak Language (Dusk Cant) (Int) skill.

#### **Bad Blood**

The Dusk born are an ill-omened people, considered by most to be accursed by the simple fact of their birth world. Truth be told, there is some credence to this belief as trauma, madness, supernatural occurrences and morbid eccentricity are all common currency on Dusk as accepted facts of life.

**Effect:** Dusk characters begin the game with 1d5 Insanity points and 1d5 Corruption points. They also benefit from a +3 increase to both their Perception and Willpower Characteristics.

#### **Dark Tales**

One key way of learning to survive for a child on Dusk is to pay heed to the many strange tales and nightmarish stories told by the fireside when the storms howl or the dank fogs press close, and the stories of Dusk hold many dark truths and shadowed pearls of wisdom.

**Effect:** You start the game with Common Lore (Dusk Folklore) (Int). In addition, you treat Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) (Int) and Scholastic Lore (Occult) (Int) as Basic Skills.

#### **Little Left to Fear**

While other worlds may indeed host worse perils than Dusk, the dangers encountered there are of a singularly macabre and often horrific kind, and after a lifetime spent surviving them, the bestial predators and weird happenings of other worlds hold little terror.

**Effect:** You reduce the effects of Fear on your character by one degree (reducing Fear 3 to Fear 2, etc.) Essentially this also means that you suffer no effects from creatures or phenomena with a Fear Rating of 1. Since your life has been full of near-scrapes with things best left unsaid, you also reduce your starting number of Fate Points by –1.

# I: Advanced Character Creation

#### <span id="page-23-0"></span>**Gunmetal City— Scintilla (Hive World)** Gunmetal City\_ Scintilla(Hive World)

*"Welcome lords and ladies, saints and sinners, young and old, child and grandsire! Welcome to the thunder of the guns, the trail of life, the judgment of the swift and the dead! Welcome to the Sands of Blood: the greatest show in Gunmetal City! Just a few more minutes and you'll see the bullets fly!"*

— The Crooked Man, Master of Ceremonies at the Sands of Blood.

Ringing the crater of Mount Thollos is the hot metal and black powder scorched hive of Gunmetal City. Sustained by the output of its fanes and forges who produce billions of firearms in almost endless variation, Metallican society truly is built and ruled by the gun. Here power and loyalty are shifting, precarious things bartered, bribed and bled for between dozens of clans and guilds, fanes and mercenaries. From the families of the highest spires through the great bulk of the population that toil in the foundries and manufactora, right down to the infamous gun clans of the Infernis in the swelter of the underhive, the harsh roar of a gunshot settles all arguments, but rarely with any finality. Gunmetal City is an upstart hive, still young and growing from the wealth its lethal trade brings. It is a vibrant, bold, frenetic and dangerous place, a place where fortunes can be made and power grasped, if one has the luck, skill and courage to do so.

Beyond nerve and skill with a pistol, Metallican society respects only a person's oath and craftsmanship. No matter what their standing, all Metallicans understand and appreciate the craft of the gunsmith, able to admire the superb action of a Hecuter 9/5 and pour reasoned scorn upon a Volg zipper gun. Even the lowliest hab-worker knows how to shoot, even if they must lease their weapon from their employers and have never pulled the trigger in anger. The gun clans of the Infernis are another matter entirely; these warring gangs rule the scorching hot lower margins of the hive, and they are legendarily well-armed and willing to resort to lethal violence over the slightest provocation or cause. Hired killers bred in the baking heat and anarchic conflicts of the Infernis command a high price as mercenaries and bodyguards across Scintilla and beyond, and more than a few have found their way into the service of the Holy Ordos.

#### **Metallican PCs**

A Metallican is accustomed to the constant presence of gun violence and lawlessness on a level more profound than is usually found in even the most violent or militant of Imperial hives. To have a gun is to hold your life in your hands, and to go unarmed is to willingly surrender to death or slavery, whether your trade is as a mercenary or scholar. Because of the anarchic and precarious nature of their lives, Metallicans tend to be proud, sometimes self-absorbed, and highly sensitive to insult or slight. Conversely they are usually very respectful of any authority earned through knowledge or by skill at arms, and anyone willing to put their lives on the line for family, cause or creed.

#### **Creating Metallican Characters**

Use the Hive World Home World template, replacing the Accustomed to Crowds trait with those presented here:

#### **Gunmetal Hiver Skills**

You begin play with the Speak Language (Metallican Hive Dialect) (Int) skill.

#### **Packing Iron**

Metallicans put great store in their guns, be it the simple single shot snub that workers are allowed to carry or a stubjack's custom duelling piece. They invest them both with their sense of self-worth and almost supernatural qualities of protection. If a Metallican swears an oath, it is on their iron.

**Effect:** If you are, for any reason without a usable gun, either because you have been disarmed, caught unawares, or run out of ammunition, you take a –5 penalty on all Tests.

#### **Way of the Gun**

All Metallicans know how to use a variety of firearms and most are better than average shots; it's just in their blood.

**Effect:** Increase your Ballistic Skill by +5. You also begin play with the Pistol Training (SP) talent. You gain a +5 bonus on Tech Use Tests involving projectile firearms.

#### <span id="page-24-0"></span>**Maccabeus Quintus (Imperial World)** Maccabeus Quintus (Imperial World)

*"Here a man died and a saint was born. It is a place of blessedness and of legends, and its time shall come!"*

— Pontifex Grabrilus of Maccabeus Quintus.

A world of vast dry salt flats, dust-laden winds, and harsh chill sun; the fifth planet of the unforgiving Maccabeus star is nevertheless a blessed place. Blessed not because of the resources it is gifted with (which are few), or because of the climate (which is harsh), but because of faith that grows in the dust like the Ghostfire blooms on far Iocanthos. For this is the place were a great man fell and was raised up a saint by the glory of the Emperor.

The holy chronicles tell in the dawning days that General Drusus, commanding the Trailward salient of Angevin's Crusade, had pushed towards the Halo Stars, hoping to carve out a stable domain in what had been a fraught and bitter decade of war, when a sudden vicious resurgence of hostilities in the systems around Spectoris at his rear caused his advance to shudder to a halt. The order to mass and regroup was given. The planet chosen for this gathering was an uncolonised world in the obscure and unoccupied Maccabeus system, and as Drusus's forces gathered, the general himself prayed for guidance, knowing that a wrong choice could result in the collapse of the salient and jeopardise perhaps the fate of the whole Crusade. Infamy struck, and employing unholy methods, his enemies discovered Drusus's location and unleashed a deadly and unnatural assassin against him. Drusus fell, but even as the killing blow was struck did the power of the Emperor rent the assassin apart and spared the great man. After ten days and nights in shadow did Drusus return, and the power of the Emperor was within him. In the years that followed, Drusus knew not defeat, and one after the other did his enemies fall and Calixis was born. So it was that on dry Maccabeus Quintus, the Emperor raised Drusus up, the life of a man ended and the life of a saint began.

Today Maccabeus Quintus is a world of hard, bright light and deep darkness: of open, echoing spaces, cold, arid planes and great shrine cities from which coloured prayer pennants flutter. It is also a distant counterweight and perhaps one day will be a threat to the primacy of the Ecclesiarchy's holdings on Scintilla. To those born and raised in the cold shadows of the Maccabean shrine cities, faith is central to their lives. They know that no matter the harshness of their lives, they are the children of a place favoured in the sight of the Emperor.

#### **Maccabian PCs**

Faith is so much a part of your life that it is as essential as the air you breathe. To ask whether you are faithful is like asking whether you are alive. You are a Maccabian and even if you are a rogue or a killer, that means you are blessed in the sight of the God-Emperor.

#### **Creating Maccabian Characters**

Use the Imperial World Home World template, replacing the Superior Origins trait with the ones detailed here:

#### **Barren World**

Maccabeus Quintus is an arid and bitterly cold world with a harsh, bright sun, and prone to terrible famines and droughts which leave their mark even on its strongest inhabitants.

**Effects:** You take a –5 penalty on all Perception Tests that involve sight. In addition, reduce your starting Toughness by –3. In exchange, you begin play with the Resistance (Cold) talent.

#### **Beloved of the God-Emperor**

To be born on the shrine world of Maccabeus Quintus is to know that you are born of a place blessed by miracles and touched by a saint.

**Effect:** Increase your starting number of Fate Points by 1.

#### **Sinophia (Imperial World)** Sinop hia (Imperial World)

*"Cursed? No not cursed. Who can say that amongst all these riches?"*

> — Sire Morcar Del Sheen, The Sanctum Cells, Sinophia Magna.

Sinophia was once a world of pivotal destiny and economic power on the very edge of the Calixis Sector but is now little more than forlorn and forgotten relic of the past, an ancient and mouldering world of deserted cities and faded grandeur. Robbed of its population and trapped in an economic downward spiral that has lasted centuries, the planet is rife with petty corruption, apathy and slow decay. Its remaining inhabited areas are a wasteland of neglect and partial abandonment, ruled by a bickering, jaded aristocracy headed by a near-powerless figurehead governor, while its people labour under the heavy burden of the taxes imposed on them by their dissolute masters. Shorn of hope and empty of purpose, Sinophia is a world slowly dying.

Founded in elder days as the personal fief of the Rogue Trader Teresa Sinos, the world would, a millennium later, serve as a primary staging post for the Angevin Crusade that carved the Calixis Sector into being. But as the centuries passed and Calixis coalesced into its own sovereignty and self-sufficiency, Sinophia's prominence began to wane as its purpose faded. Increasingly sidelined and marginalised, much of its population, sickened by the excesses of the nobility, began to flee. Many took passage as colonists, lured by the perceived freedoms of life on new worlds, while their embittered rulers attempted to fight back with spiteful intrigues and secret plots, but only succeeded in further bankrupting their world and dooming Sinophia to its blighted fate.

Sinophia, today, is a world suffering the final throws of a long drawn-out death by economic starvation and slow civil collapse. Criminality and corruption are utterly ingrained and what little off-world contact it has is with smugglers, independent cartels (themselves skirting the fringes of the law) and a few hardy <span id="page-25-0"></span>pilgrims. Whole cities lie deserted, and where Imperial civilisation does exist, it does so in twilight, clinging desperately to the faded glories of the past amidst the crumbling decay of the present.

#### **Sinophian PCs**

Malaise, melancholy and corruption (in both the mundane and esoteric senses) are the abiding qualities of the Sinophian people—hope is simply a word, faith and ambition are the subjects of quiet, bitter mockery, and selfishness is viewed as a survival trait. Sinophians are, to put it bluntly, a morose, fearful, self-absorbed and often vicious and untrustworthy lot, and usually assume that everyone else is the same. There are obviously plenty of exceptions to this stereotype, both good and bad, and perhaps the most dangerous of them are the ones who genuinely have found a cause to believe in, because they often take to it with the fanaticism of a true convert.

#### **Creating Sinophian Characters**

Use the Imperial World Home World template, replacing the Blessed Ignorance, Hagiography, and Superior Origins traits with the ones detailed here:

#### **Blighted Origins**

Growing up in the slow decay of Sinophia burns bitterness, malaise and regret into the soul. It teaches you to watch your back and never trust anyone but yourself. These lessons have not been gained without a price…

**Effect:** Increase your starting Perception Characteristic by +5 and gain the Paranoia talent. Reduce your starting Willpower and Fellowship Characteristics by –3 each.

#### **Decayed Society**

Sinophian society is a decayed shadow of its former greatness: corruption and moral rot have penetrated into its every crevice and walk of life.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Deceive (Fel) skill. You also treat Common Lore (Underworld) (Int), Forbidden Lore (Cults) (Int), and Forbidden Lore (Heresy) as Basic Skills.

#### **Volg Hive—fenksworld (Hive World)** Volg Hive–Fenksworld (Hive World)

*"If you go to that Emperor-forsaken place, take their advice: keep a bullet. Always keep one. Not for them, you understand—no, keep it for yourself."*

— Investigator Verger Bor.

Within the Calixis Sector, and possibly even beyond, Volg has a justified claim to being the most blighted, miserable, hell-sent place one could have the misfortune to be born in. Poisoned by the effluent of its siblings, Volg exists for one purpose only; to supply the other hives and settlements of Fenksworld with purified water and recycled products from run-off waste and the acidic silt of the mire in which it sits. Rather than reaching towards the heavens, Volg plunges

down into the fetid depths. When viewed from above, its filth encrusted domes, corroded gantries and sucking vapour intakes nestle in the fens like the boils and scabs of some chronic disease digging into the planet's carcass.

Despite all this hopelessness and horror, a population of hardy men and women, descended in the main from convicts and outcasts, has not just survived but begun to thrive in the harsh conditions, although what kind of life they lead and, if they remain sane is open to some debate. Life is, if anything, appallingly precarious in Volg, pollution poisoning, rotting plagues, chem-spills and starvation are all common, and yet commoner still is murder, for violence is omnipresent and Volg's society brutal. Nor are the Volgites alone. In the depths there are things—pale, stinking, bloated things that writhe and hunger. The rail-walks and gate-landings are studded with hand-cranked stubbers trained on the darkness below, guarding against the nightmarish things that regularly seek to crawl up and feast. Volgites know not to trust to such protection, to trust anything or anyone but themselves, to keep watch on the dark and keep their mercykiller close. To survive in Volg, one needs more than just strength or even luck; one needs steel in the soul, an utter lack of conscience, constant vigilance, and perhaps a touch of destiny.

#### **Volg PCs**

One thing that can be said of a Volg hiver; they are hard to kill. After all, they have reached adulthood in a place that consumes thousands by disease, malnutrition, and the rotting effect of pollutants. Less "fast-mouthed rake" and more "hardeyed stone killer", the Volg born are utterly committed to their own survival and have little compunction in doing what it takes to achieve the next breath.

#### **Creating Volg Characters**

Use the Hive World Home World template, replacing the Wary trait with the ones detailed here:

#### **Volg Hiver Skills**

You begin play with the Intimidate (S) and Speak Language (Volg Hive Dialect) (Int) skills.

#### **Born Survivor**

Anyone who has survived to reach adulthood in a place like Volg has learned how to think fast, deal with horror and save their own skin—if they hadn't, they'd have wound up dead in a chemical pit already.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Jaded, Light Sleeper and Melee Weapon Training (Primitive) talents.

#### **Grim**

Volgites are tight-lipped and dour survivors with a mean streak as wide as a Titan's stride, and a certain worrying tendency to psychosis.

**Effect:** Swap your starting Fellowship and Toughness values, so that you have a starting Toughness of 25+2d10 and a Fellowship of 15+2d10. You also begin the game with 1d10 Insanity Points.

#### <span id="page-26-0"></span>Marked by the Past— Calixian Background Packages Marked by the Past– Calixian Backg round Packag es

*"The fires through which we pass in this life are but the light of the Emperor's forge. Our triumphs and tragedies are the heat by which we are tempered into weapons fit for his service."* — Commissar Captain Jourian Al'Eutar, Gunmetallicus 41st.

The following section details a variety of optional Background Packages for your characters. These backgrounds offer your Acolytes an extra level of detail by filling in more of their past and experiences before joining the Inquisition; providing your character with a "story" of their own. Each presents some "hooks" to help you form a basis for their personality, beliefs and goals, not to mention the reason why they have come to the attention of the Holy Ordos. T

Depending on your character's Career, the Background Package may take the form of a particular academic school you attended, a terrible event you were caught up in, a war you fought, a sect you belonged to, or even a case you investigated. Regardless, this event marks a pivotal moment in your character's development.

As well as providing your character with a history, each Background Package also comes with an effect, in terms of particular Skills, Talents or Traits (some of them quite unique) for your character to have developed as a result of your past. In many cases, these packages also feature some fairly serious drawbacks either in the shape of some deficiency of ability, or perhaps even in terms of Insanity or Corruption Points; the 41st Millennium is a dark place after all, and all knowledge has its price.

#### **Using Background Packages** Using Background Packages

Background Packages provide a suite of Characteristic adjustments, Skills, Talents and, in some cases, Traits. Any adjustments to your character by selecting a Background Package does not count as an Advance for the purpose of increasing your Rank, nor do increases or reductions count toward the improvement of your Characteristics through normal means.

To select a Background Package, you must meet its requirements. All of the following packages are organised by Career Path and thus you may only select a package that matches your chosen (or rolled) path. Many Background Packages also include a Home World or Origin requirement, which you must also meet. Finally, Background Packages all have an xp cost, which must be paid from your starting experience during character creation. The price covers the whole Background Package; you can't spend less for parts of it. It's all or nothing. Likewise, you may find that packages grant you Talents you might not otherwise be able to take owing to Characteristic restrictions. You do not have to meet the requirements of any listed Talent gained from the package since the benefits is undoubtedly hard earned!

You may only acquire a Background Package at the start of Character Creation. You cannot go back and select a package later in your character's Career, nor can you ever have more than one Background Package. Background Packages are entirely optional and you should always get your GMs permission before selecting one for your character.

Example: Wells has rolled up a Void Born Assassin character and wants to take a Background Package. He looks up those available for the Assassin Career and finds there are three options, the Moritat, Astral Knives and the Sons of Dispater. He checks the packages' requirements and sees that the Moritat is not open to Void Born characters, and so must choose from the other two. He selects the Astral Knives option (fancying the idea of a being a deluded cultist) and, having received the goahead from his GM, he applies the package effects to his character: he adds the additional full Skills and base Skills listed under Effects on to his character sheet, and rolls 1d5 Corruption Points. He also marks off 200 xp (the package's cost) from his starting xp and goes on to spend the rest of his xp normally.

You can off course vary the "story" within the package to suit your own tastes and ideas—and indeed you are encouraged to do so—so long as the effects and cost are the same of those listed. It's also recommended that no two Player Characters in your group use the same package for the sake of variety, unless of course your GM has a fiendish plan in mind…

#### **Adepts: Knowledge is Power** Adepts: knowledge is Power

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Adepts.

#### **Munitorium Quastor**

#### **Cost:** 100 xp

The Departmento Munitorium is a vast and unforgiving organisation with the relentless task of keeping the Imperium's armed forces supplied with everything from starship plasmacores to bootlaces and bullets. This, as can be imagined, requires a great deal of unimaginably complex logistical effort and administration. Thus the role of the quastor in this is one of unblinking oversight and ruthless control. Such individuals must also see that harsh discipline and work quotas are rigidly enforced, and remain vigilant for signs of rebellion or <span id="page-27-0"></span>malcontent. Regularly targeted by criminals and even cultists who seek to plunder arms and equipment, not to mention by the vengeance of aggrieved labourers and prisoners, quastors have a justified reputation as being dour, humourless and a justly paranoid lot.

The quastor's life is neither safe nor pleasant, but the attention to detail and arbitrary judgment it engenders are of obvious use in a servant of the Holy Ordos. Any quastor inducted into the ranks of the Inquisition is likely to find they have simply swapped one set of familiar dangers for far larger and even more terrible perils.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce your starting Willpower and Fellowship each by –5.

**Skills:** You gain Command (Fel), Common Lore (Imperial Guard) (Int), Inquiry (Fel), Search (Int), and Security (Ag) as starting Skills.

**Talents:** You begin play with Paranoia.

#### **Scholar of the Colleges Hetaireia Lexis**

**Home World:** Imperial World or Noble. **Cost:** 100 xp

The Hetaireia Lexis is a loose organisation of academic and private institutes, devoted to learning and the higher arts, with a strange and chequered history. Established by Lord Sector Caracalla some six centuries ago, their independence and rights are protected by a binding legal charter granting them rare autonomy despite being outside the control of the Adepta. Over the years, the Hetaireia has survived numerous changes in sector governorship, Ecclesiarchy opposition, scandals, murders, heresy trials, blasphemous rumours and even a full Inquisitorial purge of one of its contributing bodies, and yet continues to operate to this day. There are perhaps a dozen separate institutions operating under the Hetaireia's umbrella and scattered across the sector. They range from small cloistered scriptoriums with no more than a few score students to the Lexis Maxima—a labyrinthine complex housing over a thousand scholars in the shadow of the Lucid Palace itself in Hive Sibellus.

Many Inquisitors regard the Hetaireia as a breeding ground for dangerous ideas and freethinkers. Others see the learned men and women it produces as a potentially valuable resource to be exploited. For such a scholar coming to the Inquisition's notice, life as an Acolyte is usually a far more preferable fate to the potential alternatives.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase your Intelligence by +3. Reduce your Weapon Skill and Strength each by –5.

**Skills:** You gain Ciphers (Secret Society—Hetaireia) (Int), Forbidden Lore (any one) (Int), and Scholastic Lore (any one) (Int) as starting Skills.

**Talents:** You begin the game with Peer (Academic).

#### **Void Commercia**

#### **Home World:** Void Born. **Cost:** 200 XP

The Calixis Sector thrives on trade for without it, it would wither and die. Maintaining this trade is no easy task as interstellar travel is a dangerous, disturbing and esoteric business, and usually best left to those born to its vagaries. So in order to protect their interests, the various planetary based guilds, corporations and noble houses that make up this vast economic network each maintain a staff of highly trained and specialised adepts to act as their agents and administer their cargos as they make passage between the stars. These specialised adepts—the Void Commercia as they are known—are usually recruited and trained under contract from the Administratum itself, although some larger organisations are more than able to draw them entirely from their own ranks.

Unlike most adepts, Void Commercia are usually quite familiar with the experience of star-travel and delight in their pampered life, serving as a mouthpiece for a distant master. Now suborned or cashiered into the Inquisition's service for their skills and specialised knowledge, the demands on them are far different and they are expected to leave old loyalties behind. No one will watch out for them now, leaving them to fend for themselves.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce your Weapon Skill and Toughness each by 5.

**Skills:** You gain Barter (Fel), Charm (Fel), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Common Lore (Mercantile) (Int), Evaluate (Int), Scrutiny (Per), and Secret Tongue (your former master's organisation† ) (Int) as starting Skills.

† For example, you might choose Goldentongue for the trade guilds of Hive Tarsus or Cordcordia for the DeVayne Corporation.

#### **Arbitrators: Case File Access Denied**  Arbitrators: Case File Access Denied

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Arbitrators.

#### **The Calixian Pattern Killings**

#### **Cost:** 200 xp

In form, the gruesome killings are unremarkable: a throat slashed by a blade of exceeding sharpness, in some cases severing the head completely; sometimes the corpse is further slashed and dismembered and organs are removed. Crimes of such violence are sadly not uncommon in the Imperium, but in this case something far darker is transpiring, for the killings form an ongoing pattern separated by geography and time, sometimes whole worlds apart. The finest seers and savants have been driven mad for merely focusing their minds on the mystery and for

centuries the killings have not stopped, nor has their meaning been deciphered.

The diversity of the victims and the locale of the crimes are great. Some are the lowliest of workers slaving in a processing mill, others have been wealthy and important individuals killed in their homes. All the killings occur at night, in some cases a darkened public space mere yards away from other citizens who hear nothing of the crime done so close to them. Some victims have been found dead in locked rooms, the only access a window opening to a perilously long drop. Those who have caught a glimpse of the killer give a consistent and disturbing set of details: a pair of eyes glittering so they almost appear to burn, a strange fluid quickness of movement, and the swirl of a dark cloak or the repeated tap of a cane. All who have confronted him (or it) have been left maimed or dead.

The Holy Ordos and the Tyrantine Cabal in particular, maintain a constant watch for examples of the pattern repeating; sifting mountains of data in the vain hopes of discerning its dark purpose. In doing so sometimes they come across an arbitrator or even a local enforcer with the wit and skill to detect the pattern themselves, these individuals are often inducted into Inquisitorial service the alternative, after all, is somewhat wasteful.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase either Intelligence or Perception by +5.

**Talents:** You begin play with Talented (Inquiry).

#### **The Empty Men of Sinophia Magna**

#### **Cost:** 100 xp

A little over three years ago, reports reached Ordos Calixis of a series of gruesome and bizarre deaths in the city of Sinophia Magna that shocked even the inhabitants of that benighted world. The truth of what happened has been completely suppressed. However, stories persist on Sinophia of widespread casualties, of Arbites turning on each other and, most dreadfully, of men transforming into ravening monsters with inhuman strength, driven to rend apart their own bodies and any others they could reach.

The terrible truth behind these stories lay in a conspiracy and a failed plot by the heretical tech-cult known as the Logicians to perform the utterly forbidden act of the combining the sacred human form with xenos biology and raise an army of "perfected" humans. The horrific culmination of the investigation saw the destruction of the Adeptus Arbites precinct-house by traitors within, and a full-scale Inquisition-led raid on the PDF medicae centre where the deviant bio-alchemists of the cult had pursued their transgenic blasphemy. Those that saw what lurked inside the sub-levels of that facility, hidden so carefully from human sight, were forever scarred by the revelation.

Many of the loyal arbitrators that fought during the affair where taken into the Inquisition in the days and months that followed. The survivors themselves have been marked by the horrors that they saw. These qualities may be particularly valued by Ordo Xenos Inquisitors of Monodominant leanings, as soldiers in the war to keep mankind from the corruption of the alien and the evil within.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character. Talents: You gain Hatred (Tech Heretics) and Paranoia. Insanity Points: You gain 1d5 Insanity Points.

#### **The Red Vaults of Luggnum**

#### **Cost:** 100 xp

Heresy likes to find quiet, unloved and unobserved places to take root. The mining world of Luggnum was undoubtedly fertile ground for it to grow. For years, dark reports and rumours of misrule leaked from the domains of Lady Orlea Grey on this backwater mining world. When sub-sector Arbites control finally despatched a fifty strong investigation and suppression force expecting to find some starving cult hiding in the mines, they walked instead into a veritable hell that took their lives and shredded their sanity. Confronted with murder-mazes where hapless workers had been hunted through the subterranean passageways by killrigged servitors bonded to unholy devices that craved flesh and blood to thrive, the few that escaped to the upper levels learned the dreadful truth that the entire mining complexes had been turned into a hedonistic charnel house by Lady Grey—the "Crimson Countess" as she was called by her favoured intimates. Lady Grey constructed the place for her own bloody sport and that of the corrupted owners of Luggnam's Ironback mines. A full scale Castigation Purge by the sector Arbites and the Ordo Hereticus followed, but it was not until much later that the true secret was discovered: Lady Grey was not herself. She was, in fact, one of the most infamous heretics in the sector—Myrchella Sinderfell, the "Red Angel of Vaxanide", a women thought dead for over a hundred years. Some believe she survives in spite of the Castigation, since her body was never recovered from the ruins of Grey's fortified estate.

The Arbites that survived the initial investigation into the Red Vaults are few, but hardened by what the terrors they encountered. The Inquisition quickly found use for many of their small number. Particularly, they are suited to work with more brutal Inquisitors, whose methods are easily stomached by these cold-eyed men and women who have seen the terrible price of letting heresy fester.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase Willpower by +3.

**Talents:** You begin play with the Jaded talent.

**Insanity Points:** You start the game with 1d5 Insanity Points.

#### <span id="page-30-0"></span>**Assassins: Societies of Murder** Assassins: Societies of Murder

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Assassins.

#### **The Astral Knives**

#### **Home World:** Void Born.

**Cost:** 200 xp

As members of a proscribed Imperial Death Cult, the Astral Knives must keep their beliefs secret to all but their most trusted confidents. A secret society within the closed society of the void born, the Astral Knife cult takes it upon themselves, as a sacred duty, to keep mankind safe during voyages through the warp. If a voyage suffers, dark portents are witnessed or danger draws close in the warp, the Astral Knives carry out a sacrifice to ensure the Emperor's protection. Those most obviously "unclean" targets, such as mutants and psykers, are selected first, but almost anyone might be selected in consultation with ritual foretelling.

Some fifty years ago the Ordos Calixis declared the Astral Knives a heretical sect after it was found that worshippers of the Ruinous Powers had infiltrated large parts of the cult, and a concerted purge was undertaken. Despite this, the entrenched and widely dispersed death cult lives on, although scattered and in far fewer in numbers than before.

An Astral Knife cultist is usually born rather than made, with certain void families having long traditions of involvement with the cult, either as assassins themselves or in tacitly providing support. Nor are they ravening killers. They are taught instead that their murders, often arranged to seem as accidents, are a dreadful but necessary duty. Some members grieve over their victims when appropriate, although many seek to hone their skills further by taking payment for the use of their skills among the void born, particularly if the target is a "dirtsider" or not of the ship.

Some more Radical elements of the Inquisition have chosen, where possible, to absorb the surviving untainted Astral Knives into their service as skilled spies and killers, and the Knives for their part, are keen to prove their faith.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You begin play with Ciphers (Secret Society—Astral Knives) (Int) and Deceive (Fel). You may also treat Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Int) and Tech Use (Int) as Basic Skills.

**Corruption:** You start the game with 1d5 Corruption Points.

**Note:** Astral Knives are members of a proscribed society. If this becomes generally known, they may well suffer the wrath of the Arbites, witch hunters and Inquisitors less "understanding" than their master.

#### **The Moritat**

**Home World:** Feral World, Imperial World or Hive World. **Cost:** 300 xp

The Moritat is an Imperial Death Cult, far older than Calixis itself. Some legends say it was brought to Calixis by adherents secreted among the forces of the Angevin Crusade who carved the sector into being. Others claim it was already seeded in place, waiting for the Imperials when they came. Regardless, the Moritat leans heavily on the Imperial Creed, albeit with a very bloody and mystical interpretation of its dogma. It teaches that only through the merciless application of violence and death can the Imperium be sustained, the weak and corrupt winnowed out and the Emperor's own great sacrifice honoured. In organisation, the Moritat is supremely difficult to infiltrate or pin down, operating in independent cells each led by a single master or mistress seeded in recruiting grounds such as underhives, feral world wildernesses and war zones. The Moritat selects those who have already been "marked" by tragedy and bloodshed to serve the Emperor as a bringer of death to His enemies. They take these individuals from a young age and forge their bitterness and hate into a weapon. Training recruits relentlessly in the arts of destruction, deception and bloodletting, while at the same time indoctrinating them into their own brand of Imperial faith and the mysteries of the cult. Moritat aspirants who survive this education become full members of the cult and are sent out alone into the wider Imperium—a process they call the "travail" to hone their skills as assassins, vigilantes and peerless duellists, believing that only through continuous conflict and bloody experience can they become supreme in their arts and worthy to serve the Emperor.

The existence of the Moritat is something of an open secret in the hierarchy of the Calixian noble houses and the Adepta, although facts about them are scarce in the extreme. The cult's existence also seems to benefit from some measure of toleration by the Imperium's higher powers, a fact that leads some to whisper that the Moritat's true sponsorship lies with the distant and dreaded temples of the Officio Assasinorum itself.

For a Moritat Assassin, the chance to serve the Inquisition is a blessed thing—dealing death to the God-Emperor's enemies first hand and also a proving ground where they can Test their skills against the most dire and powerful opposition imaginable. Many Inquisitors regard Moritat Assassins as invaluable resources, monsters of their own to fight the many monsters they must challenge.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce Fellowship by –5.

**Skills:** You begin the game with Climb (S), Secret Tongue (Moritat) (Int), Shadowing (Ag), and Silent Move (Ag).

**Talents:** You gain the Jaded talent.

**Insanity Points:** You start the game with 1d5 Insanity Points. **Equipment:** Replace your normal starting equipment with the following: mono-sword, six throwing knives, crossbow pistol and twenty bolts, grapnel and line, equipment harness, 3 doses of stimm, and a protective bodyglove (2 points Primitive armour to the Body, Arms and Legs).

**"Identify your target. Concentrate your fire on it to the exclusion of all else. When it is destroyed choose another target. That is the way to secure victory."**

**The Bloody Edge (Trait):** the Moritat disdain many modern weapons as crude and spiritually unfulfilling, preferring instead the sacred edge of the blade. As a result, they must pass a Hard (–20) Willpower Test to use any weapon lacking an "edge" in combat (thrown blades, knives and arrows are fine) unless they obviously have no chance of harming their enemy otherwise. However, such is their deadly artistry at bloodletting, any edged weapon wielded by them counts as having the Tearing quality when used against living targets.

#### **The Sons of Dispater**

#### **Cost:** 100 xp

The Sons of Dispater care only for money. For them, every life has its price and only the station of the target and the ease of the kill mitigate the cost. The Sons started life as a mercenary company taking part in the vicious trade wars that flared up in the sector. It slowly coalesced into its modern shape, but with this refinement, it evolved to become a freelance guild of assassins, providing skilled murderers, duellists and saboteurs to anyone who could afford them. Over the years, the Sons have built up a well-deserved reputation for reliability and lethality and their reach extends outwards from their centre of operations on Malfi to almost every important world in the sector. While their only loyalty is to the gelt they have been paid, the organisation does consider its contracts to be inviolate, realising long ago that an organisation of turncoat assassins would have a very short life expectancy. Thus, any member of the Sons that betrays a contract had better hide their tracks very carefully or risk the wrath of their own.

The Inquisition is not above hiring an assassin trained by the Sons of Dispater, valuing their skills and predicable motivations. Likewise, the assassin may have fallen foul of the Inquisition unwittingly (a member of the Holy Ordos is one of the few targets the Sons consider off-limits), and now has little option but to make amends.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You gain Common Lore (Underworld) (Int), Intimidate (S) and Security (Ag) as starting Skills.

**Equipment:** Exchange the sword that Assassins normally gain for a stub automatic, a silencer and two clips of ammunition.

**Note:** Any Sons of Dispater character who breaks or reneges on a contract—even at the Inquisition's behest—and lets this information leak out, acquires a death-mark from their erstwhile colleagues in the guild, requiring all members to kill the renegade on sight.

#### <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Clerics: Covenants of the Faithful** Cle rics: Cove n a n ts o f the Faithfu l

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Clerics.

#### **The Great Chantries of Tarsus**

**Home World:** Noble, Imperial World, or Hive World. **Cost:** 200 xp

The centre of the Ecclesiarchy's power in the Calixis Sector is undoubtedly the great Cathedral of Illumination in Hive Tarsus on the capital world of Scintilla. In the shadow of this great edifice to Imperial faith lies hundreds of minor chapels, priories and monastic orders, each serving some facet of worship, pilgrimage, or the monolithic bureaucracy of the Ecclesiarchy itself. Among these are the great chantries, colleges created to train those talented enough (or wealthy enough) for high rank within the priesthood. Many chantries are sponsored by individual noble houses or dogmatic sects who seek to further their own ends by influencing subsequent generations of the clergy. To their detractors, these chantries are at best divisive and, at worse, seditious breeding grounds for heresy or purely secular greed and ambition. Still, their presence and role has become the accepted tradition, and it is a powerful one.

Of the chantries, the Drusine is the oldest and most mysterious. The Scoriaen is a zealous hotbed whose claim is the great number of witch hunters they have produced in the past. Many nobles choose the Vulpine as a dumping ground for unwanted and unruly "children", while the recently founded Ignatian chantry is little more than a creature of the current high cardinal, made to consolidate his grip on power.

A cleric trained in a Tarsus chantry is likely to be more politically-minded than most and may harbour ambitions for high office one day. Some may see a role within the Inquisition as a stepping-stone to greatness or the vocation of Ordo-sanctioned witch hunter as their true calling. In either case a Tarsine Priest makes for a spiritually knowledgeable, worldly-wise and politically skilled Acolyte.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase Intelligence and Fellowship Characteristics by +5. Reduce Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Strength Characteristics all by –5.

**Skills:** You begin play with Charm (Fel), Common Lore (Ecclesiarchy) (Int), Scrutiny (Per) and Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int).

**Talents:** You start the game with Peer (Ecclesiarchy).

#### **Mendicantine Missionary**

#### **Package Cost:** 100 xp

The Mendicantine Fraters are an order of Imperial preachers and confessors dedicated to a life ministering to the Imperial fold and protecting the Imperial faithful out among the stars. They are missionaries who travel whenever need or the calling of their faith takes them, be it along the famous pilgrim trails or to all but forgotten worlds on the fringes of explored space. Fiercely independent wanderers, Mendicantines take and train novices as they find them, teaching them their creed in an ad-hoc and earnest manner. This reliance on providence over doctrine is the cause of some distrust within the wider clergy, and many well-situated cardinals find them and their ministries outside of the control of "proper" Ecclesiarchical authorities to be threat. The Mendicantines, however, have the protection of ancient tradition that holds that their order was created by no less than Sebastian Thor himself and thus they enjoy the respect of the common citizenry to maintain them.

Some Inquisitors find a Mendicantine's staunch independence, strong personal faith and survival skills to be great assets in an Acolyte cleric, particularly if they themselves have Thorian leanings. Many brothers see Inquisitorial service as a chance to directly protect the Emperor's people from spiritual harm and falsehood.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You gain Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Navigation (Surface) (Int), Scholastic Lore (Legends) (Int) and Survival (Int).

**Equipment:** Owing to your vow of poverty, halve the amount of Thrones you gain for starting money. Also, you have a social class level of Outcast for determining monthly income (see page 124 of Dark Heresy).

#### **Redemptionist Firebrand**

#### **Cost:** 200 xp

One of the most common extremist groups, operating without official sanction on the fringes of the Ecclesiarchy, the Redemption is concerned only with the extermination of sin and the punishment of the sinner involved—preferably through the all-cleansing medium of fire. Mutants, heretics, and witches all justly fear the Redemptionist's attentions, but such is their frenzy and zeal, numerous innocents and petty criminals often end up on their pyres as well. In the Calixis Sector, the Redemption is only a real force in the underhives of Scintilla and on the frontier worlds along the Hazeroth Abyss where mutation is a common curse. However, it has recently made gains both among the survivors of war-torn Tranch and among the natives of strife-ridden Iocanthos, where its apocalyptic preaching's have found ready converts.

For all their ravings, pyromania, and complete lack of subtlety, the Redemptionists do have both fearless hatred for mankind's enemies and religious zeal in abundance both qualities that the Holy Ordos has an appetite for in its Acolytes. Redemptionist clerics brought into Inquisitorial service are likely to be the cream of the crop: smarter, more able and less openly "crazed" than their fellows; able to handle the needs of covert operations without going off on a rampage at the first sign of heresy. They are no less fanatical than any other of their kind, though, and once the time is ripe, they spare no effort or sacrifice to see the Emperor's enemies burnt for their sins.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce starting Fellowship by –5. **Skills:** You begin play with Interrogation (WP) and Intimidate (S).

**Talents:** You start with Unshakable Faith and Basic Weapon Training (Flame) or Melee Weapon Training (Chain). **Insanity Point:** You begin the game with 1d5 Insanity Points.

#### <span id="page-34-0"></span>**Guardsmen: The Ashes of War** Guardsmen: The Ashes of War

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Guardsmen.

#### **The Mara Landing Massacre**

#### **Cost:** 300 xp

Mara is a wretched place, a cold world once home to a penal colony now long silent. No one goes to Mara; the space around it is quarantined, the Imperial Navy mounting infrequent patrols to keep any from straying too close. However, such accursed places seem to draw in the unwary and the unfortunate. When a navigational error and mysterious engine failure caused the troop transport Vervilix to enter the Mara quarantine zone, forcing it to land, hell was visited on those unfortunates trapped there. What happened in the five days before the Imperial Navy reached the transport remains largely unknown. Only a few hundred gaunt and haunted individuals survived out of the five thousand Guardsmen that set foot on Mara, and of those, many were later were executed for heresy or simply disappeared unable to live with what they had experienced. For those few who survived, they will never admit that they were onboard the Vervilix unless under duress. Only the sealed reports of the Ordos contain the accounts of comrades turning on one another, of walking nightmares, vile scratching and halfheard whispers at reality's fabric, and the incessant buzzing of insectile wings on the edge of the mind.

Survivors of incidents on Mara are likely to be of most interest to Radical Inquisitors who see the experience as having armed them against the worst. Moreover, they are proven survivors if nothing else, and if some shadow of Mara's terrible mystery lingers on in them, that too is worthy of attention.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

Characteristics: Increase starting Willpower by +5.

**Talents:** You start the game with Resistance (Psychic Powers).

**Corruption:** Your experiences at the massacre means that you begin the game with 1d5 Corruption Points.

**Fate Points:** You gain one additional Fate Point.

**Insanity Points:** Unhinged, you start the game with 1d10 Insanity Points.

#### **Soldier of the Margin Crusade**

#### **Cost:** 200 xp

The Margin Crusade into the Halos Stars was launched following ratifying of the Lex Corvinus by the Great Synod Segmentum thirty years ago. This bull granted the power to raise a war of faith under the auspices of High Confessor Corvinus of Thracian Primaris and called upon the Sectors Scarus, Calixis and Ixaniad to provide the means. In the subsequent decades, the Crusade made scant progress and slowly exhausted itself, boiling away beyond the borders of Calixian space, far beyond the frontier world of Kalf. The Crusade continues to demand regiments from Lord Sector Hax, and he reluctantly supplies troops from the worlds of Calixis under the proviso that surviving veteran regiments are returned after a span of service before fresh meat is fed to the grinder. The war is a diverse and bloody affair, bogged down by the vagaries of warp travel and the tactical ineptitude of those in charge, achieving little despite thousands of lives spent and the continued admonitions of its controlling priests.

The soldiers who have returned from Corvinus's holy war are scarred veterans who have seen much in their travels, and their experiences out beyond the Emperor's light make them ideal for service with the Holy Ordos.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Characteristics:** Reduce Toughness by –3. **Skills:** You gain Awareness (Per) and Survival (Int). **Talents:** Gain the Unshakable Faith talent.

#### **Tranch War Veteran**

#### **Cost:** 100 xp

Even by Imperial standards, the war on Tranch has been a brutal and thankless affair. What started out as a simple mutant uprising on an unimportant minor hive world quickly escalated into political collapse and a catastrophic civil conflict drawing in forces from all over the sector to contain it. Even though the war's heat has quelled now from the quarter-million strong troop landings six years ago that broke the insurrection's back, the slow burning, bitter conflict has continued on a world tainted, twisted, and brutalised by centuries of malice and festering despair. Today the efforts to rebuild the world and re-establish order continue, and fresh regiments are continually cycled-in for tours of duty to brave the fireblackened spires and the treacherous dark furnaces of the Soot Warrens. Their thankless and dangerous task is to defend the remaining citizenry, to bring Tranch slowly to heel and prevent the festering enemies of mankind from claiming the place again.

Those Guardsmen who survive their time on Tranch rarely speak openly of their experiences, but the memories never leave them. Stories of starving refugees, oppressive dark catacombs, savage attacks by scav-cannibal infiltrators, of the pale and terrible witch-kin, and of seeing friends torn apart by "twist-brutes" are all whispered among Tranch veterans in the long watches of the night.

To an Inquisitor of a militant inclination, Tranch veterans are the most common source of tough, experienced and suitably intolerant muscle.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You gain the Search (Per) skill.

**Talents:** You start the game with the Hatred (Mutants) and Light Sleeper talents.

**Insanity Points:** Gain 1d5 Insanity Points.

#### <span id="page-35-0"></span>**Psykers: Translations and Revelations**  Psy kers:Translations and Revelations

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Psykers.

#### **A Shadow Over Thy Soul**

#### **Cost:** 200 xp

There is nothing more dangerous than the unguarded mind of a psyker. A nascent or unprepared psyker represents a delicious prospect to the things lurking beyond. Most psykers preyed on in this way are driven mad or possessed, and ultimately find their deaths at the Imperium's hand. A very rare few, though, triumph in their private war by their own strength of mind. Despite such a victory, most who encountered a Daemon in their emergence would be destined for execution as a moral threat by the forces of the Black Ships. No system is perfect and a fraction slip through the net. However, fewer yet survive their training and sanctioning to guard the secret shadow cast on their soul.

A psyker who has had such a blight is left unusually resistant to Chaos taint—a fact which may have attracted an Inquisitor who persecutes the corrupting forces of the warp. To them, the psyker's innate strength is a highly useful asset. The psyker, however, must be exceptionally careful to conceal the full reason for his resilience from his master. Alternatively, the psyker's past may be the very reason he or she was sought out by an Inquisitor of a more radical doctrine.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Skills:** You start the game with Forbidden Lore

(Daemonology) (Int). **Talents:** You gain the Dark Soul talent. **Corruption:** You gain 1d5 Corruption Points. **Insanity Points:** You have 1d5 Insanity Points.

#### **The Guiding Light of the God-Emperor**

#### **Cost:** 100 xp

The only light to guide a mind out of dark places is faith. To many psykers entrenched in a deep and abiding faith in the Emperor, the gift of psychic powers is a curse that can only be controlled by faith. Mastering their powers becomes a holy process, whereby the psyker pits their faith against the temptations of an ungodly will given power, often resorting to corporal mortification to shrive themselves of their failings. Every horror faced, every agony endured strengthens their faith and armours their minds; for they know they can never weaken least they become the abomination they despise.

As likely to loath other psykers as much as they loath themselves, a righteous psyker is utterly unforgiving and relentless in the pursuit of rogue psykers and witches, and as such, is a perfect tool for the witch finders of Calixis.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Characteristics:** Reduce starting Strength by –5. **Talents:** You gain Hatred (Witches) and Insanely Faithful.

#### **Living Nightmare**

#### **Cost:** 300 xp

There are powerful, subtle and cruel forces moving within the Imperium, some working for its salvation, while others seek its destruction. They are not the only forces at work, and there are ancient and terrible things unguessed at which predate man's first crawling steps, and beside which all of humanity are but children still. Some emergent psykers from the Calixis Sector can attest to this dark truth, having passed through unearthly horrors dwarfing those of the Black Ships they later endure. None speak of the strange devices humming with unearthly notes wielded by towering men in stark white rooms lying at the end of unending corridors. They know only that their new masters can see nothing of these strange phantasms, or indeed the depths of their minds at all. These psykers know it is better not to speak of such things, for pray the Emperor, it might have been a dream.

The unique powers of a psyker whose mind cannot be read is of obvious use to Inquisitors who face the dangers of enemy witches and renegades. There may, of course, be more complicated or darker reasons for an Inquisitor to keep such an individual near them.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase starting Willpower by +5. **Talents:** Gain Resistance (Psychic Powers).

**Insanity Points:** Start the game with 1d10 Insanity Points. **Unreadable Mind (Trait):** The deep recesses of your mind cannot be read by psychic (or other) means and any attempt to do so simply finds a fathomless void of darkness. You are completely immune to the Psychic Power, Mind Scan, as well as any similar effects or abilities.

#### <span id="page-36-0"></span>**Scum: Lives Spent in Shadow** Scum: Lives Spent in Shadow

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Scum.

#### **The Beast Slaver**

**Home World:** Feral World, Hive World or Imperial World. **Cost:** 100 xp

The fighting pits and carnivora offer a bloody and popular diversion on many worlds where the rich and poor alike pay to see bloodshed and vicious creatures do battle for their sport. Such places are often magnets for all kinds of illegal activity, outcasts and wanderers, and the worst they say belong to the organisation known as the Beast House. No one knows who heads the so-called Beast House, nor do many realise quite how far it has spread through the pale underbelly of the Markayn Marches but according to some it is a secret empire built on vice and suffering. Rumour has it there are other, even more unwholesome services the Beast House can provide; who can say what dire secrets lie at its heart? There have been several attempts by Imperial agencies to penetrate the higher echelons of the Beast House—none have ended well.

Some in the Inquisition actively seek out those who have been former associates of the Beast House, however peripherally. Such an obviously dubious individual is a potential infiltrator into the darkest reaches of the underworld or simply has use as a "lightning rod" for elements the Inquisitor wishes to flush out. Their agreement makes little matter either way.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** Gain Forbidden Lore (Mutants) (Int) or Scholastics Lore (Beasts) (Int).

**Talents:** You start with Melee Weapon Training (Shock) and Peer (Underworld).

**Corruption Points:** You begin the game with 1d5 Corruption Points.

#### **Cold Guild Courier**

#### **Home World:** Void Born.

**Cost:** 100 xp

Peerless smugglers among stars of the Calixis Sector, the Cold Guild's business is simple: transportation. Its membership is made up of anonymous crewmen, corrupt officials, petty merchants and even a few ships' captains, and its history goes back centuries. The Cold Guild's existence is something of an open secret, and though they may be outlawed by the Arbites and publicly decried by Chartist Captains, they persist, in no small part, because of their usefulness to many powerful groups and hidden factions. Of course, the Guild itself plays no favourites. Rarely bothered with petty contraband, the Guild specialises high-profit, high-risk cargos such as illegal arms and contraband, but for a price. It can be hired to move anything from people on the run, to small cargoes that cannot even pass through more

<span id="page-37-0"></span>conventional smuggling means. Be it the hunted renegade noble travelling as a corpse on a barge of the dead, to the vilest of most proscribed delights hidden in a fallen priest's aquila chain, the Guild can always find a way to make the crossing, and cares nothing for the consequences if their employers cannot meet their steep price.

Many Inquisitors, who have need of infiltrators and couriers to acquire the highest grade of information, find former Guilders to be great assets. In the hunt for proscribed and dangerous items, an expert eye for hiding places is also extremely useful. Though valued for their unique skills, some are reluctant to recruit from these groups, not just for their unsavoury pasts, but because the long periods of travelling in cryonic suspension or in cramped holds, as is oft-required by the Guild, take their toll on the health of their agents.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase Perception by +5, but reduce Toughness by –5.

**Talents:** You gain Concealed Cavity, Peer (Void Born), and Talented (Concealment) at the start of the game.

#### **The Brotherhood of Thollos**

**Home World:** Hive World or Imperial World. **Cost:** 200 xp

Muscle for hire is not hard to come by in the sector, but few can lean on a reputation as polished as that of the Brotherhood of Thollos. Once recruited only from the Infernis gangers of Gunmetal City, the Brotherhood has spread like a stain across the sector with Sibellan narco-gangers and other hardened types from the gutters of the sector's hives swelling its ranks. The Brotherhood offers some of the most professional, brutal and expensive stubjacks, heavies, thieves and bagmen that can be chartered on this side of the Halo Stars. Discerning in the jobs they take, the Brotherhood knows better than to anger the great powers of the noble houses and Adepta, but consider everybody and everything else fair game. Not all of those within the Brotherhood are mercenary hirelings; they also number talented fixers, information gleaners and black marketeers among their ranks. It is in the brutality underpinning organised crime that most of their members excel.

Scum who have learned their trade with the Brotherhood tend to consider themselves "professionals" in the criminal trade, and are used to hard knocks, sudden violence and betrayal. Most also possess a wide network of former employers, old contacts and rivals, all of which may be useful to their Inquisitor.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase starting Weapon Skill and Toughness each by +3. Reduce starting Fellowship by –5.

**Talents:** You begin the game with the Street Fighting and Peer (Underworld) talents.

#### **Tech-priests: Cults of the Mac hine**  Tech-Priests: Cults of t h e M a c h i n e

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Tech-Priests.

#### **The Disciples of Thule**

**Home World:** Forge World or Void Born. **Cost:** 100 xp

If the Adeptus Mechanicus explorators operating out of the Calixis Sector can be said to have an overall leader or spiritual guide, it is the Archmagos Paracelsus Thule. Many centuries old, Thule's fleet, which disappears out beyond the edge of mankind's domain for decades at a time, is vast and many explorator Adepts and Magos have served under his tutelage over the years, passing on his teachings to their juniors in turn. Thule's instruction centres on identifying pre-Imperial human technologies and sets the goal of finding the relics of mankind's glorious past above all other concerns and risks. This lack of caution makes Thule and those following him something of a radical faction within the Cult Mechanicus, but a powerful and influential one in the Calixis Sector.

Thule's disciples centre their studies entirely on analysis and study, valuing the acquisition of knowledge above all other concerns. They distain physical confrontation and are often so wrapped up in cogitation they fail to notice what is in front of them. Some Inquisitors appreciate this curiosity in their tech-priests, finding it preferable to the narrow thinking and conservatism many others of their kind demonstrate, even though curiosity almost always carries its own dangers.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Characteristics:** Reduce starting Weapon Skill and Perception each by –5.

**Skills:** You gain Common Lore (Machine Cult) (Int), Evaluate (Int), Forbidden Lore (Archaeotech) (Int), Logic (Int), and Scholastic Lore (Cryptology) (Int) as bonus Skills.

#### **The Divine Light of Sollex**

#### **Home World:** Forge World.

**Cost:** 300 xp

The weapon-mystics of the Cult of Sollex form a sect of the Adeptus Mechanicus based on the minor forge world of Haddrak in the Drusus Marches. The sect has expanded beyond its world of origin enjoying adherents among the Magos Militant of the Lathes and the tech-priests assigned to Battlefleet Calixis. The Sollex are a warlike sect who study the art of destruction and specialise in the occult mysteries of photon and laser, finding divine wisdom in a fractured spectrum of light. Aside from producing particularly powerful and advanced weapons and holo systems, the work of Sollex is reputed to have been put to more esoteric and hidden ends, and their secrets are well-guarded, even compared to the rest of the Cult Mechanicus.

A Sollex tech-priest may have been selected for Inquisitorial service owing to an above average experience of warfare, arms and hostile contact with the alien. They often seem even more inhuman than their fellows, far more fanatical and militant in their adherence to the mystical dogma of the Cult Mechanicus, and utterly unforgiving of those who blaspheme against the Machine God.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce starting Fellowship by –5.

**Skills:** You start the game with Ciphers (Secret Society— Sollex) (Int), Common Lore (Machine Cult) (Int), Demolition (Int), and Scholastic Lore (Tactica Imperialis) (Int). You also gain a +10 bonus on all Tech-Use Tests made when working on or with laser or holo devices.

**Talents:** You gain Hatred (Tech-heretics) and Unshakable Faith.

**Insanity Points:** You begin play with 1d5 Insanity Points.

#### **Malygrisian Tech Heresy**

**Home World:** Forge World or Void Born.

**Package Cost:** 200 xp

The infamous renegade Magos Umbra Malygris, known to Inquisitorial records as Malygris the Damned, led a widespread and insidious tech-heretic cult that flourished in the Malfian sub-sector three centuries ago. Many great crimes against both Imperial Law and the Cult Mechanicus's own doctrines were laid against him, including the fashioning of forbidden silica animus, corpse vivication and the unleashing of experimental viralstrains on unsuspecting populations to test their effects. Eventually the renegade was tracked down and he and his followers destroyed in bloody confrontation with a joint Inquisitorial-Mechanicus purgation. Since then his works and researches have been brutally, but not entirely successfully, suppressed. Despite the sanctions against it, Malygris's lore persists, kept alive in no small part by those tech-priests tasked to hunt down rebellious members of the Mechanicus itself, much in the same way as the more Radical factions of the Holy Ordos seek to turn the tools of the arch-enemy against its own followers, risking destruction at the hands of their own kind.

A tech-priest inducted into the Inquisition who has absorbed Malgrisian data walks a deadly tightrope. On the one hand, he is armed with knowledge of occult science few others can match, making him a very able opponent for the dark powers of heresy and corruption. On the other hand, such tech-priests already stand half-steeped in shadow, and are thus in peril for their very souls.

#### **Effects**

Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You begin play with Ciphers (Malygris Codex) (Int), Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Int), Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Int), Scholastic Lore (Legend) (Int) and Scholastic Lore (Numerology) (Int).

**Corruption:** You start play with 1d5 Corruption Points.

**Insanity Points:** You are Unhinged and begin with 1d5 Insanity Points.

**Note:** In absorbing this knowledge, you have jeopardised more than your life. If the source of your knowledge is somehow proved, you are in danger from elements of the Cult Mechanicus itself.

### Chapter II: Calixian Career Paths Chapter II: Calixian Career Paths

*"What is the self compared to the God-Emperor's service? Nothing."*

— Commissar Abdelus XXII.

Dark Heresy provides a solid overview of the various sorts of people the Inquisition might recruit in their efforts to uncover heresy and defeat the alien. Divided into broad archetypes called Career Paths, players might take on the roles of Guardsmen, bring to their Inquisitor expertise with a dizzying assortment of weaponry, psykers armed with strange and disturbing powers, or everything in between. While each Career Path brings with it a set of expectations and game functions, a character is much more D

than "just" an Assassin or "just" Scum. Even though classified as being a member of such a Career Path, characters have a lot of room for customisation, definition, and, above all, individuality. This chapter expands on the options available to Player Characters by offering an additional Career Path for characters of the Schola Progenium origin, while offering specific variations on Career Paths for characters hailing from and exploring the Calixis Sector.

**"A heretic may see the truth and seek redemption. He may be forgiven his past and will be absolved in death. A traitor will never find peace in this world or next. There is nothing as wretched or as hated in all the world as a traitor."**

The Sororitas of the Calixis Sector

The Adepta Sororitas have several holdings in the Calixis Sector, most famously the Abbey of the Dawn on the strifetorn planet of Iocanthos. The fortress-abbey stands nominally as a commandery of the Order Famulous of the Opening Eye under the Canoness Goneril, and specialises in training novices to operate within the machinations and intrigues of the Scintillan courts. It also houses a mission from the Order of the Ebon Chalice as an operational base for a force standing ready at the behest of , which serves Ordo Hereticus, under their Palatine Rhiannon holdings of the Sisterhood include the Sainted Encarmine Hospice . Less well known on Tranch, the library-keep of the Sanctum Dialogous on Solomon (whose contents are forbidden on pain on death to those without Inquisitorial clearance), and the Shrine of the Seventeen Martyrs on the agri-moon of Gallowglass in the Malfi system which houses a commandery of the Order Militant of the Bloody Rose Battle Sisters based here have seen extensive combat in recent . The years at the request of the Holy Ordos and the Ministorum. This has lead to Canoness Livia petitioning her superiors on Ophelia VII to reinforce the shrine into a full preceptory of the Order, a request that looks to be granted in the coming years quiet opposition by the authorities on Malfi, despite

#### <span id="page-41-0"></span>The Adepta Sororitas The Adep ta Sororitas

*"With Faith and Fire."*

— First Maxim of the Sororitas.

To be a sister of the Adepta Sororitas is to have a holy and divinely ordained calling to do the Emperor's will, to lead the faithful by example and to punish and destroy the heretic wherever and whenever it is found. The Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas (or the Daughters of the Emperor to give them their archaic title), are a powerful and largely independent collection of religious orders that form the militant wing of the Imperial Ecclesiarchy, protecting its domains, enforcing its will, destroying its enemies and defending the faithful. Each member of this all-female sisterhood is sworn to the Imperial Creed, relentlessly trained to excel and is utterly devoted to her Order, her work and the Imperial faith. T

The Sororitas is formed into two divisions: the great Convent Prioris on Terra and the Convent Sanctorum of the shrine world of Ophelia IV. The Sororitas is further subdivided into several component Orders. The principle task of the Orders Militant or Sisters of Battle is to persecute the Ecclesiarchy's wars of faith and serve as a fighting arm of Ordo Hereticus. Members of the Orders Famulous specialise as councillors, diplomats, teachers and investigators. The Orders Dialogous serves in translating and understanding ancient, xenos or heretical texts, ciphers and history. Finally, the Orders Hospitaller provides skilled surgeons and physicians to the Imperial military. Regardless of her Order, each Sororitas sister is a highly trained and adaptable agent of the God-Emperor. Each is willing to lay down their lives for Creed and mankind: strong of will and firm of purpose. They are also armed with one of the greatest of weapons in humanity's arsenal—faith.

The origins of the Adepta Sororitas lie in the dark days of the Age of Apostasy and perhaps even before. Their modern form took shape in the Reformation of Sebastian Thor that ended the wars of religious schism and gave birth to Ordo Hereticus. They owe their power in no small part to Thor's great Decree Passive that prevented the Ministorum from raising permanent bodies of "men under arms". Following the disbanding of the Ecclesiarchy's standing armies and fleets, the Sororitas were given the task of defending the Ecclesiarchy and Imperial faith from direct threat. They also form the Chamber Militant of Ordo Hereticus of the Inquisition, a zealous and utterly fanatical force of elite soldiers, learned savants and skilled physicians who are an invaluable part of the Hereticus's war on unbelief, witchery and, of course, heresy.

#### **The Power of Faith** The Power of Faith

The power of the purity, will and faith of an Adepta Sororitas sister is a tangible and real thing, capable of shielding her from the psyker's power or the Daemon's wrath and enabling her to perform deeds that are nothing short of miraculous. A Sororitas sister's faith manifests as a series of specialised Talents that allow the character to use her Fate Points in unique ways to achieve extraordinary effects. See [page 50](#page-50-0) for more details.

#### **Sororitas Characters** Sororitas Characters

Adepta Sororitas are courageous, pious, self-sacrificing, chaste and faithful. They are fanatics, bound by harsh and restrictive religious oaths and ingrained zealotry. As a Sororitas, the simple fact of who and what you are dictates many of your character's actions and responses— far more so, in fact, than almost any other character type or Career choice. Because of these factors, Sororitas characters are recommended for experienced players and are not included as part of the usual random character generation process.

<span id="page-42-0"></span>In order to create an Adepta Sororitas, you must obtain the GMs permission first. All Sororitas characters are human females without exception and cannot be marked with mutation or Corruption Points at the start of the game. You must hail from a Feral World or Imperial World, or have the Schola Progenium or Noble Origin. GMs should also consider the kind of campaign and adventures they intend to run before allowing their players to use Sororitas characters. This is not simply because the Sororitas Career is a powerful option (and it is unashamedly so) but because, if played correctly, a Sororitas character is completely and utterly unforgiving of anyone and anything that has truck with the forbidden in any form including other Acolytes, Radically inclined Inquisitors and anybody marked by mutation or the alien. Be warned!

#### **The Convocation of Nephilim**

The relationship between the newly reorganised Adepta Sororitas and the (then) newborn Ordo Hereticus was codified and formalised by at the legendary Convocation of Nephilim at the height of the Thorian Reformation. From this point onward, as the Chamber Militant of Ordo Hereticus, the Adepta Sororitas has stood apart from the Ministorum, serving as the sword to the throat of apostate, enemy of corrupt or deviant members of the Ecclesiarchy and, in its more familiar role, as the Ecclesiarchy's protector in times of war. Legend also whispers that, as part of the Convocation, secrets were told to Saint Dominica and the founders of Ordo Hereticus at the very foot of the Golden Throne itself. A path and mission was set for the two organisations, a path known only to those at the highest levels of either, that continues to rule their actions to this very day.

The Adepta Sororitas recruits promising candidates from a number of different locales, based upon promise, strength of character and, above all, piety. Years of harsh and exhaustive training follow in matters intellectual, physical and spiritual. There is much to be learned from basic weapon drill, to the lives of the saints and the many and complicated strictures, tenets and codes of the Rule of the Sororitas by which they must learn to live. Even up to the point where the aspirant dons the symbolic Ring of Suffrage and takes the Oaths of Adherence to become a novice sister, she may be failed by her tutors or leave at any time without censure. The sisterhood desires neither grudging obedience nor false piety in its ranks; they allow only those of true fanatic devotion.

#### **Novice Advances**

*"It is not enough to serve the Emperor, or even to love Him. You must give to Him all you have had, and all you ever shall have. To give over utterly and entirely to His divine will and become a vessel of that will. Only then is your sacrifice fitting."*

— from the Rule of the Sororitas.

The Rule is harsh and a novice sister must endure many hardships during her training. Self-denial, rigid discipline and religious contemplation are indivisible parts of their nature. They are armed not only with skills needed to defend the Ministorum but also with training that teaches them to fan the flames of faith to a roaring blaze.

The Role of Sororitas Acolytes Owing to the close ties between Ordo Hereticus and the Adepta Sororitas Inquisition for some part of their vocation , it is not an uncommon practice for Sisters to serve the Holy . Inquisitors, for their part, value Sororitas Acolytes for their skills, the power of their faith and for their incorruptibility—particularly when confronted by the spawn of the warp and their debased servants. Sororitas chosen by their superiors for independent or detached service in this way are often among the most capable and self-sufficient of their noviciate class, deemed strong enough to endure the rigors and perils of such duty. Often returning to the Sororitas even firmer in their convictions and honed in their skills. During any

"downtime" between deployments with the Holy Ordos, an Acolyte Sister will return to her Order to spend time fasting, meditating and training.She will also offer a full report under examination to her superiors. Sororitas that survive long asset for the Adepta in their war against heresy and faithlessness -term duties with the Inquisition are a very valuable , and are often destined for high rank.

#### **Cantus Advances**

*"It is not our place to forgive the heretic; only to pray for his unworthy soul as his ashes ascend from the pyre."*

— The Book of Castigations.

A sister's noviciate may last a number of years during which she must master the fundamentals of her duties and although she may have already been chosen to serve within a particular Order, the Adepta demands that each sister know the fundamental skills of all Orders so she can be a tool in the Emperor's hand, either to cure, learn, counsel or kill.

#### **Constantia Advances**

*"The Emperor is our father, our guardian, but we must also guard the Emperor."*

— Saint Dominica.

In the final stage of the noviciate, before they are inducted in to the full rank of Sister Adepta, the novice's learning encompasses the use of the Chamber Militant's sacredly ordained weaponry such as the bolter, resistance to the deceits of heresy and confirms her complete devotion to the Imperial Creed.

#### **D i alogou s Adva n c e s**

*"With His divine grace, I shall read that which should not be written, see that which should not be witnessed and endure that which cannot be borne. His radiance shineth on me and my soul shall remain pure."*

> — The First Oath of the Dialogous.

The Orders Dialogous focus their attention on the arts of the scholar, serving as translators and expert advisors in many fields. The armour of their faith makes them far less subject to petty corruption or hubris than others. The arts of the Dialogous are of obvious use to both the Ministorum and, most particularly, the Holy Ordos, as they are expert at unlocking hidden codes and obscure references, dragging the faintest hint of heresy into the light.

#### **Famula Advan c e s**

*"I come now before you not as a Sister of the Sororitas, nor as one of the faithful, nor even as your judge. I come as an emissary of He who sits upon the Golden Throne and I bring you His word: you have sinned and you will pay for those sins."*

— Sister-Famula Esme to the heretic Cardinal Galt.

The Orders Famulous devote themselves to diplomacy and negotiating. They are experts at dealing with the different branches of the Imperium and broker alliances and agreements between fractious power-blocks, guilds and noble houses. Their primary goal is to preserve the Imperium's order and ensure that those who rule or trade are also working towards this goal. Their task, however, enables them to covertly monitor those they serve for signs of corruption.

#### **Nunciate Advances**

*"Malefic I name thee, oh serpent under mine heel: scorn I give thee. My spite I pour on thee and with my hate I stab at thee—burn now Daemon in my sight."*

— The Chietwynd-Machen Antiphony, Chamber Militant Rites of Exorcism.

The rank of nunciate or "messenger" is afforded to those among the Orders Famulous and Dialogous who excel not only in their crafts, but who are also noted for their skills in leadership and experience at dealing with the Imperium's hierarchy. Such individuals are often entrusted to act on their own to represent their Order, or are tasked as close advisors to highly important individuals such as Inquisitors and Imperial commanders.

#### **Hospitaller Advances**

*"Ours is to honour the martyr, tend the fallen, defend the innocent and walk always in the light."*

— The Hospitaller's Book of Hours.

The Ordos Hospitaller are undoubtedly the best "loved" of all the Sororitas, serving as physicians and offering palliative care in the front line of the Imperium's many war zones and areas of disaster. To the common citizenry, they are saintly figures beyond reproach, but they are no more forgiving nor compassionate than the Orders Militant if confronted by heresy or the works of the Ruinous Powers.

#### **Curi a Adva n c e s**

*"Praise be the Emperor and pass the ammunition, for what one doesn't cure the other will."* — Common Sororitas Proverb.

Forged in the crucible of war and catastrophe, honed by faith and discipline, a Hospitaller's skills encompass not only the healer's arts, but also personal survival and the stewardship of those under her care in the harshest and most deadly of circumstances. A Hospitaller must know when to heal, when to give final mercy and when to watch for the hidden enemy.

#### **Almoness Advances**

*"Faithlessness is like a blightcanker on a tender rose, and like many parasites it attacks first the weakened vine before spreading to other healthier plants. So, like the best of gardeners, we must tend our blossoms well, knowing when to nurture, when to trim and when to rip up by the roots."* — Saint Ezrabeth, Reflections in a Golden Pool.

A Sister-Hospitaller is as likely to spend as much, if not more, time engulfed by the horrors of the battlefield as a Battle Sister. The most experienced Sister-Hospitallers become as hardened to its effects as any war veteran. Many experienced Hospitallers are called upon by both the Inquisition and the Imperial Guard to put their extensive skills and knowledge to darker ends in the service of the Imperium.

# II: Calixian Careers

#### **Militant Advances**

*"Heretics crave the cleansing fire of absolution. They need not fear for we shall deliver."* — Axiom First, attributed to Canoness Helflax of the Order of the Argent Shroud.

The Sisters of Battle, clad in powered armour, armed with bolter and flamer, are what the common Imperial citizen imagines first when they think of the Sororitas. The Orders Militant are the elite and merciless fighting arm of the Ministorum and Ordo Hereticus, eternally vigilant and ceaselessly loyal to the Imperial Creed.

#### **Elohiem Advances**

*"There can be no remorse or relent the war for men's souls."* — Ancient Terran Proverb.

As Battle Sisters advance and gain both in skill and experience, they are granted the mark of Elohiem, meaning that they have willingly shed blood in the Emperor's service. Such warriors may continue to fight as a veteran Battle Sister or be chosen to join a specialised formation such as the Dominion special weapon squads, the Retributor heavy support teams or the famed jumppack equipped Seraphim.

#### **Celest i a n Adva n c e s**

*"In fury, faith; in hatred, purpose; in battle, honour; in death, a martyr's end."*

> — The Book of Indoctrinations.

The most experienced Battle Sisters are granted the honorific of Celestian, marking them out as highly skilled veterans of hundreds of engagements and combats. Celestians are the equal of any other fighting force humanity has to offer other than the superhuman Space Marines, hugely skilled, tactically experienced and resolute in their faith.

#### **Superior Advances**

*"Come sisters, rejoice and be glad, for before this day ends we shall be at our Father's side."* — Sister Superior Lucrezia

Bask, The Last Stand on Gallowglass.

To have been nominated to join the ranks of the Sister Superiors is not only a high honour but also recognises the ability to lead in the candidate, as the title marks the officer-class of the Adepta Sororitas. Sister Superiors are inspirational leaders, acting in the forefront of the Adepta's work, demanding unflinching obedience to the Rule and unwavering faith in their subordinates. They are often given command of forces on the battlefield, field hospitals in active war zones or particular missions of investigation, as their individual order warrants.

*"Though doubts assail you, though the storms of war engulf you, though all your past certainties be proved empty lies, take strength and fear not. He is with us—the Emperor your God! Against Him no army shall stand, no tyrant shall endure, and no heresy shall go unpunished. Fear not because we stand with you—His daughters of cleansing fire and unyielding adamant, the bearers of His sacred wrath!"*

— Canoness Jocasta Vail's Sermon Extremis, The Second Siege of Vaxanide.

Just as the Sister-Superiors form the field officers of the Adepta Sororitas, so do the ascending ranks of Legatine, Palatine and Canoness form their high commanders. The most pursuant of warriors and greatest spiritual leaders the Sororitas possess, they inspire great devotion in those that follow them and are powers in their own right in the Imperium.

#### **The Power of Faith** The Power of Faith

The Adepta Sororitas and certain other blessed individuals are not merely servants of the Emperor; they are embodiments of the purity of His faith. Their faith is of such an intensity and focus that it is more than mere belief; it is a power in itself, a power that can achieve great and terrible things.

While many have faith in the Emperor, only a few have faith of sincerity, purity and, above all, focus that can manifest as miraculous effects. Such powerful faith is represented in Dark Heresy by a series of Talents that allow characters to produce amazing powers of divine will by spending or burning their Fate Points.

Like many normal Talents, Faith Talents are interlinked and staged so a character may only take a Faith Talent if they meet that Talent's prerequisites. The Talent forming the basis of all other Faith Talents is Pure Faith and a character must always have the Pure Faith talent to have or use any other Faith Talents.

**Note:** In the descriptions of several Talents the phrase "warp creature" or "warp entity" is intended to refer to all Daemons and Daemonhosts, as well as such creatures as Astral Spectres, possessing entities and other beings of the warp.

#### **Suffer Not the Unclean**

A character with more than 10 Corruption Points may not use any Faith Talents and may not acquire new Faith Talents. If, through some means, they reduce their number of Corruption Points to below 10, they may again use and acquire Faith Talents.

#### **Pure Faith (Talent)**

Your faith in the God-Emperor of Mankind, His divine power and grace, is total and complete. This faith wraps around you and suffuses your soul, armouring you so the foul influences and weapons of the heretic cannot bear to touch you. Pure Faith provides all of the following benefits:

- You are always immune to the effects of Daemonic Presence (including the negative modifiers to your Willpower).
- You may avoid taking a Fear Test, avoid acquiring Insanity Points and avoid gaining Corruption Points by spending a Fate Point. These safeguards remain in place for the duration of the encounter only.
- You may burn a Fate Point to resist the effects of any single Daemonic or psychic attack, effectively allowing you to emerge unscathed as if by a miracle.

#### <span id="page-51-0"></span>**Purge the Unclean (Talent)**

#### **Prerequisites:** Pure Faith

You can focus your faith through words, gestures and force of will, such that a Daemon may be cowed or cast out by the power of the Emperor.

- As a Half Action, you may spend a Fate Point to intone holy words to repel a warp entity. Make an opposed Willpower Test against the warp entity. If the Test succeeds, the warp creature is repelled a distance of metres away equal to twice your Willpower Bonus. It cannot approach closer than this distance for 2d5 Rounds.
- As a Full Action, you may spend a Fate Point to speak the rites of exorcism and force out a possessing warp entity from its host. Make an opposed Willpower Test against the warp entity. If the Test succeeds, the warp entity is driven out of the thing it was possessing and manifests in an adjacent space to its former host. The warp entity may not possess the host again for a number of hours equal to twice your Willpower Bonus.
- As a Full Action, you may burn a Fate Point to chant the Litanies of Detestation to purge a warp entity from reality. You must actually be confronting the thing and not just thinking about it. Test your Willpower. If you pass, you deal Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus plus your Willpower Bonus for each degree of success. On a failed Test, the warp creature takes Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus. Damage inflicted by this method is not reduced by the creature's Toughness Bonus, Daemonic Aura, Armour or any other forms of protection.

#### **Divine Ministration (Talent)**

#### **Prerequisites:** Pure Faith

You are a vessel for the Emperor's mercy and beneficence, your skill and faith in His divinity can heal where no mere skill can.

- When Testing Medicae, you may spend a Fate Point to restore an amount of Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus instead of the normal amount. This amount is then added to and multiplied in the normal way depending on the type of care (see the Medicae skill description on page 104 of Dark Heresy). In the case of first aid to a Lightly Wounded character, you restore an amount of Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus plus your Intelligence Bonus.
- You may spend a Fate Point to remove all Fatigue from a number of people equal to twice your Willpower Bonus.
- You may burn a Fate Point to allow a character who has just died to become Critically Wounded instead. This power has its limits though, (bullet to the chest—yes, missing a head—no) and it's subject to the GMs approval. If use of the Divine Ministration fails to work in this way, the Fate Point is not lost.

#### **Wrath of the Righteous (Talent)**

#### **Prerequisites:** Pure Faith

You are a killing angel and you visit the Emperor's righteous fury on those who deny His dominion over the stars or those who profane that which is sacred.

- When making an attack, you may spend a Fate Point to deal an additional 1d5 points of Damage.
- At any time while you are attacking, you may burn a Fate Point to trigger Righteous Fury on a single successful attack. The attack automatically deals the maximum Damage for the weapon plus 1d10 points of Damage. If the second roll results in 10, further Damage is possible (see Righteous Fury on page 195 of Dark Heresy).

#### **Blessed Radiance (Talent)**

**Prerequisites:** Purge the Unclean, Divine Ministration or Wrath of the Righteous.

Your holiness shines out, allowing all to see the truth of their own souls. Where you tread, those who follow need have no fear of the darkness, nor suffer the predations of the blasphemous.

- When spending a Fate Point to activate the Pure Faith talent, you extend the immunity to Daemonic presence to a number of targets equal to twice your Willpower Bonus.
- As a Free Action, you may bestow a single Fate Point to an ally. If the Fate Point is unspent, it returns to you at the end of the encounter.
- Upon burning a Fate Point, you and a number of allies equal to twice your Willpower Bonus become immune to the effects of Daemonic presence, Fear Tests and Corruption Points. In addition, all affected targets gain a +10 bonus on Tests made to resist psychic attack or any other form of psychic manipulation—affected targets take only half Damage from psychic and warp sources. These benefits last for the duration of the encounter.

#### <span id="page-52-0"></span>Modifying Existing Careers Modi fy ing Existing Careers

The remainder of this chapter trains its attention on Dark Heresy's Career Path system by expanding your options to offer more flexibility and individualisation through the use of Alternate Career Ranks and Elite Advances. Both options, as they are expressed here, are firmly rooted in the power groups, organisations and worlds of the Calixis Sector, and many build on the new options found in the Expanded Character Generation system described in Chapter I. Although these options do offer exciting choices and provide impetus for great roleplaying, many carry serious side effects. As with any new material, be sure to gain your GMs permission before investing in one of these options. T

#### **Alternate Career Ranks** Alternate Career Ranks

The following section details a number of Ranks that may be taken during your character's career progression as alternatives to the normal path of their Career. In many ways these Alternate Ranks change your character's potential abilities and direction but not their fundamental nature: you won't swap Career Paths, but rather your character's fate simply takes an unusual detour along the way.

These Alternate Career Paths serve two functions: the first is to offer you an opportunity to personalise your character and make him or her something unique and special. The second is to give characters a very definite place within the setting, a role amongst the powers and intrigues of the Calixis Sector. As the astute among you will notice, each Alternate Rank is firmly grounded in a particular conspiracy, organisation or even cult.

#### **Taking an Alternate Rank**

Alternate Ranks are attractive and for good reason. Gaining new powers, Skills and Talents, and giving you more tools to distinguish your character from others of your path are all excellent reasons for acquiring an Alternate Rank. To select an Alternate Rank, you must first secure your GMs permission. Several of the Alternate Ranks may complicate matters and be at odds with an existing plotline or campaign. Second, most Alternate Ranks include one or more prerequisites, which you must fulfil before taking the Rank. Finally, Alternate Ranks have a minimum level at which they can be taken by the character (and some can be taken by more than one Career Path). The Rank can be taken at this minimum Rank or at any Rank thereafter.

Once you've met all of the requirements and your GM agrees, you may select the Alternate Rank. In every case, the Alternate Rank is "swapped" for the Rank you would otherwise have taken and its Advance Scheme is exchanged for the one found in your Career's normal path. From this point onward, you have access to these Advances and may spend your xp freely on them. The Rank may also indicate some unique ability or Trait that is gained as well—apply these immediately.

Titles and Authority within the Holy Ordos

T he Inquisition is an ancient and arcane organisation made up of shifting webs of patronage, influence and power. Although titles and epithets may be awarded or simply come about naturally for individuals within the Ordos, it actually possesses few hard-cut ranks of authority. The highest is that of Inquisitor Lord, of which any sector might have only a dozen (and often less) at any one time. Below them are the Inquisitors ordinary. They are the principle agents of the Inquisition and they each hold the same notional full authority of the Holy Ordos in temporal power and influence within their own number , but in practice can differ greatly . Beneath them, and far outnumbering them, are the Acolytes, each of whom may one day aspire to higher office and may be referred to depending on their master's whims as interrogators (a title usually reserved for those senior agents headed for a rosette themselves), specialists, savants, explicators, throne agents or, more likely, simply as Acolytes.

As well as offering up a slew of new abilities and potentials, taking an Alternate Rank, "the path less travelled" so to speak, has its downsides. You may (and probably will) miss out on certain Skills and Talents, have your maximum ability with certain Skills capped-out early, or be forced to pay more xp for them. This is simply the price of diversifying your character into a new and specialised area. Your GM may allow you to still pick these missed Advancements, if appropriate, but as Elite Advances (see Elite Advances from Missed Career Ranks) during your next Career Rank.

Because taking an Alternate Rank complicates the character progression system somewhat, it is recommended for experienced players. Remember, though, that regardless of how many options you have, a finite number of xp caps your progress and this is what determines your character's Rank.

#### **E xample**

*Junt Yeager, a Guardsman character takes the Alternate Rank Malfian Bloodsworn, exchanging his usual Rank 5: Veteran for Rank 5: Bloodsworn, and fulfils the requirements listed. He doesn't cease to be a Guardsman; he is just now a Guardsman who sidelines as a murderous bounty hunter. Junt's player now has access to the Skills and Talents listed under the Bloodsworn Advances at the costs listed there, and may spend xp freely on them from this point forward. However, all this time gallivanting around bringing down recidivists for money means he misses out on certain opportunities from Guardsmen Rank 5: Veteran. When he moves onto Guardsman Rank: 6, if he wishes to still obtain these (and has the xp to spend), he must pay for them as Elite Advances.*

#### **Moving O n**

Once you have accumulated and spent enough xp to advance to the next Rank, you do so as normally. If your Career Path splits, you must choose one path as you normally would, your Alternate Rank standing in the stead of any previous choice you needed to have made. You must then follow this chosen path normally, although you may find your "tangent" has left you missing certain Skills needed as prerequisites for some of the Advances offered by the new Rank and, to acquire them, you must obtain them as Elite Advances. More likely, however, you will continue to develop your Advances from your Alternate Rank to make up for missed opportunities.

#### **Eli te Adva n c e s fro m M issed C areer Rank s**

Having taken an Alternate Rank means that your character has deviated from the regular path and, while the character will have gained new and often unique abilities from this extra-curricular activity, he misses out on what would have been his regular development. In this case, the "missed" Talents and Skills can be obtained by the character (with the GMs approval) as Elite Advances for their listed cost in the missed Rank plus 50 xp.

#### **E xample**

*Junt the Guardsman missed out on Guardsman Rank: 5 Veteran, having become a Bloodsworn bounty hunter instead. However, Junt obtained a melta gun during the course of an encounter with some hereteks and would like to become proficient in its use. Basic Weapon Training (Melta) is an Advance listed on his missing Rank, so Junt's player asks to take this as an Elite Advance. The GM agrees on the condition that the character spends sufficient downtime between adventures practicing, and allows Junt to have the Advance for 150 xp (100 for the Talent plus 50 more for the Elite Advance). The GM also charges him a chunk of Throne gelt for the cost of the ammo bottles he's used up training with the hand-cooker!*

#### <span id="page-54-0"></span>**Black Priest of Maccabeus** Black Priest of Maccabeus

*"I walk in the footsteps of the Blessed Saint Drusus and I go about the Emperor's work. At my word the unclean spirit baulks and the heretic withers in shame. Who, then, are you to stand against me?"*

— Prior Cornelius Agrippa, Maccabean Exorcist.

Known by some as the Black Clerics or the Ashen Confessors (and in secret by the more fearful nickname of "pyre-crows"), these clerics form loose-knit orders of militant priests organised at the behest of Ordo Malleus to aid them in their work. Such orders are scattered through Imperial space and, although far from common, are a tried and tested weapon in Ordo Malleus's arsenal. In the Calixis Sector, the Inquisition chose to base their Black Order on Maccabeus Quintus, an often overlooked shrine world and home to a particularly aesthetic and mystical interpretation of the Imperial Creed. It is also a world removed from the intrigues and power struggles of the sector's Ecclesiarchy politics and, therefore, perfect for their needs.

Black Priests are selected from promising candidates taken from the Ministorum's clergy and chosen for their strength of will, the power of their faith and, in many cases, by dint of survival when confronted by malefic forces in the past. The candidates are then subject to extreme levels of testing and interrogation as if they themselves where suspected heretics, a process some do not survive; those that come through this trial are trained in secret esoteric lore by their masters in Ordo Malleus. Entrusted with knowledge otherwise forbidden, even to others of the Ecclesiarchy, and taught how to focus their will and the purity of their faith to achieve extraordinary things, not least of all the castigation of Daemons, clerics who undergo the "Maccabean rites" are forever changed by the experience, and set apart from their fellows in the Ministorum by the nature of their faith and the dark and secret truths about the nature of reality they now carry. The road of a Black Priest is a hard one and rarely one long-lived, not simply because of the weight of the knowledge they carry, but because they are driven by their calling into the most dangerous of situations against the worst of foes. Most Black Priests find service with the Inquisition either in the direct retinue of a Daemon hunter, or as a specialist Acolyte operating for another Ordo, ready to bring their abilities to bear when the Daemonic is unexpectedly encountered. Should a Black Priest live long enough, it is not uncommon for them to rise to the rank of an Inquisitor Malleus themselves, if they are capable enough.

In appearance and demeanour, Maccabean Black Priests live up to their name, dressing in simple black or ashen robes, and eschewing any form of ornamentation or extravagance of appearance other than religious icons and relics—often rendered in simple iron or steel. Likewise weapons and armour are likely to be blackened with pyre ash and their manner is likely to be grim, unforgiving and humourless (although a bleak gallows wit is evident in some). They are fanatics in their cause, but, unlike the firebrand ranting of a Redemptionist, their zealotry often has the quality of cold unyielding stone and dire certainty.

#### **Becoming a Black Priest of Maccabeus**

In order to qualify for this path, the character must be a Cleric who either originates from Maccabeus Quintus, or with the permission (or at the behest) of their Inquisitorial masters is sent to train there during "downtime" between adventures. This Career Path is particularly suited to Clerics who want a more directly combative role against the powers of the warp, or who in their character's past have survived encounters with the Daemonic.

**Required Career:** Cleric.

**Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must have less than 10 Corruption Points when this career is taken. Also, you must either originate or have spent time training on Maccabeus Quintus. Note this career is not open to characters with the Mind Cleansed Origin.

# II: Calixian Careers

#### **Special: Encarta Maleficarum (Elite Advance)**

Some Black Priests, in order to aid them as holy exorcists, are subjected to a secret ritual that Ordo Malleus calls the Encarta Maleficarum. During this ritual, forbidden knowledge is burned deep into their minds, shackled with wards inscribed by occult means directly into the cerebral cortex. This procedure rare and considered a radical one even by the most ardent of Daemonhunters, as the survival rate is not high and, even if successful, the recipient's life expectancy can be seriously reduced and their sanity eroded.

The Encarta Maleficarum is treated as an Elite Advance (see page 229 of Dark Heresy). Upon spending the xp to acquire it, your character disappears for 1d5 weeks, as the Black Priests put your faith and endurance to the test and inscribe burning lore into your mind. As a result of this procedure's harmful side effects, you gain 1d5 Insanity Points and you permanently reduce your Toughness by 1d5 and your Fellowship by 1d5.

This heavy price buys fearful knowledge and armours you against the whiles of the Daemon: your character gains the Forbidden Lore (Ordo Malleus) skill and the Insanely Faithful talent. Also you gain a +10 bonus on all Tests made to resist torture and interrogation, attempts to read or control your mind and any form of possession. In addition, if an attempt to possess you does succeed, but by less than three degrees of success, the assault or intrusion is blocked by the wards within your mind—it fails and you collapse in a catatonic state for 1d10 minutes.

*"My masters regret that your harvest has failed governor and unrest stirs your little world. Perhaps you should seek assistance from the free captains as you did three years ago when you turned down our last generous offer, and with it the protection of our friendship… no? Well, unfortunately things have grown harsher in the sub-sector of late and our price now is regrettably somewhat higher…"*

Travel is a hazardous business, and foolish is the man or woman who steps unwary of the dangers away from the safety of their own, let alone seeks to travel the cold and merciless darkness between the stars. Such travel in some ways is an even more dangerous business for the powerful and wealthy of the Calixis Sector's elites, because, although insulated by their power and their followers from commonplace hardships, they often have many enemies and much to lose. The Imperium of man is a grim and deadly place; the great and the powerful must always fear the assassin's hand, as well as the intrigues, plots and machinations of their rivals. It is unsurprising that many choose to remain at the centre of their domains and, when matters of import arise that do not require their personal presence, they send others out in their stead. The Bonded Emissary is just such a person. Emissaries are, by their nature, powerful individuals, no mere messenger, trade factor or errand-runner. An Emissary speaks

with their master's voice and carries with them their master's authority (to a point). Such a trusted and delicate position requires much from the individual involved, as they must be above all, clever, socially adept and strong-willed. They must also have a mastery of the facts at hand and be aware of the subtle interplay of politics, while being wary always for the manoeuvring and plotting of their master's rivals. Some Emissaries focus on the skills of the diplomat and the negotiator, while others act mainly as agents to evaluate and acquire objects, opportunities and even people who their masters might wish to recruit. Successful Emissaries soon become recognised and valued, and win favour and power in their own right. Those that fail their employers abjectly or cause them to lose face seldom get a second chance.

In the Calixis Sector, as in much of the Imperium, Emissaries go by numerous names and titles depending on their task and their master. The Administratum has a labyrinthine series of titles and designations, from the Quastor Maximus who sits in attendance at the Lucid Palace, to the grey ranks of reeves, delagators, potentates and the innumerable sub-consuls, consuls lesser and peripatetic that shuttle between its concerns and the other branches of the Adeptus Terra and Commercia. The great trade guilds and trans-stellar cartels, such as the Skaelen-Har Hegemony and the DeVayne Corporation, have their brokers, agents and procurators to represent them. The noble houses of Scintilla, Malfi and the other major worlds have their own heralds and nuncios, and upand-coming scions that provide them with ambassadors and who maintain their presence at court. The various powers and domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus also largely depend on Emissaries chosen from the ranks of their tech-priests to interact with the wider Imperium, whose "petty" concerns and intrigues as they see them hold little interest for the Magos. The tech-priests themselves, are largely the source of some not unjustified fear, misunderstanding, and apprehension by others, and in order to overcome this difficulty and secure their desired outcomes, the ordered minds of the Mechanicus will engage a specialist to act for them.

#### **Becoming a Bonded Emissary**

Inquisitors have need of skilled individuals other than trained killers, mind-bending psykers, and dogged investigators. They often need liars and dissemblers, individuals whose perception allows them to read the subtle ebb and flow of the interplay of a noble's court, and men and women who can detect the subtle taint of madness beneath a genial façade. Emissaries are perfect for such tasks, and an Acolyte with these skills can be confidently relied upon to act as the cornerstone of any covert investigation, often with the backing of false identities and cover provided by the Holy Ordos. Those that meet them, while in one of their cover identities, rarely guess their true master unless they decide to reveal it.

**Required Career:** Adept or Tech-Priest. **Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp). **Other requirements:** Intelligence 30 and Fellowship 30.

*"Yes, you were right to call me in Lord Marshal. The runic symbols are indeed of xeno-origin, yes the dying ones… but the inscription is not in their usual form… this rune here, for example, does indicate a warning, but not against trespass as one might expect but… oh… I say…. ahem, I must consult some texts, erm, off world, very important—if my passage could be arranged quickly… perhaps now?"*

— Xeno-Arcanist Xoth Lyncarte, Prior to the loss of expedition: Seedworld-Gamma-9.

A specialised scholar in both a privileged and a dangerous position, a Xeno-Arcanist specialises in obscure lore and knowledge concerning the works of the alien. There are few sources for such knowledge, but among them are the Rogue Trader families, the explorators, and the annals of Imperial History itself, which are rife with stories of war against the aliens that have surrounded and beset mankind since time immemorial. The most exhaustive and prohibited records, however, reside in the archive of the Holy Inquisition itself and the vaults of Ordo Xenos Calixis, whose remit extends out to the very edge of explored space. These contain a veritable treasure trove of terrible knowledge and perilous artefacts from alien races known, unknown and, in some cases, deemed to be so dangerous that even use of their names is forbidden on pain of death. Such a vast wealth of fragmentary, disparate and often contradictory knowledge requires both skill and vast insight to organise and apply. For this reason, Xeno-Arcanists Acolytes are considered a necessary evil by Ordo Xenos, although, always the subject of the closest scrutiny less they succumb to the foul temptations of the alien. Some serve as cloistered academics and savants, while others are utilised as agents in the field to put their skills to more practical (if perilous) applications.

Outside the Holy Inquisition, Xeno-Arcanists hold a far more precarious position and must often conceal their knowledge to avoid persecution. Many are driven academics whose lust for knowledge outstrips any misgivings about their ultimate fate, while other Radicals believe that by studying the alien they can better learn to defeat it, or even replicate alien technology and achievements for their own ends. Some, blinded by the potential discoveries and benefits involved, are foolish enough to secretly disbelieve the Imperial doctrine that the xenos and their works are fundamentally evil. Some even live long enough to regret this misplaced conceit.

The Calixis Sector, bounded as it is by the vast and terrifying expanse of unknown space, is a place where knowledge of the alien is in high (if secret) demand, with many mercantile guilds, explorers and even noble houses, quietly circumventing

the Imperium's ban on such knowledge either through desire for profit, power, out of fear or simple, damnable curiosity. To the chagrin of Ordo Xenos, by simple virtue of the sector's location, time and exposure, many private libraries and collections on Scintilla, Malfi and other established worlds are known to hold their own xenos artefacts and secret lore although often useless or forgotten without the knowledge of how to interpret them. The Hetaireia Lexis's collections have been the source of several scandals and even a few armed raids in the past. Unsurprisingly then, a rogue Xeno-Arcanist can charge a high price for their expertise if they are willing to enter such a dangerous game. Many do so with their own agendas, some not realising until too late the true nature of those they find themselves working for.

#### **Becoming a Xeno-Arcanist**

Becoming a Xeno-Arcanist is more a matter of inclination and opportunity than anything else. Conceivably any adept in the service of the Inquisition could be tasked or driven to study the alien, particularly if, in the past, they have encountered the xenos themselves or acted as curator for xeno-lore or artefacts. This is particularly the case of adepts in the service of Inquisitors from Ordo Xenos, for whom the pursuit of the alien and the destruction of those who have truck with their works is their central quest.

**Required Career:** Adept. **Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp). **Other Requirements:** Intelligence 40.

#### <span id="page-60-0"></span>**Chaliced Commissariat Operative** Chaliced Commissariat Operative

*"They have nothing to fear—unless they have something to fear."*

> — Common saying amongst the Chaliced Commissariat.

Those who move close to those circles of power at the Lucid Palace on Scintilla, or with enough resource to pay to hear the talk of the court, know that Lord Sector Marius Hax is a savagely ambitious and paranoid figure. He despises rebels with a malice and a hatred that borders on outright madness. His determination to maintain the glorious and obedient dominion of the Emperor in the Calixis Sector—under his name of course—is worth to him any bloodshed or terror. As a man, subtle and clever, as well as brutal, since attaining his high rank, he has forged many tools to tighten his control over the sector and some have been more successful than others. One of those tools, whose success has been mixed, is the Chaliced Commissariat.

This special military unit is a direct political and military extension of the Lord Sector's will and was created to maintain direct control over locally raised regiments and PDF forces within the Calixis Sector. Feared and hated in equal measure across the sector, the mere sight of the laurel-wreathed chalice badge and deep red rank insignia are enough cause for a defence trooper to blanch and consider whether their life has come to an end.

Though Hax can see many ways in which rebellion might occur in his domain, what most concerns him is corruption among local PDF units, or worse an organised and armed secession on the part of a local planetary government, supported by its planetary defence force. The Imperium's history is littered with such revolts and Hax is not willing to let the Imperial governance in Calixis, or his personal reputation, be muddied by such occurrences. To this end, he commissioned the raising of a special military formation, modelled on the Imperial Commissariat that would draw suitable recruits from across the sector, selected for their loyalty, ambition and willingness to use any means necessary to ensure order. They would be charged with maintaining the morale and loyalty of PDF units across the sector, rooting out criminality and corruption, and ensuring that whatever local loyalties might exist, fear would override them if need be. Such "internal security commissariats" are far from unknown in the Imperium, particularly on larger hive worlds where the PDF may maintain potentially millions of men at arms, but the powers, remit and sheer brutality of Hax's force is certainly unusual, and has caused controversy and dispute among the sector's powerful elites.

Lord Marshal Gorman of the Adeptus Arbites has made no secret of his dislike for Hax's "specially selected scum", seeing them as bordering on being an unlawful agency, and therefore one step away from an instrument of rebellion themselves. The powers of the Malfian sub-sector and the notoriously independent Fenksworld always managed to keep their own PDF forces largely free of involvement through means both fair and foul. The greatest conflict,

however, has come from the true Commissariat, the arm of the Adeptus Munitorium charged with maintaining morale and order in the Imperial Guard, and whose contempt for the Chaliced forces has never been disguised. This dislike blossomed into open conflict during the Tranch Uprising when a Chaliced Commissariat unit executed an Imperial Guard detachment that retreated from their post. The senior Imperial Commissar in-theatre decreed that the Chaliced Commissariat had no authority over Imperial Guard units, and in executing the "deserters", they had committed traitorous mass-murder against the Emperor's lawful forces. On the basis of this judgement, he had every member of the Chaliced Commissariat on Tranch shot.

Since the affair on Tranch, the true Commissariat have kept the Chaliced forces from operating in active war zones to any extent—much to Hax's displeasure. To avoid further embarrassment, the Chaliced Commissariat has confined itself largely to operations within the garrisons of the Calixis Sector's core worlds and lending themselves to "policing actions" against Hax's political enemies or brutal crackdowns at the slightest provocation. It is not unknown for a PDF base to be isolated, its officers interrogated and executed and all lower ranks to be shipped off to the Ghostfire-fuelled penal legions on the basis of the merest rumour of sedition.

#### **Becoming a Soldier of the Chaliced Commissariat**

Members of the Chaliced Commissariat are not only soldiers, but ruthless figures of authority and fear within the Calixis Sector, particular on the core worlds surrounding Scintilla. This alone may make the recruitment of a member of the Commissariat attractive to an Inquisitor in need of a ruthless military-trained Acolyte. Members of the Commissariat also move freely around the sector in the execution of their duties

and have access to intelligence sources regarding political and military matters, making them excellently placed to act as hidden agents of the Ordos Calixis. Equally, having an Acolyte placed within an extension of Hax's power base may also suit an Inquisitor who suspects the Chaliced Commissariat and those in the Lord Sector's inner circle.

A character who becomes part of the Chaliced Commissariat automatically gains the Feared and Loathed trait (see sidebar).

#### **Required Career:** Guardsman.

**Required Spent Experience:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp).

#### **Feared and Loathed (Trait)**

Members of the Chaliced Commissariat act with a brutal autonomy thanks to the indulgence of Lord Sector Hax. Their elimination of seditious elements within PDF units and pitiless reputation means that members of PDF units or Imperial Guard units raised within Calixis respond with fear and deep-seated loathing to a member of the Chaliced Commissariat.

As a member of this organisation, you gain a +10 bonus on Inquiry and Intimidate Tests when used against members of the Imperial Guard or PDF. You take a –10 penalty, however, when Testing Charm or Command on the same groups.

**Note:** This Trait depends as much on the uniform, manner and bearing as anything else, and if the character is otherwise dressed, unrecognised or disguised its effects do not apply.

*"I know not what they will do to the enemy, but by the God-Emperor they terrify me!"*

— Lord Luther Kronus, on the Mortressan Sythewind Regiment.

While the unnumbered ranks of the Imperial Guard form the basis of the military might on which the Imperium is founded, they are far from a homogenised fighting force. Aside from the imposition of order and standardisation of wargear the Munitorium provides, each regiment is as individual as the world that spawns it, and often the most unique are those drawn from feral worlds. The savagery of such worlds, both in terms of the constant warfare that their primitive peoples engage in and the often deadly flora and fauna encountered there, make for excellent material for breeding men and women for whom enduring danger and conflict are second nature long before a lasgun is ever placed in their hands. In many cases, regiments raised on feral worlds (and even a few death worlds and the more unstable feudal worlds) are highly sought after by the Munitorium and represent that world's only tithe to the Imperium, such is the value placed in their fighting stock. Most of these regiments have their number heavily drilled, forcibly educated and disciplined to bring them in line with Imperial Guard tactical doctrine and practices, channelling their warlike spirits in the Emperor's service. Some, though, often the most bloodthirsty and savage examples, are allowed to hold on to much of their "old ways" (with the exception of heretical beliefs) and maintain their brutal and close-combat oriented fighting styles, as it is this very savagery and skill that is their greatest asset. In these cases, the regiment, usually employed as shock

troops and assault specialists, suffer heavy casualties in the breach of any war zone to which they are assigned, leaving behind a hard and veteran core of elite warriors that can often match the fury of the worst enemies of mankind, be they renegade, xenos or servant of the Ruinous Powers, blow-for-blow.

In the Calixis Sector there are a number of feral worlds that serve this purpose for the Departmento Munitorium, although the characteristics of each are very different. Of those worlds with large enough populations to make the raising of regiments a worthy exercise, Endrite's people are deemed true savages, a bloodthirsty and vicious lot. Intensely superstitious, they kill and maim over the slightest provocation, and place little value, it seems to outsiders, even on their own lives. Eminently expendable, Endrite "head-hunter"

regiments are quickly rounded up and thrown into the breach when needed by the Calixis Munitorium, who ensure their loyalty with a deployment of their least subtle Commissars and a sizable contingent of Imperial preachers.

Of better mettle are the famed "Sythewind" of the feral death world of Mortressa, whose Guardsmen, armed with their ever-present hand axes, make for phenomenally adept scouts and infiltrators. The Mortressan iron-tribes are some of the most renowned hunters and beast slayers in the entire sector, as befits their survival against the veritable hordes of carnosaurs and other dangerous predators that populate their world. Ever since the sector's early days, a Sythewind regiment has been maintained and continuously (if slowly) replenished, rather than re-raised, owing to the world's relatively small population, with the few surviving veterans given special dispensation to return to their home world once their duty is done. There, they form a respected ruling class of elders who pass their knowledge and wide experience down to the young hunters of their tribe, creating a culture where to be chosen for Imperial service is the highest of honours.

Aside from these famed worlds, there are others from which savage fighters are recruited as mercenaries, swear allegiance to off-world powers and are even abducted to serve as blood sport attractions for the wealthy and jaded. Fedrid, Volnox and even ill-storied Dusk have their own hard-bitten killers to offer, while the infamous strife-torn world of Iocanthos, with its long millennia of open, unmitigated conflict, offers the Ashleen technologically adept savages whose barbarity and fury often equals or exceeds the most culturally regressed and animalistic "true" feral worlder.

#### **Becoming a Feral Warrior**

Whether a former Imperial Guardsman, or a sometime mercenary who bartered his skills to leave his world of origin, a feral warrior is a fighter who, while fully trained in modern weaponry and tactics, has embraced the savage heritage within and now wields anger and the brutal gifts his background has granted as his greatest weapon. The physical power and martial skills of the feral warrior are highly valued by Inquisitors who know that to hunt down and destroy the heretic and the abomination, they need the best and most brutal fighters of their own. Feral worlders are also by their very nature survivors, able to endure the worst hardships and not baulk in the face of injury or fear. They are used to fighting and acting independently, another asset in situations where Acolytes may well find themselves outnumbered and reliant on their own resources to prevail.

#### **Required Career:** Guardsmen.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp). **Other Requirements:** You must originate from a Feral World.

#### **Beast Hunter (Talent)**

Many feral worlders were beast hunters long before they saw Imperial service. Of them, many come from cultures where, to survive their forbears, they had to become adept at bringing down the largest and most dangerous of prey. Such hard-won wisdom is rarely forgotten by their descendants.

Whenever you score a Critical Effect against a creature with a Size class of Hulking or larger, increase your Damage by +3. This does not apply to artificial constructs such as servitors, warp creatures such as Daemons, entities with the From Beyond trait, or things with a completely unrecognisable anatomy.

#### **Death Worlds**

Death worlds come in many varied forms, but each is ultimately inimical to human life. The kind that comes most readily to the Imperial mind is covered in a steaming endless jungles teaming with hostile life, such as infamous Mortressa in the Calixis Sector, although, they are just as likely to be ash-strewn volcanic wastelands, or planets ravaged by terrible nuclear holocausts or where ancient and virulent diseases run unchecked and unstoppable. Such worlds are almost impossible to colonise, but often, through abandonment or sheer bloody-mindedness, humanity has managed to survive there in limited numbers despite the odds. The battle for survival is only won at the cost of civilisation in many cases, with most human native populations sunk to the level of feral hunter-gatherers.

Some Death worlds are inhabited regardless of the risk owing to the presence of valuable resources, or held at all costs for strategic reasons. One such world is Haddrak on the edge of the Adrantis Nebula, a world where vast sulphurous seas have poisoned the land and acid storms driven by hurricane-force winds can strip flesh from bone in moments. Yet even on Haddrak life endures. Here the Adeptus Mechanicus of the Sollex sect are based, drawn to the world by its unique crystalline deposits, their black basalt fortress stabs up through to burning skies like a clawed hand. Life, needless to say, for the unfortunates born, stationed or shipped to a death world is unutterably hard and perilous, and almost without exception only those strong both in body and mind survive.

#### <span id="page-64-0"></span>**Legate Investigator** Legate Investigator

*"Did you receive the heretics into your company? Did you swear to them any service? Did you, knowing that they are the foulest of traitors, aid them by deliberate act, by tolerating their presence, or by the sin of silence when knowing of heresy?"*

— from the Blessed Rituals of Inquiry, Volume IX.

Heresy is most skilled at hiding its face from those who would find it out and persecute it. Conspiracies, cults and false creeds hide themselves behind layers of petty crime, local prejudices, crude fakery, false rumour and seeming foolishness, as well as more labyrinthine plots and intricate layers of well-crafted lies and deceit. Cutting through these distractions to find the truth, no matter how deeply buried, is the trade of the Legate Investigator.

Fully ranked Inquisitors of the Holy Ordos are rare individuals, and in large inquiries or full-scale purges they must often delegate the minutiae of sifting through detail, and the questioning under duress of hundreds, sometimes thousands of suspects to others in their retinue—tasks for which the Legate is exhaustively trained. Gifted with a special seal of authority for the duration of a particular enquiry, these Legates are variously called "cult breakers", "hounds", and "brothers of question" by their fellows in the Ordos Calixis. If an Acolyte makes a particular success of their time as a legate, it is popularly viewed as a sign that the recipient may be headed for an Inquisitorial rosette themselves one day.

The use of Legate Investigators is common amongst Inquisitors, a tradition within the Ordos Calixis since before its formal foundation. To be invested as a Legate is to receive a portion of the power of an Inquisitor, though in a strictly limited and defined form based upon the enquiry they are involved in and for a very limited duration. Such powers usually extend to command authority over local law enforcement, detention, requisition and question, but rarely much further. When an investigation is complete, the authority of the Legates involved is formally ended.

Despite the potential for advancement in the role, some Acolytes see Legates as unfortunate drudges used by their master to plough through tedious months of interrogations and mountains of interminable records, only to find that there is nothing beyond the most minor criminal activity present. Other unfortunates are left to clean up endless loose threads after the main thrust of their Inquisitor's wrath has been expended and they themselves have moved on. This view does have some basis as the Ordos Calixis do invest and dispatch Legates where Inquisitorial involvement is being demanded, but thought largely unnecessary by the higher authority. Some Inquisitors invest Legates and dispatch them on an investigation simply to stir up what may be lurking beneath the mud, using them as literal and open bait to draw heresy and dark forces out into the open—obviously, this last task is far from popular with the Acolytes in question. More subtle Inquisitors use legates to give formal weight to a largely covert operation, knowing that their Acolytes will have access to greater resource without having to wait on petitions to local authority or constantly having to refer back to higher powers.

The granting of even a fraction of the absolute authority of an Inquisitor, even closely defined as in this case, is a very serious matter indeed, only ever entrusted to the most promising and able of Acolytes, and often to candidates who have successfully performed such a role before. Failure or misuse of such an office also holds the distinct prospect of censure and harsh punishment.

#### Secret Tongues and Hidden Ciphers of the Ordos Calixis

The Inquisition has many secrets to hide and many subtle and terrifying tools with which to preserve them. One layer of secrecy comes from the thousands of coded languages and cipher methods used by its servants. Here are but a few of the tongues, ciphers and codes used within the Ordos Calixis.

#### Augustinian

Created by an Inquisitor of a neighbouring sector, this simple series of phrases and pictograms has wide use throughout the Segmentum Obscurus and is part of the so-called Augustine Protocols, a set of Inquisitorial practices and training methods dating back at least four millennia. Augustinian uses phrases and simple hand drawn pictograms to stand for particular situations or threats. "Lidless brother", for example, means "you are under surveillance by other agents of the Inquisition" and can be said, written or represented by its pictogram of a crude eye with a diagonal slash across it.

#### Cryptos Cognos

A relatively recent addition to the canon of Inquisitorial codes, this subtle means of covert communication is based not only on phrases, but voice cadence, inflection and accompanying body language. Exclusively used by graduates of the secretive Tenebrae Collegium, it is so subtle that even sharp-eyed observers could see and hear an entire conversation held on some seemingly innocuous subject and be completely unaware of what was truly being said.

#### The Gimel Progression

Aside from the standard Imperial and Inquisitorial codes, the Ordos Calixis use an ultra-high security cipher for transmissions sent via astropathic chorus, courier and vox. The Gimel Progression varies in security depending on the importance of the message with the lowest being Gimel-Ardent, progressing to Gimel-Amethyst, and finally Gimel-Obsidian. The Gimel sequences are based on seemingly random substitution code words based on a rotating encryption rumoured to consist of all ten thousand volumes of the Codex Administratum and several other noteworthy texts.

#### The Nephilim Cipher

There are some records that are not just secret but dangerous to any that would access them. For such material, a cipher that is not only unbreakable but can also bind what it is used to code is needed. The Nephilim Cipher is one such cipher. It is based on sacred mathematical translations and ancient symbols of binding, most commonly employed to encode material relating to the nature of Daemons and the warp. Legend has it that this code dates back to the very founding of the Holy Ordos.

#### The Tantalus Fractal

Highly unusual, the Tantalus Fractal is a tech-code, a construction of binary incantations and data-djinn locked one on top of another in seven-dimensional formula with potentially infinite combinations and deadlocks. The Tantalus is used by the highest-ranking tech-priests in the service of the Inquisition to encrypt the most dangerous of data, often referring to blasphemous works of tech-heresy and xenos artifice. It is said that the Tantalus holds numerous hidden traps within its makeup more than capable of overloading and destroying cogitators and driving mad or even killing savants attempting to unlock its secrets.

#### **Bearing The Sigil of Question**

All Legate Investigators bear a formal carta of inquiry (their Legature) and a Sigil of Question that demonstrates their remit and authority under the Ordos Calixis. These two things are proof of their authority and status. The first is a document that states the locale of investigation and the focus of concern, granting the bearer the absolute right to question and examine who or whatsoever they wish on presentation and corroboration of a Sigil of Inquiry. The Sigil of Inquiry is an icon made of silver featuring the sign of a chalice engraved with the symbol of the Inquisition. It may be worn as a medallion, carried in a wallet or worn on the finger as a ring, and contains within it a code-key system for verification and secure data-access if needed.

#### **Becoming a Legate Investigator**

Becoming a Legate Investigator is as much about acknowledgement of capability and potential by an Acolyte's Inquisitorial masters as it is a willingness or want on the part of the player or character. The opening up of this Career Rank to one or more members of a group of Acolytes may be a form of reward by the GM for a deftly accomplished mission or successful campaign, or some similar accomplishment. Chiefly, this career shows that a character is both trusted and viewed as capable by their superiors. Whether they live up to such trust is in the player's hands.

Once this Rank has been taken, the character has permanent access to its Advance Scheme, although the Legate's authority only applies for the length of a particular enquiry or mission within the game.

**Required Career:** Adept, Arbitrator, Cleric, Guardsman, or Imperial Psyker.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must have the Literacy skill. In addition, you can only select this Alternate Rank if your Inquisitor offers it to you.

#### <span id="page-66-0"></span>**Malfian Bloodsworn** Malfian Bloodsworn

*"Now be a nice gent and come here and bleed on this warrant for me, eh? Then I'll make it quick for ye, otherwise I'll get a bit put out, and well… I hate swabbing the floor and getting nice parchment dirty. Seems so… undignified like."*

— Auric Kenge, Chartered Bloodsworn.

The Blood Guild of Malfi is one of the most infamous organisations of bounty hunters and man-trackers in the whole sector. It owes its origins to some long forgotten internecine war in Malfi's history of vendetta and civil infighting—a history that far predates Malfi's "liberation" during the Angevin Crusade. The Blood Guild has long served to track down, apprehend or slaughter fugitives whose warrants have been issued by the Malfian Senate. The members of the guild, the Bloodsworn as they are called, are professionals, the best it is said that money can buy at their craft, and drafted from the ranks of hardened ex-guardsmen, disgraced Arbites, outcast armsmen from the noble houses and all manner of killers and gunfighters come up from the underhive the hard way. This broad church operates only one rule—a warrant must be carried out scrupulously, but it doesn't matter what methods are used. The Bloodsworn owe little loyalty to each other either. Indeed several guild members might seek to execute the same lucrative warrant, and such often lethal "competition" is actively encouraged in the guild as a means of weeding out those not up to the standards of the guild's reputation—not that simple attrition doesn't take care of this anyway.

Most blood warrants are aptly named, issued in the form of a tough parchment scroll bearing the seal of the authorising body and carrying within it a gene-lock circuit amulet designed to identify the victim by their blood

when spilled over it. The execution of these warrants requires the subject's termination, or, more rarely, his capture for trial. Some warrants may add further gruesome specifics to the discharge notice. The returning of the bloodstained warrant results in payment drawn on Malfi's own Obsidian Chancellery. Falsifying such a warrant in some way is a dire matter indeed, and immediately results in a blood-price of truly staggering p r o p o r t i o n s being placed on the head of the malefactor by the guild.

As a part of Malfi's often impenetrable legal code and endemic culture of vendetta, a holder of a Bloodsworn Charter has certain rights above that of a mere common hired gun. The warrant enables them to bear arms in the hive where others would not, access to legal record, enter private dwellings, and even avoid interference (largely) from local enforcers and armsmen in pursuit of their warrants. These powers have their limits, however, and any Bloodsworn had better be wary of just who's property they trample on or in whose territory they operate unless they wish to find an abrupt and bloody end. Nor do their customary rights extend to the holdings or persons of the Adepta or Malfi's rulers, not that many would be so foolish.

Once confined to the continent spanning hives of Malfi, the Bloodsworn are recognised across the Malfian sub-sector and, for the right price, there is nowhere the Bloodsworn won't track down their prey regardless, a fact that has spread their infamy across the sector and beyond. The Bloodsworn are afforded a fearful respect throughout the Calixis Sector, and quite aside from their quasi-legal role as bounty hunters, many also turn their hands to assassination, bodyguard and mercenary work if the chance arises, relying on their skills and reputation to set a high price for their services.

Many Inquisitors are not above hiring members of the Bloodsworn into their own service for obvious reasons, and some even back their Acolytes to become Bloodsworn to take advantage of the cover it can provide during their covert operations, to say nothing of the contacts and even revenue gained.

#### **Becoming a Member of the Blood Guild of Malfi**

Becoming part of the Blood Guild is deceptively simple: the candidates must make their way to one of the guild's charter houses on the worlds of the Malfian sub-sector, offer payment of a thousand Throne gelt, and, as long as they themselves are not under subject to warrant and are not subject to "higher oath", they are given a "grey warrant" to execute. Grey warrants are those that have languished uncollected on the charter house's books for some time, usually because the money offered doesn't merit the danger involved in the collection. To become Bloodsworn, all they need to is successfully claim the warrant by any means necessary (which can include the help of others and might form a small adventure for the Player Characters). Once successful, the candidate must then swear a blood oath to

abide by the guild's rule. The candidate is given a guild symbol as credential and is entered on the charter list. They may then claim the right to the title of "Bloodsworn" and execute lawful warrants as long as they survive to do so.

**Required Career:** Assassin or Scum, and Guardsmen or Arbitrators who are no longer in overt Imperial service. **Alternate Rank:** 5 or higher (3,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** Must gain a charter from the Blood Guild of Malfi.

"…++CORPUS FINIS+MACHINA MAGNUS+ SANCTUS METALLUM+POTESTAS OMNISSIAH, OMNISSIAH VULT+DEATH TO THE ENEMIES OF THE MACHINE GOD++CORPUS FIN…"

— Repeating transmission, overwhelming all signal channels. The annihilation of House Caloclast, Hive Tarsus.

Although all initiates of the Machine God are versed to some extent in conflict and the skills of warfare, certain Mechanicus sects and military formations exist to study the art of destruction with the ardent fervour that their fellows might apply to the creation of machinery or the recovering of lost technoarcana. Chief among these in the Calixis Sector are the forces of the Auxilia Myrmidon, also known by some as the siege engineers or war-savants. Legend has it they came to the sector during the earliest days of the Angevin Crusade for reasons of their own, and have since remained to defend the Cult Mechanicus's possessions here. Myrmidons are expert killers, weapon masters and destroyers. At the behest of the ruling Archmagos of the Forge Worlds, they are sent to accompany explorators in investigating finds in the most dangerous sectors of space and retrieve the most hazardous xenos-specimens, while others are tasked to hunt down renegades accused of the foulest techno-heresies and terminate them with extreme prejudice.

Tech-priests who devote themselves to battle are often inducted into one of the militant sects as their knowledge and prowess increases over time, either through their own application or the will of their distant Archmagos masters. The first rank of the Mechanicus militant is the Secutor, an ancient designation believed to date back, like much of the Auxilia's organisation and secrets, to the armed forces of the Mechanum of Mars in distant pre-Imperial antiquity. It is a fact that only adds to their mystery and makes them a subject for some concern to those in the Adepta whose arcane knowledge stretches to understand what this implies. Certainly this conclusion is backed-up by the ancient and terrifying weapons, relics of that distant past which they are known to sometimes employ.

Within the Calixis Sector, the undisputed centre of the Auxilia Myrmidon's power is the Lathe System and its vast forge network, and in particular their heavy fortified arsenal and base on the city-sized panopticon orbital station. From this mustering ground, the relatively few Myrmidons are dispatched in small bands to oversee the defences of the Mechanicus's domains, seek out and destroy their enemies. The Myrmidons, although largely independent, are closely linked to the Archmagos of the Lathes, who is one of their guarantors of their dominance.

They are not, however, the only militant Mechanicus faction in the sector, and over the last century a highly mystical tech-sect based at the forge facilities on the death world of Haddrak in the northern rim of the Adrantis Nebula has grown to prominence and increasing power. The Divine Light of Sollex, as they call themselves, are zealots in the Machine God's cause, as coldly fanatic and savage in their way as any Redemptionist of the Imperial Creed. To them, the preservation of the arcane mysteries of the Machine Cult from those who would misuse them

# II: Calixian Careers

are of far greater worth than petty wealth, worldly power or the lives of their fellow men, or even other members of the Cult Mechanicus.

Towering figures of steel shrouded in blood-red robes and bedecked in hardpoint, mounted weaponry of arcane manufacture, the Myrmidons and other tech-priests militant are war makers whose knowledge of the arts of siege craft, weaponry and devastation is without peer. Although few in number, they are baleful opponents to face in battle. Heavily augmented, they are relentless, implacable, and the most powerful among them are all but impossible to kill. Myrmidons are held in no little fear and awe by other members of the Machine Cult, and have commonly subjected themselves to cybernetic reconstruction far beyond enginseers or precepts.

You can find more information on the Mechanicus, their domains and their arms of war in Chapter V. Additionally, membership of the sect of the Divine Light of Sollex is available as an optional starting Background Package as detailed in Chapter I.

#### Increase your Strength and Toughness Characteristics by +10 each and reduce your Agility and Fellowship both by –5. You now also weigh around three times as much as a normal person of your size and you may no longer swim.

You also suffer a –10 to Move Silently Tests. Thanks to your additional augmetics any Ballistic Mechadendrite you possess may mount a single Pistol weapon or one-handed Melee weapon rather than the usual compact laser design (you must have the appropriate Talent to use it).

**\*Machinator Array (Talent)**

The tech-priest's cyber-mantle and potentia coil have been further upgraded to handle more powerful loads and heavy gear, as well as armour their vital organs against damage and reinforce their limbs to support the extra weight. This has an effect of increasing the Secutor's size and bulk somewhat and adding to their strength and durability.

#### **Becoming a Mechanicus Secutor**

Some tech-priests are drawn to the path of the Secutor through a fascination with the unique and intellectual challenges warfare provides, while others feel themselves drawn to the intricacies and beauties of creation and destruction, or the sacred art of weaponsmithing. Others simply see this path as a means to an end, either for the protection of the Machine Cult, the furtherance of their own independent researches, or some other, hidden agenda. Regardless of their vocation, a tech-priest skilled in such destructive arts as the Secutor is an invaluable ally for an Inquisitor, and makes for a singularly lethal Acolyte. The only downside to such an association is that the Holy Ordos can never be fully sure where the tech-priest Secutor's loyalties lie—even more so than others of their kind—or what ancient and dark secrets they may themselves possesses.

It is likely, as you spend xp on this Alternative Career, your character will advance several Ranks in the Tech-Priest Career Path. While doing so, you can use the following titles for your Mechanicus Secutor character within the Machine Cult instead of the standard ones listed for the Tech-Priest Career if you wish. After taking these Alternate Ranks, it's best to follow the path of the Technomancer on the Career Progression Table described in Dark Heresy, if you have not yet reached the point of division on the path.

| Rank | Name            | XP            |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| 4    | Secutor         | 2,000–2,999   |
| 5    | Myrmidon        | 3,000–5,999   |
| 6    | Centurius       | 6,000–7,999   |
| 7    | Tribune/ Magnus | 8,000–9,999   |
| 8    | Magos Militant  | 10,000–14,999 |
|      |                 |               |

**Required Career:** Tech-Priest.

**Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp). Other Requirements: WS 35, BS 35, WP 35, any four Weapon Training talents.

Standard Template Constructs

The Adeptus Mechanicus is driven by the quest for knowledge. This quest takes many forms, including research and exploration, but its ultimate embodiment is the search for ancient Standard Template Construct (STC) systems.

These were created during the Dark Age of Technology to provide all the technical information needed to construct anything that settlers might need. Even the least technically accomplished person could build a vehicle, aircraft or weapon given time. One result of the STC system and its pivotal place in human colonisation is that human material culture is very similar, even on worlds which are many thousands of light years apart.

Today there are no known surviving STC systems and only a very few examples of first-generation texts. For thousands of years the Adeptus Mechanicus has pursued all information about the STC. Any scrap of information is eagerly sought out and jealously hoarded. Any rumour of a functional system is followed up and investigated in force.

#### <span id="page-72-0"></span>**Metallican Gunslinger** Metallican Gunslinger

*"They say he's fast, like chain lightning fast. I don't believe 'em, no one's that fast."*

— Last words attributed to Kail Strom, bounty hunter, deceased.

The Gunslingers of Gunmetal City on Scintilla are the finest in the sector, the most infamous and the most lethal. In action, they are a blazing whirl of muzzle flashes, their hands so fast that their pistols seem mere extensions of their murderous will, and all around them people die. This is the craft of the Gunslinger, be they gang enforcers, famed arena champions or grim wanderers, a Metallican Gunslinger is worth the price if killing is involved. The Scintillan hive of Gunmetal adores the gun and honours above all others those who forge or wield them with great skill. With every man, woman or child packing at least one piece of cold iron, when a Metallican is said to be a skilled gunman, it is a stone cold truth, as they have managed to elevate themselves above a thousand others to be so named.

Among the ferocious gangs of the lower Infernis regions of the hive, one's choice of weapon, and skill with it, is a matter of gang honour, pride and renown and there are bewildering array of gunmen. Some consider a single shot kill the most sublime, honing their skills to become snipers the equal of any Guard veteran, while others prefer to be bedecked in weapons, spraying shells with wild abandon, knowing that they always have a backup piece should they hear that dreadful empty click. Others pay for crude grafts of slab muscle so they can heft the heaviest weapons crafted in the hive's fanes and forges. But above all in underworld status and popular myth are the Gunslingers, the duellists, the pistol fighters—they are the true embodiment of Gunmetal in all its deadly glory.

Most fine Gunslingers are undoubtedly from the gangs of the Infernis. In the scalding hot deeps, duels between gangs' finest pistol wielders are used to settle matters of reproach or insult between rivals (short of a full-blown gang war), and anyone who even thinks about using their pistol around an Infernis gang had better know how to use it. It is in this deadly crucible that the Gunslinger is made. While most Gunslingers find employ with the gangs, not an inconsiderable number find more legal employment as "Regulators", hired muscle for the fanes and forges that are the true power in Gunmetal City. Some may take employ as high-priced bodyguards and others (often short-lived) as attractions seeking fame and fortune in the mid-hive arenas, depending on their skills to keep them alive before the baying crowd. The hivers and underhivers of Gunmetal City are not alone in their reverence of the Gunslinger's art. Noble-born duellists, so called "gunrakes", prowl the upper hive reaches in search of slights against their honour so they may exercise their skill on a living target. A few of the boldest gunrakes venture into the Infernis to test the true extent of their skill. A few even survive.

Though they all are dedicated to the deadly way of the pistol, Gunslingers are as different as the finely crafted weapons they wield. Some crave the renown and respect granted to the most infamous of their kind. The precision-crafted pistols gifted by a famous fane, the tremor and awe their name inspires, and the hush that descends on a room when they walk in are the finest things life can offer to them. Others are products of a freakish fusing of madness, flamboyance and skill, deadly strutting peacocks festooned with holstered weapons, as quick to flash a smile and make a mocking aside

as they are to slaughter a room full of people. If, however, you ask an Infernis ganger what is the most dangerous breed of Gunslinger, they are sure to tell you it is those who have seen too much, lived too long, killed too many, haunted, empty men and women with dead eyes, who say little, seem to drift aimless and alone, and can kill you before you even see them move. This cold breed of wanderers are the fear of even the deadliest ganger, and the most prized, if quixotic, of hired guns. They are the pale death, patient and inevitable waiting

#### **Becoming a Metallican Gunslinger**

for all who follow the way of the gun.

Becoming a Gunslinger from Gunmetal City is a matter of desire and skill and is an excellent choice for a character seeking to be the epitome of brutal Gunmetal City itself. You may start play having already set on this course or come to it as your career develops. Inquisitors are likely to find a Gunslinger's destructive skills useful, but do be warned you are not alone in your adoration of the pistol's dance, and your showy demonstrations of skill may cause your master as many problems as it solves; that and, if you survive to became truly skilled, others may see you as a means to prove themselves. Infamy after all does have a price. When you become a Metallican Gunslinger, you automatically gain the Knave of Pistols trait, which imposes limitations on your character.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (o xp).

Note this means you may opt to specify this at character creation as your Advance Scheme. This does not affect your basic starting Skills and Talents, only how and on what you can spend your starting xp.

**Other Requirements:** BS 30 and you must also have Gunmetal City as your Home World.

#### **Knave of Pistols (Trait)**

Metallican Gunslingers are notoriously proud of their skill with pistols and eschew all other ranged weapons. With this Trait, you may not acquire new Basic or Heavy Weapon Training talents and may only take Exotic Weapon Training for pistols. If you already have training in ranged weapons that are not pistols, you may still use these Talents, but you take a –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests.

#### **Moritat Reaper** Moritat Reaper

*"I never saw the killer fully, though I thank the Saviour-Emperor for her. We'd lost half the squad and Proctor Aeldred had just gone down with his throat bit open. I fired off the last round from my Puritan and had nothing left but my boot knife and a prayer on my lips when this dark shape dropped from the gantry above. The carrionates, well, the rotted things just came apart, black clotted blood and rancid flesh everywhere. The one in front of me went down in five twitching chunks and I swear I didn't see a single sword stroke fall… a miracle sir. The Emperor's own bloody work—like a death angel from the old hive tales."*

— Deputy Provost Morcar, Report on the Morningside Incident, Hive Gloriana.

The Moritat are an ancient Imperial Death Cult devoted to the art of the blade and their own dark and bloody interpretation of the Imperial Creed. The Moritat's membership view themselves as a sect of assassin-mystics in service ultimately of the God-Emperor Himself, and deem their killings divinely licensed, if not directly ordained. In the Moritat's dogma (as it is with many death cults), blood holds a sacred place: it represents both beating life and the shed blood of the countless millions who have been martyred so humanity can continue to exist. Particularly, it embodies the sacrifice of the Emperor Himself. For the Moritat, then, there is no more sacred act than the spilling of blood and for this reason they prefer to do their work with the edge of the blade over any other implement of death.

Their secret rituals revolve around blood and, to them, no lesson is truly learned and no truth uncovered without bloodshed to mark its moment. Central to the Moritat's doctrine and training is the "travail", the processes of struggle and lethal combat making up the course of their lives and serving to hone their skills. During this time, the Moritat makes their way as a contracted assassin, often only for a nominal fee or a bizarre or symbolic item of payment, or, just as often, as a murderer who seeks out worthy targets among those skilled enough to prove challenging or who they regard as the Emperor's foes—heretics, mutants, cultists and witches, although a particular Moritat has his or her own favoured targets. Many Moritat find service with the Holy Ordos during this period as the goals of the Inquisition and the Moritat's chosen victims marry well together. The sanction of Inquisitorial authority often serves to cover up the assassin's less orthodox habits. The Moritat assassin is watched in secret by members of their own cult throughout the travail and once their superiors deem they have grown sufficiently skilled enough, they are initiated into the cult's higher mysteries, becoming a thing of whispered legend—a Moritat Reaper.

A Moritat Reaper is a vision of death incarnate with a blade, skilled to an extent that few can match: agile, fanatical and merciless. They are also patient, capable of waiting still for hours in the shadows or stalking their prey for days before choosing the right moment to strike. Once unleashed in combat, they erupt in savage grace, their blades leaping, slashing and severing with seemingly wild abandon, belying the consummate precision with which their bloodletting is driven. Once drenched in the blood of their victims, only then is a Moritat satiated and offers up thanks to the Emperor in silent prayer in his or her own cult's tongue, laced, it is said, with a million metaphors of death.

II: Calixian Careers

The services of a Moritat Reaper as an Acolyte is a highly valuable commodity in the Holy Ordos of the Calixis Sector, particularly with those who prefer their killings and purges to take the shape of precisely orchestrated strikes and assassinations over public witch hunts and storm trooper raids.

#### **Becoming a Moritat Reaper**

To become a Moritat Reaper, you must have been created with the option of the Moritat Assassin Background Package, (see Chapter I), and this Career choice is designed to be a culmination of that that Origin and choice. Over the course of your adventures, you must also stay true to the Moritat's dogma and defeat several of the cult's favoured enemies in single combat with the edge of the blade.

#### **Required Career:** Assassin.

**Required Experience:** Rank 6: Death Adept or higher (6,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must be a member of the Moritat and remain true to that Death Cult's code.

#### **The Reaping (Talent)**

The deadly fighting arts of the Moritat teach a special manoeuvre only made possible by their near preternatural skill with a blade, allowing one great devastating cut with which several opponents can be despatched in a great effusion of sacred blood.

By taking a Full Action in combat while using a sword or similarly edged weapon, you can make a single attack against every eligible target in close combat with you. You declare which target you attack first and then move in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction (your choice) making an attack against each target in turn. Test Weapon Skill and roll Damage separately. These attacks can be Parried or Dodged as normal, but if an attack is successfully Parried, the Reaping blow is stopped and you can make no further attacks.

*"Tranters, primes, 'lthic cells, hand rippers, I can get 'em all, reconditioned and good as new—even a batch of good slaught. Great wheel o' the steel god crush me if it's not so… The price? Let's not quibble about the price. You see, I know this up-hive guilder rolling in gelt and he needs a little intel you may have the knowing of yourself…"*

— Obadiah Plex, Hive Magnogorsk Reclaimator.

Technology is a thing little understood and its workings lie shrouded in mystery and superstition for most of humanity. The Adeptus Mechanicus holds undisputed rights to the secret lore of science and technology, but the tech-priests themselves are comparably few in number and particularly set against the teeming billions of the hive worlds or the isolated crews of ships plying the void. Such people rely on technological infrastructure in great profusion simply to live, be it a hive water-recyk system or a ship's thermal heaters. The ongoing low-grade maintenance of such petty systems, along with the day-to-day workings of the more sophisticated parts of a manufactora's machinery and the like are left to an army of technomats, functionaries, duct-crawlers, voidwalkers and work-prefects gifted by their Mechanicus masters with just sufficient knowledge to perform their tasks with due deference and supplication to the machine-spirits and nothing more.

Of this disparate group, arguably the most skilled and certainly least trusted are the Reclaimators. It is their task to redeem raw materials from old and damaged systems, to scavenge parts and be tasked with the endless cycle of minor repairs needed to keep a ship flying or a hive's infrastructure from collapsing under its own weight. By necessity, a Reclaimator's skills begin to stray into a higher understanding of machinery and technology than most and many learn to worship the Machine God in a fragmentary and superstitious manner, marking them apart from others. Added to which, the Reclaimators themselves are often sent in to dangerous or unsafe areas with little direct supervision, and they scavenge and salvage a good deal more than their masters know. As a result, most Reclaimators have a well-deserved reputation as suspicious, shifty characters who sell their skills and the items they retrieve or repair for a good profit on the black market. Many have links to criminal gangs and more than a few are willing to resort to robbery and even murder to build up their spoils if they think they can get away with it.

In the Calixis Sector, Reclaimators are common in the reaches of the hive-cities of Scintilla, Malfi and other worlds, as well as, serving on the great Chartist vessels and numerous small trader ships. Despite their vital purpose, rarely, however, do they enjoy a good reputation, although in some places their ill-renown is more deserved than others. In the depth of the Sibellus underhive, it is well organised networks of hereteks and "reks" that are the real power behind the infamous narcogangs. On war-ravaged Tranch, the men and women who make up the numerous Reclaimator scav-packs that prowl the ruins are often little more than murderous bandits weighed down by dead men's plunder and broken trinket-fetishes. Among the void born it is no different; the wreaker crews

# The Path of the Tech -Heresy

The most gifted and reckless Reclaimators learn too much, either through acquiring knowledge forbidden to them through stealing data, by daring the tech-heresy of invention, or the blasphemy of reverse-engineering. In doing so they become something far worse, they become "hereteks". Subject to the harshest of penalties under law and the wrath of the Cult of the Machine God, hereteks are outlaws who use their skills to arm and equip criminal gangs and even cults and mutant renegades, as well as supply the underhive with a wealth of illegal drugs and forbidden technology for profit, or more rarely to fund their own dangerous experiments. The more common hereteks and those that pursue other, rarer tech-heresies such as the creation of artificial sentience (or the Silica Animus as the Machine Cult names it), illegal bio-constructs and xenos-technology, are subject not only to punishment by Imperial law and the persecution of the Holy Ordos, but also bring down the wrath of the Cult Mechanicus itself. Of those that pursue such anathema in the Calixis Sector, most notable are several militant sects of the Mechanicus such as the Myrmidon Secutors and the Divine Light of Sollex, both of whom care little for legal process or collateral damage.

In one place in the sector, perhaps perversely, the Reclaimator is held in high esteem, and that place is Volg. In this most nightmarish of hives, the Reclaimator's knowledge is a vital part of sustaining life against the myriad hazards the hivers must struggle against on a daily basis. Given very little to work with in the city's environs, the Reclaimators of Volg have a reputation for coming up with nearly miraculous (if often crazed and dangerous) solutions to keep things running, and ever more inventively salvage weapons to drive away the bloated things crawling up from below. Some point to their unusual designs and the local worship of a debased form of the Machine God by the Reclaimators in the shape of "Ironskull" as evidence of the influence of rogue tech-priests exiled to Volg as punishment in times past.

#### **Becoming a Reclaimator**

Hive and void born Scum with a technically-minded bent, or those who fancy themselves as dealmakers and traders often start their careers as technomats and

Reclaimators before focusing on more "lucrative" work. While for those born in the iron canyons of a forge world's macro-industry, the path of the Reclaimator and perhaps ultimately the heretek is a natural one to follow. Likewise, the Inquisition sees them as a useful resource. Often a cut above their kind in terms of intelligence, a Reclaimator can make an excellent agent for infiltrating criminal gangs, contacting cult groups and passing unobserved through the hive and underhive, while their void born brethren are just as useful aboard ship or working orbitals and dockyards.

Regardless, it is wise for an Acolyte with such abilities and history to avoid too many entanglements and questions from the Mechanicus, or they run the risk of being labelled a heretek and suffer a fate even the sanction of the Holy Ordos might not save them from.

#### **Required Career:** Scum.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (o xp).

**Note:** This means you may opt to specify this at Character Creation as your Advance Scheme. Selecting this Alternate Rank does not affect your basic starting Skills and Talents; it only affects where you spend your starting xp.

**Other Requirements:** Int 30 and you must be from a Hive World, Forge World or Void Born Origin.

# <span id="page-78-0"></span>II: Calixian Careers

#### **Sister Oblatia** Sister Oblatia

*"If I must die, I shall welcome Death as an old friend, and wrap mine arms around it."*

— Oath of the Penitent.

For some sisters of the Sororitas, the desire to atone overwhelms them and they take up the oath of the penitent. To become a penitent is to throw aside any thoughts of advancement, self, or any lesser oaths of duty and to seek absolution through a glorious, martyr's death, willingly exiling themselves from their Order and any remaining ties to life in doing so. To their peers these penitent sisters are at once outcasts and revered as something sacred—pilgrims on a hard and noble quest at the end of which shines the pure light of the Emperor's grace. The most famed examples of those undergoing the oath of the penitent are the Sisters Repentia, who, through extreme self-inflicted suffering and the corporal mortification of their flesh, achieve a great and holy rage, hurling themselves with wild frenzy upon the enemies of the faithful, killing in a state of grace until they finally fall.

There are, however, other variations of the penitent's oath, rarer and more unusual but in their way no less remarkable. Once such is the oath of the Sister Oblatia: the oath of willing sacrifice for the sins of another. A sister who takes up this oath seeks not to atone for some direct misdeed of their own, but through profound spiritual conviction to take on the weight of another's sins, most commonly a blood relative, some infamous ancestor or stain on their family line, or, more rarely, for the past transgression of a friend, a people, or a whole world. Although she seeks ultimate atonement by the manner of her death, the onus on her is to atone through her deeds, most specifically in defeating humanities' great enemies—combating and defeating the heretic, the mutant, the witch and the alien without regard to self, injury or hardship. Through the Oblatia's battles, victories and ultimately the manner of their death, they hope to gain for the object of their sacrifice some measure of forgiveness in the Emperor's eyes.

Oblatia are accorded a respectful distance and honoured place in the prayers of their fellow Sororitas. Like the Repentia, they are viewed as pilgrims on a dark and lonely road, but at the end of which lies a shining goal. The Oblatia themselves often seem mercurial compared to other Sororitas, quick to righteous anger, stubborn, independent and brought to a life of endless wandering in search of the foe. Many are led on by the signs and portents of the Emperor's will and others by the divination of His sacred Tarot. Others gravitate towards rumours of corruption, war zones, and places of ill renown. Many, however, find service in the retinues of the Holy Inquisition, where their desire for righteous battle tallies all too well with the Inquisitor's path. But to the Inquisitors who readily employ their zealous fanaticism and undoubted skills to the Imperial Creed, comes the knowledge that their oath comes before any other vow or loyalty.

#### **Becoming a Sister Oblatia**

Most Oblatia come to their vows through spiritual revelation or after deep meditation of the nature of their holy vocation, although some few may have the oath in mind as the central cause of becoming Sororitas in the first place. Regardless of reason, only fully ordained Sisters may take the oath, and they must go before a specially convened synod of their superiors who judge the oath's validity and purity of intent, to ensure it owes nothing to hubris or vanity. The Oblatia must then undergo ritual fasting, mortification, and a symbolic severance from her life and Order before taking up the blade and making her vows before the God-Emperor; turning her back on her Sisters as a requiem mass is sung for her as if she were already dead. Most Sister Oblatia come from the ranks of the Orders Militant, but it not unknown for others to undertake the oath, often choosing to put their particular skills to lethal use in tracking down and defeating the enemies of the faith.

**Required Career:** Adepta Sororitas.

**Alternate Rank:** 5 or higher (3,000 xp).

#### **Duty Unto Death (Talent)**

**Requirement:** WP 45, Pure Faith

Such is the power of your faith that it can sustain you where mere flesh would fail. You may spend a Fate Point to ignore the effects of injury (including critical hits that do not kill outright), Fatigue and Stunning during an encounter. This Talent does not stop you being injured, and you may still be killed normally. It just allows you to temporarily ignore the effects of your injuries while a particular combat lasts.

#### <span id="page-80-0"></span>**Templar Calix of the Scholastia Psykana** Scholastia Psy kana

*"Will and blade, life and death, cause and consequence, mind and matter, soul's truth and warp's lie: all things indivisible and one."*

— Temple Calix Training Mantra.

Operating within the ranks of Imperial Sanctioned Psykers, the Psykana Temple Calix is an order of elite militant psyker-warriors, battle mystics devoted to personal skill at arms and the focusing of their psychic might and abilities to augment their power in close combat.

The Scholastia Psykana is made up clusters of sanctioned schools, methods and traditions that focus on the use of psychic power, which, although overseen and regulated by the authorities on Holy Terra, can vary greatly from sector to sector, both in their methods and in their philosophy. Within the Calixis Sector, there are many such branches of the Scholastia, one of the smallest and most reclusive of are the Templars Calix, whose isolated temple-monastery is based in the polar wastelands of Scintilla. While several branches of the Scholastia focus on preparing sanctioned battlefield psykers for use alongside the armies of the Imperium in the battlefield, or their function as specialist advisors to military commanders, the Psykana Temple Calix focuses instead on martial skill, honing the mind and body together to create deadly superhuman warriors who can vanquish their foes in a blaze of power and with the screaming edge of a force blade.

Some say the traditions of the Templars Calix came from one of Angevin's closest advisors who was a scion of a militant branch of the Scholastia originating in a distant part of the Segmentum Solar. Others claim it was Drusus who founded the temple to provide him with specialist bodyguards after his near death on Maccabeus Quintus. No matter what their origin, the mystic training of the Templars Calix today focus on the use of their member's psychic ability in conjunction with deadly methods of close-quarter fighting. Personal loyalty to the Golden Throne, psyker-mysticism, self-discipline and the fighting arts, both armed and unarmed, are drilled into the Psykana Templars. Their skills encompass brutally simple methods of killing an opponent and more elaborate manoeuvres commonly attributed only to assassins, as well as defensive techniques and practiced agility. The use of all manner of exotic weapons is also taught but the central focus of a Templar's training is the use of force weaponry, the psychoactive properties of which make these weapons extensions of the wielder's own power. In the hands of a Templar Calix, such a weapon becomes a channel for the destructive forces both of this world and beyond. Usually clothed in plain midnight-blue robes or the dark storm coats of the Adeptus Terra, when overt in displaying who and what they are, the Psykana Templars Calix wear close fitting cowled mantles of black samite and cover their visages with masks of tarnished silver to show blank and emotionless faces to the world.

The Psykana Templars Calix are few, even in comparison to other Orders of Sanctioned Psykers, and are in constant demand throughout the sector and beyond. Military commanders and high ranking adepts prize the presence of a Psykana Templar as a bodyguard above nearly all others. On rare occasions small units of Templars have been deployed as part of a full scale conflict, but such actions have not been seen for centuries. Of course, the psychic and martial skills of a Psykana Templar are of great use to the Inquisition, both as Acolyte agents and as highly effective executioners. No less than Lord Inquisitor Caidin himself, the Grand Master of the Ordos Calixis, is guarded and aided by a Psykana Templar Calix, known simply as Shade, a powerful telekine and swordsman of unearthly skill who is one of his most trusted servants.

#### **Becoming a Templar Calix of the Scholastia Psykana**

To become a Templar Calix you must achieve acceptance by the masters of the Psykana Temple Calix. These masters look primarily for a controlled and stable personality and psychic potential rather than martial skill (which they are supremely confident their training can impart). Joining the temple and going through training should occasion a period of several months "downtime" for the character between adventures. During this time they must help construct or obtain a force weapon of their own (see [page 187](#page-187-0) [and 245\), w](#page-245-0)hich may result in a small scenario for the Player Character at the GMs discretion.

It is likely that, as you spend experience on this Alternative Career, your character will advance several Ranks in the Savant Militant path. You can use the following titles for your Templar Calix character within the Order at those Ranks, instead of the standard ones listed for the Psyker Career.

| Rank | Name                 | XP            |
|------|----------------------|---------------|
| 4    | Templar Tertius      | 2,000–2,999   |
| 5    | Templar Secundus     | 3,000–5,999   |
| 6    | Templar Primus       | 6,000–7,999   |
| 7    | Templar Ordinator    | 8,000–9,999   |
| 8    | Master Templar Calix | 10,000–14,999 |

**Required Career:** Imperial Psyker.

**Alternate Rank:** 4: Savant Militant or higher (2,000 xp). **Other Requirements:** You must have no more than 10 Insanity Points and 10 Corruption Points.

#### **Martial Prowess**

Owing to the Temple's focus on martial skill above intellectualism, at the point of becoming a Templar Calix, the psyker changes their characteristic advance scheme as follows:

| Characteristic Simple Intermediate |     |     | Trained | Expert |
|------------------------------------|-----|-----|---------|--------|
| Weapon Skill                       | 100 | 250 | 500     | 750    |
| Intelligence                       | 500 | 750 | 1000    | 2500   |

Any Advances purchased for these Characteristics prior to taking the Alternative Career still count towards the Characteristic's development. For example, a psyker who has already bought a Simple Weapon Skill Advance has only three further Advances possible for this Characteristic.

| Advance                          | Cost | Type | Prerequisites                      |

# II: Calixian Careers

#### <span id="page-82-0"></span>**Tyrantine Shadow Agent** Tyrantine Shadow Agent

*"Lest the truth devour all."* 

— Memento Mori on the Tomb of Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos.

The Inquisition, some say, is an empire of secrets. To outsiders, this is certainly the case, for in stern judgement and shrouded in mystery the Holy Ordos sit above them like wrathful gods, little understood and rightly feared. But what is not so widely known by outsiders is that there are many secrets the Inquisition keeps from its own, either because it is expedient to do so, or because they are simply too dangerous even for some members of the Ordos to know. These secrets are often held through invisible webs of patronage, fealty and alliance, but sometimes manifest themselves though shadow empires: whole organisations hidden under the wider umbrella of the Holy Ordos whose nature and concerns remain mysterious even to other Inquisitors and Acolytes. Within the Calixis Sector one such group is the Tyrantine Cabal.

Inside the Calixian Conclave, there is no greater divider than the Hereticus Tenebrae, the Tyrant Star. The supreme danger of the Star is not known to all even within the Inquisition's own ranks. Within the Calixian conclave, even those who do know something rarely have anything but a piece of the puzzle. In no small part, the Tyrantine Cabal is responsible for maintaining this ignorance, just as much as it is investigating what the Hereticus Tenebrae represents and how to combat it.

As the years have progressed, this web of secrecy and control has taken on a life almost of its own, and methods and agencies have sprung up to support it and its master's goals. One such powerful agency is the Tenebrae Collegium—a shadow empire all of its own founded by the genius of the renowned Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. The Collegium takes the most promising and suitable of Acolytes and transforms them into subtle and lethal instruments of deception, whose true allegiances can remain secret even from the Inquisitors they serve. These Acolytes are perfectly suited to keeping the Tyrantine Cabals purposes hidden and enacting its will without remorse or apprehension. The existence of the Collegium and its so-called "shadow agents" is a matter officially denied by the Cabal and the source of much secret debate and suspicion within the Conclave Calixis as a whole. How far does its reach stretch? How many agents does it have? And what darkness might go undiscovered lurking at the heart of such a strange and hidden power? Few know, but many outside the Cabal have grave misgivings, and some even have fashioned secret networks of their own in response.

#### **The Shadow Agents**

It is said Cassilda Cognos once quipped in a rare moment of levity that the Collegium "took outstanding dissemblers and accomplished liars and then began their work". Certainly, the results of the Collegium's conditioning do produce agents more than capable of moving through the Imperium in a carefully woven fog of falsity and misdirection. Using tiny gestures, key words and cadences, two agents can communicate vital information in the presence of others who remain none the wiser. Furthermore, using psychic and mental conditioning, a graduate of the Collegium can close his mind to all but the most destructive psychic probing, concealing his deepest secrets around a labyrinth of half truths and falsity to confuse, making them not only extraordinarily proficient spies and agents, but near-impregnable living vaults for the secrets of the Cabal.

The ultimate purpose of these Tyrantine agents is to firstly hold the Cabal above all other masters, to pursue knowledge of the Tyrant Star and to keep that knowledge safe from all outside the Cabal's jealous circle. In most cases, these goals coincide with the agent's duties as Acolytes of the Ordos Calixis. However, where their true loyalties have come into conflict with the Adepta or even immediate superiors outside of the Cabal, this has led to cold and brutal conflict with those the agent would ordinarily call their lords, comrades, or even friends. So far, the Cabal has managed to keep all such "difficulties" from wider knowledge. The time may come, though, when the fate of all is at stake and they will have to act no matter what the cost. Perhaps a civil war will erupt within the Ordos Calixis as a result. This is a nightmare, however, that this secret empire, this order within an order, must bear, for their own fearful secrets are as nothing to the dangers of the Hereticus Tenebrae, and some must be sacrificed lest its truth devour us all.

Born of Prophecy and Shadow: The Tenebrae Collegium

The birth of this shadowy brotherhood is rumoured to have occurred several decades ago when Lord Inquisitor Caidin granted leave to (the then) Inquisitor Zerbe to form a special conclave within the Calixian Conclave following new understandings of the revelations of the Propheticum Hereticus Tenebrae. The formation of such an organisation was deeply unpopular amongst many in the broader Calixian Conclave who saw Zerbe raising his own base of power in the Bastion Serpentis, and feared that the inner circle of the Cabal might begin to subvert the Ordos Calixis to one man's blind obsession. Zerbe, however, had trusted the full import of the prophecy to only his closest and most trusted peers, among them the ferociously intelligent and well-respected Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. It was her voice that swayed Lord Inquisitor Caidin to their cause. It was also she who conceived the plan to form the Tenebrae Collegium, reasoning that while the effort of all the Ordos was needed to unravel the Tyrant Star's mystery, the Cabal's inner circle would need to find their own core of allies and servants—even amongst the vassals of their obstinate comrades if needs be—to carry out their work and ward off utter disaster. So was born the Tenebrae Collegium, a brotherhood of higher purpose, and into it Cognos poured all her skill and brilliance, although she was herself only to survive just long enough to see the first wave of agents "graduate". The Tenebrae Collegium endures as memorial both lasting and terrible to her vision.

*"Sleep well tonight. Dream the sweetest of dreams and remember their careless touch. For it will be the last peaceful sleep you will ever have."*

> — Address to newly inducted Wardens by Senior Arbiter Kae Drusil.

Something festers in the fabric of the Calixis Sector, something that eats away at is foundations, deceives its people and gnaws at its sanctity. While some in high authority scorn such melodramatic conclusions, there are others who have the foresight and the will to confront this parasite of heresy and rip it out of the body of the population. This is a disease of deviant faith, a worship of false gods, corrupt ideologies and moral bankruptcy. It is spawning an epidemic of deluded citizens in its wake. It is these citizens who are the malignant flesh of this disease and it is this flesh that must be cut out. Such is the thesis of Senior Arbiter Kae Drusil. It was to combat this groundswell of recidivists, cultists and degenerates that under the authority of the Lord Sector himself, the Divisio Immoralis was founded. To some, Drusil's force is just another brutal tool of oppression built to placate the paranoia of Governor Hax and his inner circle, but to Drusil and those who follow her, they see themselves as nothing less than guardians of civilisation and order in the sector—although in practical terms the force is limited largely to Hive Sibellus itself.

#### **The Work of Diviso Immorialis**

With authorisation to pursue their investigations throughout the sector, the wardens operate alone or in pairs beyond Hive Sibellus, and pursue their own leads, sifted data and lines of enquiry. Such autonomy is the cause for some contention within the Adeptus Arbites, but it is not due to laxness on Drusil's part—as she has explained repeatedly and at length to her contemporaries—but because with so few wardens and a sector to guard, she cannot be everywhere and sign every carta personally. Likewise, their roving and ill-defined remit and poor reputation is the cause of a frequent lack of cooperation by local enforcers and even other members of the Adeptus Arbites. They are often made painfully aware of the limits of their authority. This friction can manifest in ways ranging from a simple denial of resources or by hamstringing the wardens with red tape, to the unfortunate disappearance of several wardens looking into the affairs of the Sollex Tech sect. Though they may not be well-respected, they have been proved right on several occasions; certainly their presence has prevented several atrocities and revolts from occurring in the past.

The Diviso is the child of Drusil's vision and obsession, and the task force of Adeptus Arbites all look to the greyhaired veteran as their mentor and leader. Drusil believes with total conviction that the rise in cult activity and the numbers of those turning against the Creed and law in recent years is no accident; somewhere behind the scenes a dread purpose pulls the strings to propel the sector towards some terrible dark future. Authorised and smiled on by the Lord Marshal it might be, but the Divisio has its opponents, and they are powerful.

Some Arbites within the sector see it as a needless eccentricity at best and a product of the burnt out veteran's paranoia at worst. A few see it as a deliberate overstepping of concerns that rightfully are the sole province of Ordo Hereticus and the Ministorum—just one more avenue by which Hax hopes to consolidate his power. As a result, many shield their most capable and talented officers from transfer to the task force and Drusil must make do with what she can get: eccentrics, burn-outs and the occasional promising novice. The Inquisition for their part have indulged the Diviso's existence at least for now.

That the Divisio Immoralis is comparably small and its senior is held in barely veiled contempt by the Adeptus Arbites across the sector does not detract from their remit or their fierce dedication to their appointed task. In the absence of the best-trained staff, Drusil has selected those who share her obsession. Though they may not be the toughest or most promising arbitrators, most of her "wardens" fully believe in their commander and are incredibly dedicated to the task that has fallen to them. Many have also come to believe some great and overarching moral threat seeks to

envelop the sector, and they have dedicated their efforts to combating the rot they see festering at the heart of Hive Sibellus in particular. They are undoubtedly dedicated, but few are prepared for the things they must encounter, lacking the esoteric learning or defences the Inquisition enjoys.

In an echo of their mistress, many wardens are strained and brittle men and women. Hard-drinking is a common, if hidden, vice in the Divisio. Trauma-fatigue and psychological burn-outs are not uncommon in those called to serve in this specialised taskforce.

#### **Becoming a Warden of the Divisio Immoralis**

Deciding to become a Warden of the Divisio at character creation may form an excellent explanation for your induction into the Inquisition. Somewhat equipped with specialised knowledge and a concern with subtle and subversive activity, wardens make excellent Acolytes for Inquisitors of all stripes, even if they have to be "disabused" of a few of the fallacies the Divisio believes true first. If you opt to join the Divisio later in your Career, it is undoubtedly with the consent of your Inquisitor who values having a servant embedded in the Divisio to see all that passes through the taskforce's cramped offices on Scintilla.

Upon becoming a Warden of the Divisio Immoralis, you gain 1d5 Insanity points.

#### **Required Career:** Arbitrator.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (o xp).

You may take this Alternate Rank during character creation. This does not affect your starting Skills and Talents. It only changes where you can invest your starting xp.

### <span id="page-86-0"></span>ELITE ADVANCE PACKAGES Elite Advan ce Packag es

*"As the ancients did, I find travel narrows the mind wonderfully."*

— Lord Sector Marius Hax.

While Alternate Careers represent a fundamental shift in your direction by way of your training, goals or role, there are things that can profoundly effect the way you behave or even the fundamentals of who you are that have little or nothing to do with Career choice. It may be some conviction of belief, some strange event, or even something that has been deliberately inflicted on you. One very good way of reflecting these life-changing occurrences is by the use of Elite Advance packages. These build on the rules for Elite Advances (see sidebar for a summary of these) to allow your character to spend their xp outside their usual development found in their Career Path to gain an unusual Skill or Talent, or, in this case, a package of changes (for both good and ill). In some cases where the effects might be largely detrimental, the cost might be very low. W

Regardless of how your xp are spent, you advance through the Ranks of your Career Path normally.

There is an endless variety of Elite Advance Packages, just as there are a limitless number of potential life altering events, and indeed Elite Packages are intended for use by GMs to be something of a campaign toolbox; providing them a framework through which they can express their own creativity (fiendish or otherwise) and customise the development of their campaign and Player Characters.

There are also no hard and fast rules for creating them. It's up to the GMs own judgement as to what they should cost relative to the abilities or potential advances they grant, but bear in mind firstly that this is the 41st Millennium, a hard, harsh and dark future where nothing should be without its price. This doesn't just mean xp, but also in more direct costs to the character in terms which can be either explicit— Insanity Points, Characteristic loss or Corruption Points or more ephemeral (but no less challenging) costs such as restrictions on behaviour, in-game enemies or secret masters to whom they are beholden.

If you'd rather develop your own ideas, look to the background options shown in Chapter I and the examples that follow for ideas. Astute readers may already have noticed that the rules for Dark Pacts found in Dark Heresy offer a very similar and parallel system for accounting for unusual abilities. Elite Advance Packages should always be narrative led, this is to say they should reflect an in-game occurrence or some force, ideology, faction or event within the *Warhammer 40,000* universe of your games, not just an excuse to string together abilities a player wants that they can't normally have.

The example packages shown here represent ways of adding a new element into a Career, such as the emergence of Psychic Powers of the Nascent Psyker package, or show the aftermath of a terrible event that has befallen a character, such as the restoration of a Critically Wounded PC to life with the Cybernetic Resurrection package. The Cult of the Red Redemption package shows the potential benefits and drawbacks of belonging to the inner circle of a secret cult or society.

The use of Elite Advance Packages is of course an optional rule—as they modify and can potentially upset the balance of the character progression system, they are recommended for experienced groups.

#### **Elite Advances Rules Summary**

Your character's nature and development is broadly defined by their Career Path. However, the Advancements listed are not the sum total of all that your character could learn. Sometimes your character will be exposed to certain Skills or Talents during play or, as a result of their experience, they deliberately seek out new abilities to combat or exploit the things they encounter.

Sometimes your GM will offer you an opportunity to take an Elite Advance as a consequence of your character's actions, or developing events in-game. Sometimes these Elite Advances come with additional side effects, such as Corruption or Insanity Points, or your character becoming indebted to an NPC or part of a conspiracy.

You can also request an Elite Advance for a Skill or Talent not listed on your Advancement Scheme, but this must be reasonable and appropriate for your character and the situation they are in. To make a request you will need the following:

- Logical justification for your character to have the Elite Advance.
- An explanation for how you gained the Advance, how you got it, time taken, resources expended, etc.
- An offer of how many Experience Points or other cost you are willing to pay to gain the Advance. The further a Skill or Talent lies outside your character's normal area of expertise, the more it should cost; likewise for particularly rare or unusual knowledge.

Your GM may decide not to grant you the Elite Advance, or request a higher xp cost than that you have suggested; or impose some other counterbalancing penalty. Your GM may also rule that you need to pass a series of Tests in order to successfully learn the requested Skill or Talent. This usually ties into your explanation for how you gained the Advance.

All of the following Elite Advance Packages include key information about the effects of the Advance, restrictions on who can take them, costs and any relevant effects.

#### **CyberneticResurrection** Cy bernetic Resurrection

*"He has been born again in the purity of metal and the sweet embrace of the Omnissiah's lightning. The flesh that so recently failed him is but a fleeting memory. Glory is his now, shriven of his weakness and his pain, his is the strength of unyielding iron."* — Magos Volkite Fell, speaking of the reconstructed Inquisitor Herrod.

The Magos of the Adeptus Mechanicus harbour a great many secrets and ancient and terrible arts. If their price is met, they can salvage the most ravaged body so long as the central nervous system is largely intact and the brain is serviceable. Taking a mangled, burned, but still alive carcass or even the merest threads of flesh and bio-matter, they can construct new body from the remains of the old, or even refit a servitor chassis to house the brain if needed. Less heavily damaged bodies are easier to repair, though the results are far from elegant or guaranteed.

#### **Restrictions:** None.

**Advance Cost:** 200 or 500 xp.

You must first have suffered Critical Wounds sufficient to incapacitate you permanently or have death averted through burning Fate Points. The Cult Mechanicus may also charge a price of their own, which is likely to be very high.

#### **Effects**

The effects of this Advance come in two forms dependant on the state of the body to be remade:

Cyber-Rebuild: You are repaired with sufficient replacement limbs, organs and the like to see you achieve functionality once more. The replacement parts are of Common quality unless circumstances dictate otherwise. If you are a techpriest, any previous implants are fully restored. However, the experience of the cyber-rebuild scars you deeply, imposing 1d10 Insanity Points and permanently reducing your Fellowship Characteristic by 1d10.

Full Resurrection: Of all the wonders capable by the machine-smiths, only a few Magos have the skill to perform the feat of full resurrection, and fewer still have the inclination to do it, especially at the behest of others. Assuming that such an individual can be located and their price—far beyond mere money—be met, you are reconstructed with an artificial body, organs harvested from servitor stock or vat-grown synthetics, a process that can have terrible repercussions for the mind. Survivors of this procedure are rarely stable, their personalities and motivations a mere shadow of their former selves. Upon gaining a full resurrection, apply the follow changes:

• Erase your current Strength, Toughness and Agility Characteristics and replace them with 30+2d10 for Strength, 30+2d10 for Toughness and 15+2d10 for

Agility. Any previous Advances to these Characteristics are lost. Also, you may not improve these Characteristics without the assistance of a skilled Magos.

- Permanently reduce your Fate Points by 1.
- Halve your Fellowship Characteristic.
- Any Talents you have whose prerequisites you no longer meet are lost.
- Gain 10+1d10 Insanity Points and apply any lasting effects immediately.
- Gain the following Talents: Autosanguine, Prosanguine, Chem Geld, Disturbing Voice, Resistance (Cold), Resistance (Fear) and Resistance (Toxins).
- You gain an in-built rebreather.
- You gain 2 points of Armour to all Locations.
- You may no longer be healed through the use of the Medicae skill.
- You may no longer swim.
- The GM may allow further implant systems. Also, the Magos may do more than augment you; they may tamper with your mind and memories, resulting in all sorts of unexpected and unfortunate side effects.
- Finally, while you retain your approximate size and shape, you are clearly inhuman even at a glance. This may result in a variety of complications as determined by the GM.

See **Chapter V: Forge Worlds** for more information on implants and other devices of the Cult Mechanicus.

#### <span id="page-88-0"></span>**The Cult of the Red Redemption** The Cult of the Red Redemption

*"There is only one true path and that is the path of fire and pain."*

— Inquisitor Goldo, Monodomination: The Right of Man to Rule the Galaxy.

The Imperium is swollen with corruption and it must be cleansed by fire and by the weapons of the pure. Only then will it be made into a realm of piety and purity, or so at least the Cult of the Emperor's Red Redemption believes. An extreme militant cult of the Imperial Creed, they believe the only way to achieve redemption for themselves, and ultimately mankind, is to cleanse it of sinfulness. This cleansing is best achieved by fire, which leaves no trace of corruption, and by the death of the corrupt so their taint cannot spread. The Redemption justifies their purpose with a simple belief that the God-Emperor of Mankind is manifest proof of mankind's holy destiny to rule the stars. The sinfulness that is all around keeps mankind from fulfilling its density. So it is the duty of the faithful to remove the sin that holds back mankind, to remove the chains of impurity.

Crucially, the Redemption believes that three sins encompass and surpass all others. These are the sins of abomination, witchery and heresy. Abomination is sin and corruption made manifest by the distortion and corruption of the flesh into unnatural forms, generally referred to as mutation. Witchery is the ability to use unnatural powers. Heresy is refusing the truth of the Redemption or working against its holy purpose.

#### **The Calixian Redemption**

The Redemption came to Calixis long ago from far away in the Segmentum Solar, blown like seeds in the minds of pilgrims, soldiers and priests. It found fertile ground in the slums of the Scintillan underhives and took root. The extremes of the Redemption have always found toleration in certain sections of the Ecclesiarchy and it is this toleration of intolerance that allowed the Redemption to spread, as it normally does to the depths of hives, ship bilges and factory sumps where mankind toils in ignorance. From this willing base, it spread to find adherents in the middle ranks of society: the hab workers, the scribes and tithe counters who note the tides of dissolution that wash around them and feel nothing but hate. It has even penetrated the Adeptus Terra itself, where Administratum prefects tuck their unworn red robes beneath their beds and arbitrators go to sleep reciting the Ludmillan Dictates. Behind it all, many believe there are a few senior pontiffs of the Ecclesiarchy, men and women who know that the Ministorum needs to be as strong in arms as it is in faith.

Within the Holy Ordos, there are very few who directly cleave to the Redemption's creed but there are many who sympathise, even to applaud the sect's aims and methods. In particular, those of Monodominant belief are likely to see the Redemption as little more than a crude extension of their own philosophy. It is mainly these Inquisitors who employ members of the Redemption as Acolytes, trusting to their righteous hatred to guide their Acolytes' actions. Some even use the Redemption as a recruiting tool, taking those who have already realised the rewards of tolerance are treachery and betrayal.

**Restrictions:** Psykers and Tech-Priests or members of any other sect, secret guild or conspiracy (such as the Moritat, the Collegium Tenebrae, etc.) are barred from this Elite Advance Package.

#### **Advance Cost:** 150 xp.

**Effect:** You gain the Flagellant and Frenzy talents, and the Secret Tongue (the Redemption) skill. You also gain the True Believer trait. Additionally, from this point on, you can spend xp on the cult based Advances shown in the table on [page 88.](#page-88-0)

#### **True Believer (Trait)**

As a true believer, you must cleave to the Ludmillan Dictates (see sidebar). Violating these dictates or acting against their teachings (even if under direct order or pain of death) causes you profound discomfort and mental stress. In such instances, you must succeed on a Willpower Test. If you fail, roll on the Shock Table in Dark Heresy (see page 233). The GM sets the Difficulty based on the severity of the breach of faith.

#### **Nascent Psyker** Nascent Psy ker

*"We are your future both bright and dark."* — The Heretic Thaylon Sol, Rogue Psyker.

A nascent psyker is a person who gives birth to a talent they never knew they had: the power to bend the warp to their will and with it, forge changes in the physical world. Such a metamorphosis is brutal and dangerous, and not only for the psyker. Untempered by training or experience, the undiluted power manifested by a nascent psyker can eclipse anything they may later wield. Slaved not to conscious will but to the capricious fears and desires of the subconscious, the nacent's power is the raw power of a new born child given the keys

to godhood.

No matter what their age or position, the Imperium hunts constantly and remorselessly for nascent psykers. This is not only because the survival of the Emperor Himself depends on the sacrifice of psykers, but also because a nascent psyker is a threat of terrifying potential. Daemons and warp predators are drawn to the flailing soul-light of a nascent psyker like carrion to a fresh carcass. To such creatures, the untrained, frightened and barely in control power of a nascent psyker makes them a delightfully helpless prey whom they may toy with or consume with equal ease. Though such possibilities are a reason for the Imperium's constant vigilance for emerging psykers, it is not the only reason: the emergent powers of a nascent psyker are cause enough.

#### **Metamorphosis**

While many psykers' powers emerge during adolescence, this is not so for all. Some are born with their powers, while others can live half their lives of more before the potential within them manifests. In many cases, extreme mental or physical trauma or exposure to the power of the warp can force latent potential to the fore in people who never dreamt that they possessed any psychic ability. From the Guardsman who rends apart an enemy tank with his terror even as he cowers alone thinking his death certain, to the aged savant who wishes he never had read the small hide-bound volume, there are many ways for a hidden power to work its way into being.

To see a nascent psyker's power unbound is to see the potential of man as a god, a god of terror and pain. In many cases, the power wielded at such moments is beyond that of a trained and sanctioned psyker and often beyond reckoning. The records of the Witch Hunters detail many instances which serve to caution any who underestimate the danger posed by a nascent psyker: storms of psychic energy kilometres across, psychic shock waves strong enough to shatter plasteel and towering infernos of power are but a few of the details recorded by servants of Ordo Hereticus.

#### The Ludmillan Dictates

Archdeacon Ludmilla is the self-styled leader of the Redemption in the Calixis Sector, who has crushed those who oppose her with ruthless efficiency. To cement her spiritual rulership, Ludmilla released a number of dictates to which all those true and pure should adhere to:

- • Red is the colour of Redemption; it is the colour of fire and blood.
- • Do not consume narcotics, alcohol or other substances that give pleasure. They are sin given substance.•
- Do not suffer the witch to live; cast them to the fire.•

•

- Do not suffer the mutant to live; rend their flesh apart. •
- Do not suffer the heretic for they have heard the Emperor's truth and have heeded it not. Force them to penance and then to death • Should the Emperor . 's service require you to appear as others, do so. The mask and red robes of Redemption must be donned when the time comes to set the sinner to their fate.
- When you take up the weapons of the Emperor, do not show your face. You are the Emperor's tool and not on your own business • Pain is a gift: mortification is a duty that should be performed daily . .

#### **Dealing with Nascent Psykers as <sup>a</sup> GM**

Revealing a nascent psyker among a group of Player Characters is as exciting as it is challenging, but it is never something that the GM should spring on an unsuspecting player; since upon acquiring this Elite Advance Package is effectively a "death sentence" for the character. Instead, wait for a player to approach you about their interest in turning their character into a wellspring of potential. If you are amenable to the idea, let them, but wait for the proper time for when the powers reveal themselves. They don't just appear when a player spends the xp; they appear when there is a sufficient trigger (see following).

Once the powers have been revealed, whether or not the other PCs are aware of the fundamental change in their comrade or not, it's up to the player with this Elite Advance Package to stay alive. Keeping these powers secret from other Acolytes (a typical tactic for those in the 41st Millennium) is extremely difficult and almost always discovered and, when they are, they face death or sentencing to one of the mysterious Black Ships to find who knows what fate. Let the events unfold naturally in the game and don't use a heavy hand, either to help the psyker or to hinder. If the Acolyte shows off his powers foolishly, then bring down the hammer, but if the player takes precautions to hide this weird development, don't sabotage his efforts until he makes the fatal mistake that inevitably leads to his doom.

#### **The Effects of Extreme Stress**

Once the player opts to acquire this Elite Advance Package, he just has to wait for the proper moment. Nascent psykers have no control over when their powers first manifest and must rely on stressful experience to unleash their newfound might. Such moments might be when the character takes a large amount of Damage or endures unspeakable torture at the hands of some heretic or warp entity, but never at the player's decision.

When you deem the moment is right, go for it. It's up to you to describe the exact effects of the reveal, whether it's bleeding walls, arcs of lightning bursting from the Acolyte, or a vicious eldritch storm exploding overhead. Feel free to roll or select a Psychic Phenomena from Table 6–2 (see page 162) in Dark Heresy, or just make something up. Allow the Player Character to Test Willpower to regain some control, with a Difficulty determined by the intensity of the event, with degrees of success or failure raising or diminishing the effects as you decide.

#### **The Problem of Sanctioning**

Once it is known that a character is a nascent psyker, they must either become a rogue, dodging capture, or be sanctioned. A character's fellow Acolytes, or even their Inquisitor master, if they are Radically inclined, may help to conceal the character's emerging abilities. This may work for a time, but eventually a nascent psyker has to face being revealed. At this point, the character's only hopes of survival are to flee or to be taken by the Black Ships. In most cases, either of these choices puts the character beyond playability in Dark Heresy. It is possible that if found strong enough, and if they survive their training, the character could return as a sanctioned Imperial psyker.

#### **Becoming a Nascent Psyker**

Almost any character may become a nascent psyker at any time. It costs nothing to do so and only requires the complete consent of your GM. Taking this Career is a not only a character changing decision, it also has a profound impact on the other players and any campaign your GM is running. Taking this Career Path most likely result in the death, possession or loss of your character to the Black Ships. However, the road to these outcomes can be a deeply enjoyable roleplaying experience, but be aware that ultimately, you doom your character.

**Restrictions:** Imperial Psykers and Tech-Priests may not select this Elite Advance Package.

**Advance Cost:** None (available at the GMs discretion), **Effect:** You gain the Nascent Power trait and you can now purchases Advances from the list below in addition to those on your Career Path.

| Advance      | Cost | Type | Prerequisites |
|--------------|------|------|---------------|
| Deceit       | 100  | S    | —             |
| Psyniscience | 100  | S    | —             |

#### **Nascent Power (Trait)**

**Restriction:** Characters with Psy Ratings can never have this Trait.

You harbour incredible and uncontrollable psychic power. At times, the power within you is so great it threatens to break reality around you. At other times, it submits to your will with ease. You gain a single random Minor Psychic Power (see Minor Powers in Chapter VI: Psychic Powers in Dark Heresy). This power never changes and you can use it automatically without making a Power Roll and without generating Psychic Phenomena. At the start of every gaming session you gain a number of Psychic Powers equal to 1d10 – your Willpower Bonus. If this results in 0 or less, you gain no powers that session. These powers are randomly chosen and can be from several Disciplines. You may use these powers automatically without making a Power Roll, but each use generates Psychic Phenomena.

# Chapter III: Feral & Feudal Worlds Chapter III:Feral & Feudal Worlds

*"Don't matter if it's stone or synth-steel, a knife in the guts hurts all the same."*

— Scivener Myras Dance.

The Calixis Sector is no different from the many other sectors making up the Imperium in that the planets man has claimed are unimaginably diverse. As well as its hive, agri and shrine worlds, Calixis has its fair share of primitive worlds. In fact, Iocanthos, home of the Ghostfire pollen harvests, is tithed as an agri-world, but its tribal culture and barbaric people mean it would have been graded as an insignificant feral world were it not for the Imperium's need for this rare commodity. T

The primitive worlds throughout the Calixis Sector, and the Imperium as a whole for that matter, fall in one of two broad categories. The first are the feral worlds, those planets whose societies are formed by indigenous tribes or nomads. Technology on these backwater worlds is pre black powder and in some regressed cases, pre ferrous or lithic. The peoples tend to be tough, hardy and durable, and those few who make it off their home world and survive the horrors of a far wider universe are thought to be good stock, be it for the Imperial Guard or even as a Space Marine should they be so blessed.

The second group includes the feudal worlds, also sometimes known as medieval worlds. These worlds are usually on the cusp of discovering black powder or are grappling with the mess this technological leap often creates. In many cases, societies are not much more advanced than those on feral worlds, having emerged from primitive tribal structures to become region-based kingdoms. The movement of people into ever-increasing settlements, villages and towns causes society to become stratified into noble classes and peasant classes, with the difference between the two sharply distinct. Some medieval worlds form specific warrior orders and religious sects.

Naturally the feral world/feudal world distinction is one of simplicity. There are a great many worlds that fall somewhere between the two, some having attained black powder but still trapped in primitive extended family units, or others possessing advanced societal structures without the benefit of technological developments. As well, there are also numerous feudal worlds that have continued to develop since first being catalogued and now have access to technologies of which the citizens of hive cities would be envious.

Weapons and equipment originating from these worlds are primitive and considered obsolete by the more worldly inhabitants of the Imperium, since even a las weapon on its lowest setting packs more punch than a bow. However, in the hands of an expert, such weaponry can prove just as deadly. Any hive scum can wield a laspistol inaccurately, but a practised marksman could shoot an arrow through the eye of his mark without even triggering an energy resistant refractor field. Technology in the 41st Millennium is notoriously unreliable and can let you down at the most inopportune time. More basic and primitive equipment may not have all the gadgets, but in the right hands, it may prove to be the thing that keeps you fighting—and keeps you alive.

### <span id="page-93-0"></span>Ranged Weapons Rang ed Weapons

*"Reload and fire when I say! They may have glowing armour, lads, but we have our muskets and our powder—they don't stand a chance."*

— Chief Marksman Naid Forder.

Ranged weapons used on feral and feudal worlds are handcrafted items, assembled by talented bowyers or gunsmiths who learn their trade through apprenticeship to another master. Where black powder weapons are present, many are artfully constructed, incorporating animal motifs into their design or inscribed with prayers to the God-Emperor. These items are also always fashioned from materials found on these worlds, substituting unusual substances where wood and iron are scarce. R

#### **Iocanthos Blunderbuss**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

A common primitive form of the black powder weapon is the blunderbuss. Essentially a large metal tube equipped with a primitive firing mechanism, these weapons are favoured for their ease of use and the havoc that they cause more than the damage they deal. Blunderbusses are also worthy of note for their seemingly indestructible ability to fire anything placed into the barrel, and it is unsurprising to know that they are also called "scrappers" or "pelters" on some worlds, referring largely to their foraged ammunition.

A particular example, the Iocanthos blunderbuss has a notoriously short range but a very wide spray from its conelike bore. Anything unlucky enough to be standing in front of one when its fired is likely to badly lacerated with metal scrap, lead shot and burning embers.

#### **Composite Bow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

Composite bows are constructed from a variety of materials such as wood, sinew and horn fused together under pressure to give the bow a compact design without sacrificing power. Accurate and quick to use, composite bows require substantial craftsmanship to make and care to look after, but offer notable advantages over most primitive black powder weapons. Composite bows created on advanced worlds use the same principal as their forbears but are crafted from superior materials, enabling them to shoot custom arrows that would not necessarily fly from a bow of classical design.

#### **Deuce Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Primitive)

This twin-barrelled flintlock pistol is popular on many worlds where duelling is common, and it also serves as a useful hunting sidearm. Most models of the deuce pistol feature separate triggers, one for each barrel, thus allowing the wielder to fire twice before having to reload. Typically, they can both be pulled at once—whether the powder takes or not is another matter.

#### **Fedrid Razor Disk**

**Class:** Exotic (Fedrid Razor Disk)

The hunters of Fedrid employ an unusual thrown weapon on their expeditions, the razor disk. About the side of a standard dinner plate, the weapon features a sharpened edge all around its outer surface. Numerous holes, made at 45 degree angles, pierce the disk's surface so that when thrown the air passing through creates a low humming sound, allowing the hunter to follow the disc by sound as it disappears into the dense Fedrid undergrowth.

#### **Flick Bow**

**Class:** Pistol (Primitive)

A flick bow is a compact version of the hand bow and is a popular sidearm for coachmen, ladies of negotiable affection and criminal gangs on many medieval worlds, although the finest crafted examples are made by the artisans of Balecaster. Constructed so that its span folds inwards for easy concealment, a flick bow can be hidden in a boot, muffler or sleeve for use in unexpected and unpleasant situations.

Before firing this weapon, you must spend a Half Action to "lock" the bow.

#### **Heavy Crossbow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

The heavy crossbow or arbalest is a ranged weapon of considerable size and is capable of delivering bolts with astonishing force, easily able to punch through primitive armour. Heavy crossbows find use in the endless wars of feudal kings, whilst others are gaudy, hunting toys of the nobility. In either case, the hefty damage that these weapons inflict is not to be ignored.

#### **Javelin**

#### **Class:** Thrown (Primitive)

A form of light spear intended for throwing, used both for hunting and fighting. The javelin is a common sight on very primitive worlds that have devolved into savagery, such as Faldon Kise, and carried in clusters by the chariot-mounted warriors of Monrass.

#### **Longbow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

A longbow is a larger variant of the more traditional bow, designed to send projectiles through dense steel plates and against much more distant targets. A longbow is typically crafted from the heartwood of a tree and most measure two metres or more in length. The quality of the weapon is wholly dependant on where it originates. Even on more advanced worlds, longbows see use, although this may be more for sport and hunting than for actual combat. Bows manufactured on these worlds use modern materials like laminates and plexi-chromes.

#### **Siskan "Father Shot" Musket**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

Fanatical theologians dominate the feudal world of Sisk and recorded in the records of their colonial founding is the admonishment that Siskan defence is "built upon the bones of our forefathers". No weapon better lives up to the character of this world than does the gruesome, yet undeniably beautiful, Siskan musket.

Formed in the main from a human thighbone, traditionally from one of the wielder's ancestors, this exquisite firearm is a highly desirable object in many noble circles. Utilising an iron-capped tooth as its striking mechanism, the "Father Shot" is considered to be a reliable weapon with a reputation for lucky hits. In certain seedy areas of Sisk, down on their luck artificers are willing to create trophy muskets from bones brought to them by well-paying worlders. They seldom ask where the materials come from, as their patrons all too often have the steely glint of revenge in their eyes.

**Siskan "Father Shot" Musket**

# **Vibe Spear**

**Class:** Thrown (Primitive)

This nasty weapon, haling from Endrite, appears to be a simple spear of fresh-cut wood to the untrained eye. However, any scrutiny of the spearhead reveals tiny backwards-curving barbed thorns protruding from the fibrous point. Once the wielder sinks this weapon into the target, the barbs bite deep and the thorned head may break off in the wound, and any subsequent movement sees the barbs dig deeper into the flesh. The Endrites use vibe spears to bleed and wear down prey animals. Removing the barbed point from human flesh, without further harm, is a delicate business.

Any living creature injured by a vibe spear must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or also suffer 1 level of Fatigue. Successfully removing the spear requires a Challenging (+0) Medicae Test, with failure inflicting a further 1d5 Damage which does not get reduced by Toughness or Armour.

#### **Volonx Bone Bolas**

#### **Class:** Thrown (Primitive)

A bolas consists of two or three stone or metal weights joined

#### **Crowe, Leader of the Five Great Tribes Volonx**

A failed agri-world long ago regressed to a feral state and dominated by harsh, rolling steppe and windswept grasslands, Volonx has for centuries been the domain of nomadic tribes of scavengers. For generations these tribes have clashed and warred for water and salvage rights, but seldom for conquest. However, this has changed in recent times with the coming of Warlord Crowe.

Having risen to prominence in his native tribe, the young and charismatic warrior seized leadership by killing his predecessor in an honour duel and set about training his warriors into a disciplined fighting force of a kind unknown on Volonx. In only a few short years he has wielded his army to great effect, conquering and unifying five other major tribes under his banner, and in turn forcing his enemies into rival alliances or supplication to survive.

Some herald Crowe as a saviour, the "Sky-Emperor's" chosen, but others call him a butcher in league with evil spirits. Regardless, there is no mistaking his ambition. The Volonx grasslands are vast and whilst it will be many years before Crowe will be able to claim full dominion over the entire world, none doubt that he will try.

together by cords. When a thrown bolas strikes a target, the weights wind around the target's extremities, tangling them up and preventing the target from escaping or getting any closer! Bolas can be found on many feral worlds in the Imperium.

The Volonx version of this weapon works on a similar principal; the weights are made from bone and are embedded with Sand Shark teeth to make them deadlier than a traditional bolas. Some nomad tribes have also been known to coat the cords in a poison made from virulent skem plant stem. When it contacts the skin, it sends the unfortunate target into anaphylactic shock.

#### **Volonx Thunderclap**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Thunderclap)

The tribal warriors of Volonx are famed for their strange scavenged weapons. Perhaps the strangest (and most suicidal) employed by these innovative fighters is the thunderclap. A thrown weapon with a surprisingly good range, the thunderclap is a carved from a light piece of hollow wood with a 45 degree bend about a third of the way along its length. At each end, a fearsome piece of sharpened bone juts out, whilst the innards are packed with a primitive and volatile explosive that detonates when striking a hardened surface. When thrown, the weapon flies in a wide circular arc and returns to the thrower if it does not strike a target, who then may (if brave and nimble enough) catch it again without blowing themselves to pieces!

Catching a missed thunderclap is a Challenging (+0) Agility Test. Failing this Test by three or more degrees will result in an Explosive Mishap (see page 137 of Dark Heresy).

#### **Notable Feral and Feudal Worlds of the Calixis Sector**

#### **Acreage**

A world divided into innumerable feudal demesnes, where armoured nobles clash and the people suffer under an oppressive serfdom. Acreage was formerly ruled over by the High King of the Grand Realm of Ascandia, but is currently in the grip of long-running and bloody war of succession. The years of misrule and desolation are taking their toll, as the planet's level of technology is starting to backslide from its high medieval zenith—a matter not helped by the merciless extraction of its Imperial tithe regardless of local conditions.

#### **Coseflame**

A small, inhabited planetoid riven with deep chasms and gorges criss-crossing its surface, Coseflame is sometimes known as the "cracked world" due to its appearance from space. Nevertheless, Coseflame supports a burgeoning human population who have developed numerous "chasm-city" states, driven by steam power and black powder, that constantly bicker and fight one another. Many off-world traders and agents can be encountered in the numerous marketplaces, bartering sophisticated goods and weapons for the wondrous crystals and rare ores the planetoid is famed for.

#### **Endrite**

The savage feral populace of Endrite worships the ruined hulk of a crashed Imperial battlecruiser as their shrine to the God-Emperor. The Endrites are viewed as expendable by the sub-sector authorities and the planet's population is sizable enough to have supported the raising of several barbarous Imperial Guard regiments over the years. The world itself is provisionally marked for heavy industrial works and exploitation by the powers of nearby Baraspine.

#### **Fervious**

A truly marginalised world accessed only by turbulent warp routes, Fervious has long suffered in its isolation from the wider sector. Once a developed civilization with a sizable population, some say its masters offended the Cult Mechanicus who cursed them and turned their backs on Fervious, dooming it to suffer without the Omnissiah's blessings. Whatever the truth of this tale, the centuries have seen the world rapidly decay and turn inward, and now the bulk of what remains of its people live out a barbaric existence in one vast sprawling shanty city amid the ruins of better days. Fervious's regression has spawned a very violent culture that relies on ritual murder to gain wealth and status. It is a world where life is cheap, brutality commonplace and death cults and doomsday prophets are rife.

#### **Faldon Kise**

This primitive frontier world lies close the Halo Stars and its tiny population is descended from generations of voiders marooned for past crimes. Spread across three small settlements, clusted around a single automated watch station that marks the Imperium's outer boundary, the people of Kise have a well-deserved reputation as untrustworthy and devolved savages and mutation is rife among them.

#### **Monrass**

This lush and verdant backwater world features diverse landscapes, from snowy peninsulas to arid deserts unspoiled by industry or exploitation. Monrass is populated by burgeoning archaic empires that predate the Angevin Crusade and have only in recent centuries mastered iron-smelting and chariot combat. The planet's "governor" is an Administratum satrap, sitting in an high orbital tithing station, who interferes only to occasionally levy troops and foodstuffs for the Imperium's due, while the only other off-worlders known to the people are a handful of missionaries determined to bring the Emperor's light to the benighted natives.

### <span id="page-96-0"></span>Melee Weapons Me lee Weapons

*"You see this dagger, off-worlder? I made this dagger. I killed the beast whose teeth make up this blade. You come here with your pretty guns that make pretty flashes, but I earned my weapon… did you?"*

— Crowe, Leader of the Five Great Tribes.

L ike primitive ranged weapons, melee weapons are almost always fashioned from common materials native to the world of their manufacture. Typical materials include horn, stone or bone. However, iron, bronze and even copper may also serve as materials on more advanced worlds. L

#### **New Quality: Fast**

The size and speed of this weapon makes it hard to Parry. Opponents that would Parry an attack against a weapon with the Fast quality take a –20 penalty on their Weapon Skill Tests.

#### **Bastard Sword**

**Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The bastard sword, or hand-and-a-half, finds the most use among the Harrowguard, an elite core of Iocanthos warriors in the employ of Warlord Vervai Skull. So called because the blade falls between the more traditional longsword and the far larger two-handed sword, having a long blade and heavy weight prevents all but the best trained warriors from wielding it one-handed. To accommodate all users, these weapons feature a longer grip to provide flexibility, giving the wielder the option to use it one or two-handed.

#### **Bucklers**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Bucklers are small shields used to attain some degree of protection without sacrificing mobility. The buckler's small size makes it inadequate for protecting against primitive ranged weapons such as arrows or crossbow bolts. However, it is effective for deflecting blows from hand-to-hand weapons. Some bucklers have a large barbed spike or point mounted on the outside and so can also be used offensively.

On Acreage, buckler-style weapons have developed with small metal spikes protruding from the shield's edge, transforming a generally protective item into a deadly weapon. Acreage bucklers have identical stats to normal bucklers but may also be thrown with a range of 8-metres.

#### **Chain-Sticks, Fervious**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Chain-Sticks)

Chain-sticks are made from two batons, linked together by a length of tough sinew. Variations on this design, especially on other more advanced worlds, feature a tough chain and steel construction. On Fervious, the ends of the batons are coated with venom harvested from the deadly Fervious serpent. Consequently, a wielder must be skilled to avoid poisoning himself while trying to strike his enemy.

#### **Cutlass**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

This short and heavy bladed weapon is most popular with naval officers and crews, and can be found on feudal worlds throughout the Imperium. Designed for close-quarter fighting, it is a simple weapon, relying on the wielder's brute strength rather than finesse or skill. When found among officers in the Imperial Navy, cutlasses are enhanced with power fields and other technological improvements.

#### **Double Flail, Penolpass**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Double Flail)

The lithe, dancing warriors of Penolpass use a weapon known as a double flail as their primary weapon. The weapon has an unusual structure, consisting of two spiked heads attached to chains affixed on either end of a stout wooden shaft. Given the complexity of this weapon, using it effectively requires a great deal of skill. The true masters of the weapon those of the Penolpassian Blood Order—can make its use a deadly, though beautiful, dance. In rare cases, the weapon's shaft can split to produce two smaller flails.

**Double Flail, Penolpass**

# III: Feral & Feudal Worlds

#### **Lightning Chain, Acreage**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Lightning Chain)

Acreage is the birthplace of the lightning chain, though this strange weapon has now spread to other worlds. At a glance, it appears to be a length of spiked chain measuring about one to one and a half metres. Closer inspection reveals that the chain is fashioned from a unique alloy found only on Acreage. It somehow "stores" kinetic energy, which is released in the form of bluecoloured energy sparks when the chain moves with any kind of sharp, excessive force. When properly used in combat, victims of a lightning chain attack not only receive dreadful lacerations and broken bones, but also suffer burns from the writhing energy fields that "spark" when the chain is in motion.

So dangerous are these weapons that not even the wielders are safe from the arcing energy. To avoid burns on the hands, lightning chain users wear thick gloves made from the tough hides of grox-like animals found on Acreage. The durable leather provides some insulation from the energy generated by the chain's movements.

**Lightning Gauntlet**

#### **Lightning Gauntlets, Acreage**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Lightning Gauntlets)

Made from the same metal alloys as the Acreage lightning chain, the gauntlets are much rarer as they require far more skill to create. As the gauntlets cannot be swung as fast as the lightning chain, the kinetic effe ct is lessened. Still, being struck in the face by a lightning gauntlet is likely to do some serious damage or even kill the unfortunate on the end of the punch. A layer of the same hides used by lightning chain wielders can be found inside the gauntlets affording the same kind of protection.

#### **Long-Sabre, Fervious**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The Fervious long-sabre is a long, curved sword requiring two hands to wield. It is sharper than many other swords since the metal of Fervious is a very stubborn and hard material, folded many times to create a razor-sharp edge. Only weapons with power fields or monofilament blades can hope to surpass a long-sabre's fine edge.

Long-sabres are wielded by nobles of Fervious, but can also be found among the many death cults of that world. Fervious's society is very bloodthirsty, founded on ritual murder as a means to gain status and wealth. Thus all nobles are usually armed with these weapons to ward off assassins and other would-be usurpers.

#### **Sepherin Mirror Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Made famous by the Royal Scourges of Sepheris Secundus, the mirror shield is an ornate rectangular device capable of covering about two-thirds of its wielder's body. Constructed from layers of metal and stained crystal—silicate glass, baring the colourful crests and armorials of the nobility, the refractive glass gives the shield a mirrored effect known to repel las weapon shots of low strength. As such, it is considered an exemplar of ennobled warfare and "affairs of honour" on a world were such advanced weapons are restricted to the elite retainers of the ruling barons.

If used as cover against ranged attacks, the shield is large enough to protect the arm it is carried in and one other location (usually the body) providing AP 8 (Primitive). Thanks to its special construction sepherin mirror shield retains its full AP value against las weapons.

#### **Moon Blades, Balecarne**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Moon blades are primarily used by the elite Crescent Brotherhood of the Balecarne tribe, who originate from the feral world of Munsk, located in the Josian Reach. Over time, the tribe has spawned sister-tribes on the neighbouring worlds in the system.

Moon blades are two crescent-shaped blades, each about 30 centimetres in length. The wielder holds a blade in each hand, gripping it in the centre—usually a piece of leather is wrapped around the middle of the blade to protect the wielder's hands. The points of the crescent point outwards, away from the wielder's body. Moon Blades are difficult to use, taking many years to fully master. Experts, especially members of the Crescent Brotherhood, can wield the blades with deadly force and may also use them as short-range throwing weapons.

#### **The Knights of the Star Sanctum**

Balecaster is a feudal planet located in the Markyn Marches of the Calixis Sector. It is currently at a pre-black powder level of technology. The planet has three continents, only two of which are inhabited. The central continent is dominated by a single kingdom, ruled by the ageing King Regent, Tileon. The Regent has governed for many years, well over his natural lifespan, which continues to cause much contention among the nobles, including Tileon's son (who has spent seventy years patiently waiting to take the throne). Rumours persist that the king has been using off-world technology to prolong his life, though this is strongly denied by those closest to him.

In spite of whispered plans of treason or rumours about the king's son mustering an army to take the throne by force, nothing has yet happened because of the Star Sanctum. The Knights of the Star Sanctum are an elite order of trident-armed warriors, decked in all-encasing bloodshine armour. They are the most powerful force on Balecaster and to go against the king would bring down the fury of the Star Sanctum.

The Star Sanctum's origins are murky at best and there are numerous explanations about how they came into existence, many of which are at odds with one another. By far the most popular story is that the knights were once a warrior cult comprised of the best warriors from amongst the primitive tribes that roamed the world's central continent. While it's not clear what brought these warriors together—the most contentious part of their legends—what is known is that they met in a hidden chamber far below the planet's surface, a place known as the Star Sanctum. There, the knights codified the purpose of their order and mastered the fighting arts of their preferred weapons. Their detractors claim that far more than just their fighting style originated from this legendary chamber, and all sorts of stories about human sacrifice, worship of unspeakable forces and perverted rituals abound. That the knights remain silent on their origins does little to refute these claims, though their fierce reputation is enough to keep their enemies from voicing their theories in a more public forum.

#### **Punch Dagger**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A punch dagger is a simple weapon consisting of a blade mounted onto the hand in a way similar to how brass knuckles are worn. While not as efficient as swords or larger weapons, a punch dagger is an invaluable aid when fighting in confined quarters and tight spaces, where more traditional weapons would prove to be a liability.

#### **Sabre**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A favoured weapon of cavalry troops and other mounted warriors, commonplace on worlds such as Iocanthos and Volonx, a sabre is a sword with a long, curved, singleedged blade. The weapon's excellent balance allows riders to keep a hand free to control their mounts, and its utility and effectiveness make it a very responsive weapon in skilled hands. Sabres persist in use in far more sophisticated climes and are popular with many Imperial Guard officers and hive nobles, often featuring mono edge blades and even power field generators to enhance their effectiveness.

#### **Scythe**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Although principally an agri-tool, scythes have a history of "double duty" as weapons. Generally, they are far from practical in this respect, being unwieldy and ineffective against all but the most inexperienced opponents. Instead, scythes find their most common use as props in rituals or to convey a specific image. For instance, Inquisitor Gard Justarcker of the Callixian Conclave is known to wield a scythe wreathed in red, crackling energy bands.

#### **Spetum**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A spetum is a pole-arm equipped with three single-edged prongs on the "business" end. Most commonly found on Balecaster, it serves as a ceremonial weapon by the Inner Guard of the Star Sanctum. Although the opportunity to use these weapons in combat is somewhat rare, the warriors who form the Inner Guard are highly trained in its use, having spent countless hours honing their technique to achieve complete mastery.

#### **Steam Drill**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

These bulky, temperamental devices are primitive mining rigs used on worlds such as Sepheris Secundus and Coseflame, where more sophisticated tools, like the breacher units favoured by the Mechanicus, would be impossible to maintain. Powered by a weighty, scolding hot, backpack steam-compressor that serves to turn a huge boring drill-bit, they are not intended as weapons, however, are capable of inflicting very serious damage should an unfortunate get in the way of the drill head.

Steam drills require a Strength Bonus of 4 or more to be used effectively as a weapon. Weaker characters suffer a –10 WS penalty for each point of Strength Bonus below 4. Such is the bulk of a Steam Drill that they impose a –10 to Agility while carried.

#### **Stiletto**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A long dagger equipped with a narrow blade, stilettos are designed for easy concealment and also for driving deep into the flesh to pierce vital organs. A stiletto is not designed for prolonged combats, but rather to give the wielder a chance to eliminate his foe quickly and quietly. Stilettos are found throughout feudal worlds, especially in places where heavy armour sees widespread use, since these weapons are capable of slipping between heavy plates to reach the tender flesh within.

#### **Tower Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A tower shield is an immense shield of wood or metal, used to provide a mobile barrier more than an active defence. Simple plated iron examples are a common sight in the canyons and narrow passageways of Coseflame, while the inlaid bronze and wood shields found on Monrass are considered works of art in their own right.

Tower shields can be used as cover rather than as body armour; a re-enforced wooden version provides 6 AP (Primitive) while a sturdier, solid metal one provides 8 AP (Primitive). They are bulky and very unwieldy items and impose a penalty of –2 to the Agility Bonus of their users.

Armours of feral worlds tend to be of natural materials including wood, hides and bone, while feudal worlds benefit from a deeper understanding of metallurgy and may incorporate tougher substances in their protective gear. Iron or steel are the standards, though some worlds may use bronze or even copper. A

#### **Banded Armour, Fervious**

The banded armour of Fervious is made from layers of tough, laminated strips of hide, bonded or sewn to cushioned leather. The armour has been developed to stop the razorsharp Fervious long-sabres. The banded armour is also highly effective against primitive ranged weapons, but struggles against more advanced technology. Normally, the suits are worn by warriors and nobles who constantly fear for their lives due to Fervious's callous culture—where murder is an accepted form of dispatching rivals.

#### **Bone Armour**

On many feral worlds the strongest material available is bone, and so it falls to this crude substance to provide some measure of protection. Bone armour is made from the skeletal remains of beasts. The design and shape is wholly dependant on the world it originated on and the type of animal bones used.

There are a few common themes, no matter where the armour was made; the skull is usually hollowed out and serves as the helmet, while ribcages and thick bone plates form the breastplate. Sometimes the armour is dressed in furs and hides, but, more often than not, the bone is on full display to give the wearer a fearsome appearance.

#### **Bracers**

Bracers are worn on the wrists and may be made from hide, leather or metal. They serve a dual purpose in offering a mild element of protection, turning the blade of a dagger or sword, as well as assisting archers to steady their wrist when drawing a bowstring.

Like many types of armour, bracers are often decorated, from finely carved and intricate designs, to being inlaid with precious stones and metals to show the owner's wealth. Like many primitive items, bracers have found their way into Imperial society, primarily as a fashion item but often as a way of disguising useful gadgets like refractor or field generators, or even hidden communications devices.

### **Heavy Plate Armour**

A certain metallurgy technological base is needed before allencasing plate armour can be developed. Such heavy armour affords greater protection and is known to be able to stand low-level las weapon blasts. However, plate armour is heavy and very uncomfortable to wear. Full sets of plate armour are considered to be of great value by certain collectors throughout the Imperium. On worlds capable of developing this armour, it tends to be worn only by nobles and the most elite of warriors.

#### **Scale Armou r, Mon rass**

The Scar Dragons are in danger of vanishing on Monrass since their scales are valued for the construction of a particularly durable form of armour. Despite their fearsome nature, men, eager to reap the rewards that the creatures' skin can bring, have hunted Scar Dragons to near extinction. Once killed, the hunters skin the dragon and drag off the carcass to be sold as meat (which is very tough but considered a delicacy on and off-world). The scales are turned into suits of armour. It is a highly skilled job that can only be performed by a member of the Scale Jakkers Guild. The manufacture of such armour takes many months, as each scale needs to be properly aligned and then bonded to the tough hide that forms the basis of the suit.

Once complete, a suite of scale armour is very valuable and offers the wearer significant protection against both primitive and advanced weapons. The scales seem to be especially resistant to weapons that agitate air molecules to create heat, such as melta weapons. Some, who have witnessed the effectiveness of the armour have spoken of establishing a captive dragon population off-world in order farm the creatures for their desirable skin.

In addition to the normal benefits conferred by wearing this armour, wearers gain a +10 bonus on Agility Tests made to avoid catching fire.

#### **Scrag Furs**

Formed from the hide of the ill-tempered and ill-smelling Scrag Bear, this armour is cheaper than other types of fur due to its distinctive stench. Somewhere between rancid ham and vomit, the wearer of scrag fur is not a popular fellow. A character wearing scrag furs takes a –10 penalty on all Fellowship Tests.

#### **Silkmail, A c reage**

Chainmail is a staple defence on many feudal worlds throughout the Imperium and some of the finest examples of chainmail in the Calixis sector is the work of the artisans of Acreage. Far finer and lighter than common mail and entirely more comfortable, silkmail (as it is known) is favoured by the nobility and highly prized by off-world collectors.

F eral and feudal gear tends to involve the sorts of items and equipment that help people to survive in the often hostile environments of their worlds. Including a selection of hunting and foraging equipment, as well as items that reflect the customs and beliefs of feral and feudal warriors, the gear here supplements the items found in Dark Heresy. F

#### **Braid Cloak, Fedrid**

The hunters of Fedrid rarely go tracking without wearing a braid cloak. The cloak is made from the tough hide of a large herbivorous creature, called the Ungorth, which has evolved a tough hide to repel the sharp claws of its predators. The braid cloak is worn by hunters to protect against similar attacks, as the predators that fall from the trees on Fedrid are not particularly choosy about what they attack. Hunters often incorporate vines, leaves and other vegetation for camouflage. Outside of the Fedrid jungles, the cloak's value is somewhat lessened.

A braid cloak grants a +10 bonus on Concealment Tests when worn in forest or jungle terrain. In addition, the cloak grants 1 Armour Point to the Body. The protection provided counts as Primitive.

#### **Caltrops, Fervious**

The caltrop is a small, four-pointed spike, left on the ground for intended targets to step upon. Fervious caltrops are often coated in the venom of the feared Fervious serpent. Should the target step on the caltrops, they face a prolonged and agonising death unless anti-venom is nearby.

Caltrops are sold in quantities enough to blanket a two metre by two metre area.

Anyone walking on Fervious caltrops without at least 1 Armour Point on their feet counts as being hit by a weapon with the Toxic special quality. In addition, those walking across caltrops must succeed on a Difficult (–10) Agility Test. A success halves movement, while a failed Test quarters movement. The reduced speed lasts until the victim receives medical treatment.

#### **Monrassan Capsican Trap**

Used on the feral world of Monrass to break up the masses of soldiers used in the battles between its rival empires, these primitive land mines are surprisingly effective devices. Simply made from fragile clay pots and filled with a mixture of spinethorns, lamp oil and spay-burner grubs (an indigenous insect filled with a pyretic acid), the mines are placed in a shallowdug hole and covered with a thin layer of earth. When stood upon, the pot breaks causing the victim to be gouged by the spine-thorns and rupturing the spay-burner's bloated bodies, causing severe and painful acid burns, and igniting their clothing with sticky, burning ichor. Feral regiments raised for the Imperial Guard from Monrass have taken this weapon with them, even going so far as to take breeding nests of burner grubs with them on campaign, much to their Munitorum quartermasters' dismay.

#### **The Beasts of Fedrid**

Fedrid's impenetrable jungles are home to many dangerous and exotic beasts that lure off-world hunters to risk life and limb on this death world. Those who dare descend through its humid atmosphere find a hostile planet seething in an eternal battle of predator and prey, where even the herbivores are aggressive, attacking with the slightest provocation. The dangers are legion, ranging from the tiny but insidious flesh boring rot worms, to lurking pit-biles hiding beneath the loam with snapping jaws like mantraps, to thorn-back reptiles the size of Imperial Guard battle tanks.

Of the varied predators haunting the emerald jungles, the "tree-jumpers" are the best known. Six-limbed mantids the size of an adult man, they have massive slicing claws on the end of each appendage and clusters of compound eyes that keep them appraised of approaching prey. They dwell in the high canopy, leaping from tree to tree, ceaselessly hunting for their next meal. When they spot a likely victim, they silently drop from above, claws splayed, to land on the back of the unfortunate creature. They bite and slash, shredding flesh and rapidly devouring their meals before the spilt blood attracts the attention of larger beasts. While most tree-jumpers are solitary, packs of these horrors are not unknown and entire expeditions have been slaughtered by these savage beasts, particularly if their breeding nests are disturbed by the unwary explorer.

Of all of the monstrous creatures great and small, none are so fabled or so prized as a trophy as the Sa'vak; or the "black death" as it is also known, perhaps the greatest horror of Fedrid. The undisputed masters of the jungle, they are massive creatures, growing up to tens of metres in length. Capable of standing dormant and utterly indistinguishable from dead or petrified tree-boughs until their prey draws close, then their fibrous carapace opens up to reveal dozens of saw-toothed tendrils, poisoned barbs and vast beaked jaws proven to be able to slice a carapace-armoured man in half. Phenomenally fast for its size and all but imposable to kill, the Sa'vak is Fedrid's most highly sought prize, but one that has lured innumerable would-be hunters to their death.

Perhaps the most dangerous of predators on Fedrid, ironically of course, are human. Whether the well-armed expeditions of the jaded Scintillan nobility or the dark-eyed feral natives who serve as their guides, when they pass beyond the high compound walls of their hunting lodges, the only thing that attracts mankind to Fedrid is the scent of the kill.

Anyone stepping on a Capsican Trap must make a Difficult (–10) Agility Test. Failure indicates that they have set it off, causing 1D10 E Damage to their legs. A second, Challenging (+0), Agility Test determines if the victim has also caught on fire.

#### **Feral Healer's Kit**

On feral worlds, healers rely upon herbs, poultices and other primitive methods to tend to their patients. A typical kit will contain the following: seep moss to staunch bleeding, stitchticks to close wounds, sleep bark to numb pain, splints and soft leather bandages, bone tweezers and flint knife, and a heavy cosh for untreatable cases.

#### **Feudal Healer's Kit**

On feudal worlds, there is usually a modicum of medical theory and surgical techniques, often taught by secretive guilds or academic schools. Occasionally there are folk practitioners using ancient wisdom and common sense, however, most of these are usually burnt as witches. A typical healer's kit would contains the following items: leeches to staunch bleeding, needle and thread to close wounds, alchemical tincture to numb pain, cloth bandages, splints and plaster, metal scalpel, probes, clamps and pliers, saw for amputations and a stout leather apron to stop the stains.

#### **Glo-slugs of Dusk**

In the foetid swamps of Dusk swim the glo-slugs, brown and black gastropods of an unremarkable nature. Like much of Dusk's native fauna, the slugs are carnivorous and spend their lives searching for dead creatures to slime over and digest. However, when removed from the water, the slug's skin emanates a phosphorous white glow. Placing two or more slugs together dramatically increases the illumination. The inhabitants of Dusk place three or four slugs together in a jar to give off a very bright light to help them illuminate the marshy hunting grounds.

Each slug illuminates a one metre radius area. The light from multiple glo-slugs is cumulative, so two will shed light out to two metre s, three to three metres, and so on.

This natural light source can prove useful in numerous situations where there is no power or where null-fields have been installed, preventing torches and other illuminating devices from working.

#### **Hunting Musk**

Tribal hunters are all too aware of the acute senses of their prey. Accordingly, many smear themselves with stench-laden pastes to disguise their natural body odour. Made from all manner of foulness (on which it is best not to dwell), nevertheless, such pastes are a useful tool. Creatures that rely on smell to detect their prey take a –20 penalty on Perception Tests made to detect characters wearing hunting musk. An application of hunting musk lasts for 1d10 hours.

#### **Kill Sticks, Volonx**

Volonx kill sticks are used in booby traps and consist of a sharpened stick made from bamboo or mono-plastics. They work best when employed in groups, often based within a hidden pit or trench. Anyone stepping into an area of kill sticks must succeed on an Agility Test or take 1d10+2 R points of Damage.

#### **Powder Bombs, Fervious**

Created by the death cults of Fervious, an ignited powder bomb unleashes a white powder throughout a 30-metre radius. The powder reduces visibility and the pollens used to make the powder are toxic to humans. Inhaling the powder is rarely lethal. However, it will inflame the eyes, nose and throat, and induces serious nausea, all of which takes a good few hours to clear.

The cloud of powder disperses at a rate appropriate to the environmental conditions. A strong wind clears the area in 1 Round. Indoors, the powder settles after 2d10 Rounds.

Powder bombs are Thrown weapons with a Range of 10m and have the Smoke quality. Those caught within the blast must Test Toughness or gain one level of Fatigue.

#### **Skeleton Keys**

On feudal worlds, the locks of many castles (and sometimes whole towns) have been designed so that one master key, known as the skeleton key, can open them. Given that most primitive locks operate on the same basic mechanism, those who wish easy ingress often keep a collection of such keys on hand.

#### **Skem Net, Volonx**

A skem net is made from strips of plant stem harvested from the poisonous skem plant. A typical net is usually six metres square. The stem of the skem plant is notoriously hardy and so the net can actually be packed up quite tight, to about the size of a man's balled fist. On Volonx, hunters launch the net with the aid of an arrow. The net is coated in skem poison that causes anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in it to be sent into anaphylactic shock unless the antidote is administered within ten minutes. This also means that the owner of the net must always use gloves and avoid skin contact when repacking it.

Use the Toxic and Snare rules when the net is deployed.

#### **Sleep Dust, Zillman's Domain**

Harvested on Zillman's Domain, the apothecaries found that crushing the seeds of an innocuous red and black flowered plant created a potent soporific powder. Inhaling the dust would drop a full-grown human in a matter of minutes and allow them to sleep dreamlessly for hours. Apart from feeling slightly drowsy for another couple hours afterwards, there are no other short- or long-term effects. The powder is tasteless and is often administered by being stirred into food.

Inhaling or ingesting sleep dust forces a character to make a Difficult (–10) Toughness Test or 1d10 minutes later fall into a deep sleep for 1d5–TB hours.

#### **Smoke Flares, Fedrid**

Fedrid smoke flares are made from the hollowed-out spines of a native cactus-like plant. The spines are filled with white cotton that, when lit, gives off a high yield of thick black, acrid smoke over an area of up to 40 metres. The smoke disperses at a rate appropriate to the environmental conditions. A strong wind clears the area in 1d5 Rounds; indoors, the smoke clears after 2d10 minutes.

#### **Sour Mud, Endrite**

The substance known as sour mud is found on the beds of dormant tar pits on the feral world Endrite. It is used by shamans and witch doctors for healing and can be used in poultices, placed directly onto a wound to staunch bleeding or even diluted with hot water and ingested to reduce fevers although it is said to taste foul!

Studies show the putty-like substance is rich in minerals and contains strong anti-bacterial agents. Rumours abound of an interested corporation wishing to build a large industrial complex on the tar pits to harvest and export the substance off-world.

A medic using sour mud gains a +10 bonus on Medicae Tests when treating diseases and fevers and may use the substance to stop Blood Loss as a Full Action.

#### **Spark Rocks**

Spark rocks are small white crystals that work like flint and steel. Striking the rocks together creates sparks. Creating the sparks over tinder, such as animal hair, wood shavings or dried dung, makes a flame that can be nursed into a campfire or used to light a torch. Spark rocks can even be used when wet.

It is best not to store the rocks together as even the slightest contract can produce sparks. Inexperienced users have been known to set their packs alight by keeping two or more spark rocks in the same bag.

#### **Spine Pick, Faldon Kise**

Spine picks are useful tools created from the tough spikes that protrude from the hide of the Gar-keeler, a giant porcupine-like creature that inhabits the jungles of the frontier world Faldon Kise in the Malfian sub-sector. Once the creature is slaughtered and its spines removed, the base of the spines are bevelled into a crude handle, leaving the sharp spike tip in place.

The pick can be used as a basic, improvised weapon. However, its primary role is that of a climbing aid. A spine pick grants a +10 bonus on all Climb Tests.

#### **Stink Bombs**

These are used on a variety of primitive worlds, although the most renowned are those from the planet of Munsk. Created by collecting the faeces of a large worm-like creature, the excrement is then mixed with virulent pollen from the yellowpetalled plant known locally as the "dung-bloom" for its distinctive odour. The mixture is then balled up and encased in a dried mud shell. Once the fragile mud-shell is cracked an intolerable stench is released (an eight metre diameter per bomb). Most humans will not be able to stand the odour and must vacate the area or experience severe nausea and even loss of consciousness if they suffer prolonged exposure.

Anyone exposed to a stink bomb must succeed on a Toughness Test each Round or gain one level of Fatigue.

#### **Syckle Oil, Tygress V**

Made from linn seeds found only on the feral world of Tygress V, syckle oil can be used on any metal blade. The oil coats the blade giving it a bright sheen and making the metal all but frictionless. It will also prevent rust and tarnishing. Weaponsmiths use the oil on simple mechanisms, such as flintlock triggers, to prevent them jamming.

Applying syckle oil to a bladed melee weapon or primitive firearm allows the user to re-roll any failed Test that would result in it being broken or Jammed. An application of the oil lasts for 1d10+4 attacks with the weapon or 12 hours, whichever comes first.

#### **Fedrid Soul Mask**

These ornate, bizarre and often frightening masks are employed by the native hunters of Fedrid as a sinister form of defence. Soaked in the blood of beasts (and some say ritually murdered rivals), these outsized masks are worn on the back with the common belief that the trapped soul within will flinch with anticipation if danger stalks up behind the wearer. Unsurprisingly these macabre items of "primitive art" grace the walls of many a private study on Scintilla and elsewhere and fetch high prices. The stories of strange hauntings, bloody histories and native curses clinging to such masks only adds to the frisson of owning one for some.

# Miscellany Miscellany

<span id="page-105-0"></span>One major difference between primitive and advanced worlds is in the services a traveller might find or require. As with the gear and weaponry to be found on primitive worlds, the lifestyles and comforts are downright primitive too. O

#### **Consumables** Consumables

Much of what primitive world folk consume defies description, and sometimes taste! What follows is a brief sample of the more palatable offerings.

#### **Belly-churn**

Popular with nomadic peoples, the belly-churn is an animal stomach filled with milk, sewn shut and then flung over the side of a riding beast to slowly curdle. The resulting cheese is regarded as a delicacy and also keeps "fresh" a remarkably long time, making it the ideal ration for a lengthy journey.

#### **Spirit Tonic, Munsk**

Originating from the planet of Munsk in the Josian Reach, spirit tonic is an alcoholic brew produced mainly on the northern continent. Its ingredients are not wildly known, though, there are rumours that the corpses of the small rodents dominating that area of the planet may be the primary ingredient, however, such whispers have yet to be proven. Regardless, steed tonic is infamous for its wretched flavour, inspiring many theories about just what exactly is in it.

Known to its detractors as "coward juice", consuming a measure of this foul fluid inspires a degree of "courage" to the imbiber. The natives of Munsk believe a swig can dull the pangs of fear and thus nearly all warriors drink the fluid before hunting, waging war or confronting their spouse.

This vile concoction conceals a powerful narcotic poison, once ingested it grants a +10 bonus on all Fear Tests made for the next 1d5 hours. However, it impairs judgment, inflicting a –10 penalty on all Intelligence based Tests during this period. This substance is also addictive and more than capable of inflicting permanent brain damage in a frequent user.

#### **Styger Milk, Fervious**

The Styger is a beast of burden found on Fervious. Shortly after a Styger gives birth to a whelp, it produces a viscous fluid on which its young feeds. So thick is this vile substance that when a human consumes it, the milk coats the throat, windpipe and stomach for up to a day after being ingested. As well as being full of nutrients and proteins, the people of Fervious have found that the milk engenders resilience to poisons and toxins.

The Styger milk is so effective at neutralizing toxins that all Fervious's nobles, as a matter of course, drink it before eating. This has led to substantial trade for Styger dairy farmers who, before the discovery of the milk's benefits, were nothing more

than just peasants. Now the dairy farmers have grown rich and powerful in their own right, fighting amongst themselves in the hopes of gaining a monopoly.

Anyone who drinks a dose of Styger milk gains a +20 Resistance to ingested poisons. The effects of Styger milk last for 1d5 hours, however, its long-term effects can be unpleasant, and aside from degrading the user's sense of taste, every time it is used the drinker must take a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer 1 point of permanent Toughness Damage.

#### **Services** Services

Lacking the amenities found on more advanced worlds, most people of the Imperium have little to no idea of how to deal with ordinary troubles when they find themselves on a feral or feudal world. Hence, those offering particular services to off-worlders can make a lucrative living.

#### **Guard**

Hired muscle can guard a camp, an object or even your very life if sufficiently motivated. The price of a guard can vary greatly (at the GMs discretion) depending on their ability and disposition.

#### **Guide**

Whether a cunning huntsman, streetwise link-boy or turncoat tribesman, a guide is invaluable in navigating the foetid forests of a feral world or the narrow streets of a feudal city.

#### **Medicae (Feral)**

Using a mixture of faith, luck and herbal remedies, a feral world healer is often the shaman of the local tribe, or else an experienced mother who knows all manner of folk cures. Smoke, prayer, insects and strange fungi are common components of feral world medicine.

### **Medicae (Feudal)**

Equipped with tools such as scalpels, pliers and leeches, a doctor from a feudal world can heal a character with but an average amount of mummery, unpleasant cures and guess work.

#### **Parasite Removal**

Whether it's a flea-ridden feudal king or a worm-raddled forest warrior, sooner or later, people on primitive worlds need their parasites removed. Treatments can vary a great deal and may include mysterious methods such as smoke baths, sand scrubs, lice combs, purgatives and other less savoury practices.

#### **Porters**

Hired from the local populace, often for little more than the price of a meal, porters can carry an unfeasibly large amount of goods and equipment upon their shoulders.

#### **Trophy Maker**

On many primitive worlds, the inhabitants take trophies from notable kills, dead relatives or defeated enemies. A visit to the trophy maker sees the object properly preserved for display. From shrunken heads to bleached bones and stuffed animals, all sorts of keepsakes can be made.

*"New to the hive my noble sir? No, don't take me amiss! I'm here to help you, see? Outworlder are we? I can tell of course, not just the accent you understand, or the dress. Not used to the crowds are we sir? Getting buffeted and pushed along like that? Confused? Lost? Why if I hadn't found you you'd be dipped and clipped in the blink of a scarab's eye! You'll feel better out of the press, come along, this isn't a safe level you know?! What a fine specimen you are sir, if you don't mind me saying… 'long of limb and clean of skin' as we say in the inhumation business… this way sir, down here, just one more stairwell… I know some friends of mine that will take to you right off, well, parts of you anyway…"*

— Vargo "Redjack" Heit, Hive Sibellus Viscerator.

This chapter details a wide variety of weapons and equipment that can be found or encountered on the diverse hive worlds of the Calixis Sector. Most hive worlds are manufacturing centres of wide range and colossal output, as well as the homes of billions. They are T

the Imperium at its most frenetic, industrious and unified, but they are also places of great injustice, totalitarian control and savage lawlessness. In their dark recesses hide terrible lurking dangers. Here you'll find the playthings of the rich, desperate weapons of rebellion and the tools of the killer's trade. You'll also come across the base trappings of daily life common to many, black market goods peddled from the shadows and numerous strange technological devices whose workings are far beyond the understanding of those who rely on them.

The Calixis Sector is a place of contrasts and its hives are no less so. Each has its own eccentricities of culture, custom and character, and each soul born there is a reflection of the world that made them. Indeed, the weapons and tools that you'll find here reflect their origins too, be it a finely crafted blade from the sub-sea cities of Landunder or a Voligite Mercy Killer; crudely made and almost as dangerous to the firer as the target.

This chapter is by no means exhaustive. To try and detail every possible weapon or interesting item from just the hives of Calixis would take up hundreds of pages. What you will find here should give you both a useful almanac of hive world weapons and goods, and importantly a flavour of what is like to live and die beneath a steel sky.

*"No Hector, the Adeptus Astartes are the Emperor's angels given form—you couldn't even lift one of their weapons, even when you're all grown-up. But that pretty thing there's meant for us mere mortals to handle, and more than enough to kill any man alive. Now come away from the glass dear, your father's waiting."*

— Jocaster Moncreath of House Moncreath, The Legation Quarter, Malfi.

What follows is a selection of ranged weapons that specifically hail from hive worlds throughout the Calixis Sector. W

#### **Bolt Weapons** Bolt Weapons

#### **Angelus Bolt Carbine**

#### **Class:** Basic (Bolt)

The fanes of Gunmetal, among their most important duties, hold an oath-bond to manufacture the casing and primary propulsion charges for Astartes calibre bolt shells. Production of the Astartes bolts is carefully controlled and monitored, and once made, each case is stamped with the aquila and its maker's mark before being passed on to the Adepts of the Machine God. Despite the security and precautions inherent in this sacred duty, it is said a few of these shells never see the aquila stamp. These so called "blind shells" are both utterly illegal and highly desirable, but on their own, blind shells are useless without a weapon to fire them. Consequently, the Fane of Fykos makes in secret a weapon known as the "Angelus". Bluntly elegant in shape and crafted from the finest materials, the Angelus's lacquered stock houses its magazine and unlocks to take three Astartes calibre bolt shells snugly nose to tail. Provided only to their richest and most trustworthy of clients, the exclusivity and terrible killing power of the Angelus is favoured by the wealthiest of bounty hunters and the most accomplished of beast-slayers in the Calixis Sector. Carrying one of these powerful, but highly illegal weapons entails certain risks all of its own.

#### **Cinder Crag Forge "Mauler" Bolt Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

A singular weapon to say the least, the Mauler is a finely made bolt pistol designed for normal human hands (unlike the far larger, heavier calibre models intended for use by the legendary Space Marines). Extremely sophisticated in design and made by necessity from the finest alloys and components, each Mauler is handmade and forged by the servitor-savants of the Cinder Crag. Each weapon is uniquely tailored to the commissioner's exact biometric data. The result is a weapon as implacably lethal as it is as perfect an artefact.

Mauler pistols made by commission cost twice the listed price and count as Best quality weapons when used by the hand they were crafted for (see Chapter V: Armoury of Dark Heresy).

#### **Volg "Spitfire" Bolt Pistol Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

Little more than a crudely modified Lucifer pattern launcher (a handgun-like device common on frontier worlds for firing signal flares, tow lines and the like), the Spitfire was an innovation that, according to popular myth, was devised by an outcast Magnavar tech-adept named Verey. The story has it that while she was exiled in Volg, she made the first Spitfires to help combat a swarming of giant Maw-flukes. The weapon proved both effective and popular, and the more talented of Volg's arms dealers have been turning them out ever since. The Spitfire's fame and construction has spread and some are even sold at inflated prices as real "bolt pistols" to those too provincial or naive to know better!

Spitfires use modified rocket-propelled distress flares fitted with a crude impact detonators in a pale imitation of a bolt shell, but are nevertheless still quite deadly. Spitfire rounds will ignite flammable materials and on Critical Hits their targets must Test Agility or be set on fire in addition to any other effect.

Spitfire shells are also far from stable and any Jam result automatically incurs an Explosive Mishap (Damage is directed at the firer, who must Test Agility or be set on fire). Likewise if Spitfire ammunition is hit by an explosion or flame weapon, it may detonate (65% chance) dealing 1d10+3 points of Damage to the user.

Spitfire shells are themselves Scarce with a base cost of 5 Thrones per reload.

#### **Aegis-Redback Pattern Heavy Webber**

**Class:** Exotic (Heavy Webber)

The advanced design for this heavy webber is held by the Adeptus Mechanicus of the Lathe System and the weapons themselves are produced only under granted licence by the Hax-Orthlack manufactorums on the sector capital world of Scintilla. Standard issue for Adeptus Arbites capture-units across the Calixis Sector and also carried in the armouries of the better equipped local law enforcement units, such as the Magistratum of Scintilla, the weapon takes the form of a heavy, wide-barrelled projector fed from a large canister worn on the user's back. The weapon's use is often reserved for when large numbers of targets are to be taken alive for interrogation or where important bystanders are caught in the line of fire.

#### **Belasco Galvian Needler**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Galvian)

Another Belasco Deathworks weapon of dubious provenance, this advanced and elegant needle pistol is designed for close-range work. The pistol also has the dubious distinction of being the weapon used for the infamous murder of Cardinal Tyndale and a dozen other deacons and priests at the famed "sorrowful matins" massacre on Gallowglass, the deliberate infection of the lauded High Lady Alatia of House Krin with Mori immedicabalis, and numerous other high profile killings over the years. This has lead to the House of Belasco being denounced from the cathedral pulpit as "sinful deathmongers" on several occasions, a claim the Belasco family have not deigned to refute.

For an additional 300 Thrones, a modified Galvian can be bought fitted on a special hidden rig that is worn on the user's forearm, fired by means of a special palm trigger. This version has the Concealable attribute.

**Needler**

#### **The Belasco Deathworks**

The manufactora of the powerful House of Belasco on Malfi mass-produce standard pattern small arms and energy cells to feed the Malfian sub's planetary defence forces and numerous petty sub-sector war zones. Their elite arm, the grimly named Belasco Deathworks, is said to have begun its existence as the armourer to the House's own frighteningly large assassin cadre. They produce a considerable number of speciality arms, such as sniper weapons, compact pistols, bespoke toxins, implant weapons and other murderous devices. Thanks to Malfi's thriving culture of vendetta, the Belasco have no shortage of local buyers for their wares and, additionally, many of the Deathworks's products are also "sold on" further afield through House Belasco's long standing links to the Machenko Dynasty and their trans-sector trade network.

#### **Artifico-Biologis, 0.5 I Hypo Pistol**

**Class:** Exotic (Hypo Pistol)

This compact and intricate handgun, crafted from clockwork and brass, is a Cult Mechanicus device used by the Magos Biologis and their agents to subdue living specimens. By the use of a cunningly fashioned mechanical spring, it fires a short-range injector dart fitted with a penetrating filament that delivers a chemical payload directly into the target's bloodstream. Nominally a tool for the Biologis or Medicae, it is actually quite commonly found in the hands of bounty hunters, criminal scum or even enforcers who want to take their prey alive. The weapon has its most sinister reputation on the hive world of Solomon, where an often-purged and darkly fabled cult known as the "sleepers" have been using these devices to abduct victims for so long that they and their predations have become a tale to frighten children.

Flamers

The usual payload for a hypo pistol is strixis tincture, a powerful soporific, although, almost any chemical, toxin or even viral agent could be used. When filled with the strixis tincture, any living target damaged by the weapon must pass a Hard (–20) Toughness Test or fall comatose for 1d10 × 3 minutes. On a failure by three or more degrees, the target is comatose for 1d5 hours instead.

Injector darts are designed not to unduly harm their targets. Roll for Damage as normal to overcome the target's Toughness Bonus and Armour Points. Any Damage in excess is reduced to 1 point.

Hypo-pistol ammo is Scarce and each hypo-dart has a base cost of 8 Thrones each.

# IV: Hive & Forge Worlds

#### **Cadence "Widower" Dart Caster Device**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Widower)

A weapon of assassination that grew out of the bitter guild vendettas in Hive Magnagorsk on Fenksworld, the Widower is another unique design created by the mysterious artisan cult known as Cadence and is now perhaps their most widely known creation. Using a much more powerful version of the magnetic/las impellor found in Imperial needle weapons, the caster fires not a crystalline poison sliver, but an armour-piercing adamantine dart, fractal edged and designed to penetrate light body armour with ease. The darts are subsonic, their passage sounding only a slight hum as they speed through the air, and the weapon itself makes no flash whatsoever when fired, making it an excellent killer from the shadows.

The profile listed here assumes a standard razor-dart, although poisoned or explosive darts are not unknown. Cadence supplies the weapon with an attachable frame-stock and a long-barrelled impellor that turns it into a two-handed Basic type weapon with a base range of 150m and a weight of 4.5 kg (although its Damage, etc., remains the same.)

Razor darts are also Rare items with a base cost of 15 Thrones each.

#### **Flamers Cadence Promethium "Destroyer" Incineration Device** Flamers

#### **Class:** Pistol (Flame)

A weapon produced only to order by special commission by the artisan-masters of Cadence, the Destroyer is a highly advanced pattern of hand flamer that uses force-compression technology similar to that of a plasma weapon to create a superheated thermal-incandescent blast that burns far hotter and with greater fuel efficiency than that of a usual flamer. If the stories are to be believed, the first commissioner of this weapon was none other than the legendary Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Ark-Ashten, although this is likely to be apocryphal.

#### **Cadence Arms and Incunabula**

Although nominally a commercial enterprise, many would label Cadence as some form of secret society or even heretical tech-cult, whose services may be bought by the highest bidder. Based in the rarefied halls of Nova Castillia on Fenksworld, Cadence is also known to have offices and agents in dozens of hives and chartist vessels. Cadence offers weapons, servitors and other arcane devices of the highest order and sophistication to its private clientele (among which elements of the Holy Inquisition are whispered to number) and it is said they are able to fashion any device a buyer might desire for the right price. Certainly, many of their creations seem to "skirt the edge" of techno-heresy. Just why the Cult Mechanicus hasn't clamped down on them remains something of a mystery, and the tech-priest authorities remain curiously and firmly silent on the matter.

#### **Gas Torch Flamer**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

The "torch" or "gas-lighter", as most call it, is not strictly a weapon but an industrial tool that uses incandescent vapour to burn debris and clear the fungal growths that plague many hive duct-systems. The "gas-lighter" also serves well enough as a flamer for many low-rent hive gangs who can't afford the real thing and is frequently found in the hands of insurrectionists. The "torch" is nowhere near as effective (or stable) as a true flamer, but it is easy to procure and the wash of burning gas can still crisp flesh to cinders.

Gas torches use bulky, ill-protected canisters to carry their fuel. If an individual carrying a gas torch flamer suffers a Wounding hit to the body from the rear, there is a 50% chance that the canisters explode—treat this as a four metre blast, causing 2d10 E Damage, the wearer suffering double rolled Damage and catching fire.

#### **Tox Spray**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

The tox spray is a terrifying weapon found in the hands of the worst kind of gang scum in the most polluted hive sumps. The weapon uses an unholy mixture of highly corrosive industrial residue and toxic waste contained under high pressure, unleashed through a jury-rigged spray gun. The effects of the mixture on flesh are truly horrific and all but the best armour is little protection from the burning poison. Notoriously, the tox spray is used by the gangers of Hive Volg on Fenksworld to execute traitors and informants in the most gruesome manner possible—and without doubt there are few worse ways to die.

If the tox spray suffers a Jam (on a roll of 94–00), the weapon ruptures explosively, inflicting the weapon's damage as a two metre blast with double rolled Damage to the user.

#### **Las Weapons Civitas Pattern Laspistol** Las Weapons

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

A simple utility weapon, the Civitas is another model whose origins date back far into Imperial history. The Civitas is both somewhat bulky and inefficient (owing to lower quality components than a military-grade laspistol), but remains popular due to its ease of manufacture, longevity and simplicity of maintenance. These pistols are made on almost every major hive world for planetary defence armouries and civilian hands. Millions of these pistols are in circulation, from a simple polysteel and resin model an underhive declamator might own in hopes of defending his wares in the Tranch warrens, to a family heirloom furnished in hand-carved night corral and worn with pride by one of the sailwrights on the edgeworld of St Astrid's Fall.

#### **Sollex Pattern-IX "Death Light"**

#### **Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Made to the requirements of the Magnagorsk guilds by the Mechanicus sect of Sollex, the Death Light is an extremely powerful compact lasgun with a folding stock designed to fire high-energy blasts. These blasts, considerably stronger than a normal lasgun discharge, can easily burn through the thick insulation suits worn throughout Magnagorsk hive. Their power hungry nature, however, means Sollex guns are far less efficient than most las weapons and dangerous if overcharged.

Sollex weapons use standard power packs. However, owing to their more powerful charge they get commensurately fewer shots from them. It is possible to hotshot or overcharge Sollex weapons but it is dangerous. If this is done, they become subject to the Overheats rule. Sollex weapons have Scarce Availability in Magnogorsk and are Very Rare elsewhere.

#### **Drusus Prime Pattern Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Made in large numbers for Calixis PDF use, the Drusus Prime is in fact a local copy of the ubiquitous Ryza-M pattern lasgun made by numerous forges and manufactorums. All weapons of this type made in the Calixis Sector are named in honour of the warrior saint and bear a crude stamp of his profile on their casing. A simple charge repeater lasgun, the Drusus Prime is perhaps the most widely produced long arm in the sector, and the sheer numbers stolen from armouries and legitimately traded over the centuries make it the most likely of its type to be found in the hands of gangers, criminals and low-grade guns for hire from Scintilla to Baraspine.

#### **Khayer-Addin Duelling Las**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

A masterwork of the gunsmith's art, these weapons are handcrafted to the highest quality by the Khayer-Addin and designed around the "single shot kill", using a unique charge cartridge which is, in essence, a pre-loaded hot-shot pack. This single powerful blast is particularly effective against armoured targets and belies the pistol's elegant appearance. The duelling las holds a special reverence and place in folklore in Gunmetal City where they are known as "Valentines" in local parlance, named for a near mythical gunslinger from Metallacian history. Conversely, in some of the more rarefied climes where duelling with pistols remains popular, such as the high spires of Sibellus, some consider this class of weapon's power "unsporting" and so lethal as to take all the skill out of things (particularly if you wish to wound or maim).

The Valentine uses special single-shot cells rather than standard power packs; these cells are Rare items with a base cost of 20 Thrones each. The Valentine cannot be combined with an overcharge pack or an additional hot-shot charge.

#### **Minerva-Aegis Las Carbine**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Popular with the more notable mercenary companies and private guild armsmen, the Minerva-Aegis is a sophisticated las carbine that unusually features a high cycle-charge chamber allowing it a rapid pulse mode comparable to fully automatic fire. Fruit of the Aegis Fragment and currently produced under title to the Takara Fane of Gunmetal, the high-grade materials needed for its construction mean its cost is significantly more than more commonplace lasguns. It is an undoubted sign of discerning professionalism in a hired scummer (or aptitude in stealing from their betters), for them to be wielding a Minerva-Aegis.

#### **Takara Palatine Compact Laspistol**

Launchers

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

A superior weapon, thanks to its advanced manufacture, the Palatine loses no stopping power despite being half the size of most military model laspistols. The Palatine has been produced exclusively for the last century by the Takara Fane of Gunmetal. As popular with the Scintillan nobility as it is with hardened mercenaries, the pistol is carried mostly for personal protection (by those that can afford it), and many of the noble scions that own one seek to further embellish their weapons with intricate lacquer work and inlays of precious metals to distinguish their weapons from those of "mere tradesmen", a service the Takara also provide for the right fee.

#### **Belasco Series-S "Venom" Compact**

#### **Laspistol**

**Class:** Pistol (Las)

An unusual pattern and one befitting the treacherous reputation of its origin world, Malfi. The Venom is a highly compact laspistol designed for covert use. It takes the shape of a flat disk

that is grasped in the hand, with the short barrel-emitter projecting between the middle fingers, fired by applying pressure to a hidden trigger. Eminently concealable, the Venom is an excellent tool for murder and espionage and widely favoured both on Malfi and beyond, although it is neither as expensive nor rare as its other local rival, the infamous Mariette pistol.

Owing to its unique design, the Venom does not use standard power packs. Instead its internal power cell must be recharged between uses (via a standard port).

#### **Sollex Pattern-VII "Steel Burner" Heavy Laspistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

Produced by the enigmatic Cult Mechanicus sect of Sollex, this hugely powerful pattern of laspistol (described by some as a "lashand cannon") has rapidly garnered a lethal reputation beyond its origins on Fenksworld where it's the chosen sidearm of the guild retainers of Magnagorsk. Although offered for small-scale trade on Fenksworld, Sollex weapons are almost impossible to obtain otherwise despite the efforts of many including Belasco, Skaelen-Har and Takara to duplicate the weapon—all have failed.

Sollex weapons use standard power packs. However, owing to their more powerful charge, they get commensurately fewer shots from them. It is possible to hotshot or overcharge Sollex weapons but dangerous. If this is done they become subject to the Overheats rule. Sollex weapons have Scarce Availability in Magnogorsk and are Very Rare elsewhere.

#### **Launchers** Launchers

#### **Gorge Pattern Grenade Launcher**

#### **Class:** Basic (Launcher)

The Gorge is a simply made, single shot break-open grenade launcher. Its simplicity does not diminish its effectiveness, though, and it is also relatively compact and very reliable, facts that make it one of the most widely used squad support weapons carried by enforcers, mercenaries and PDF troopers. Thanks to its widespread availability on the black market, the Gorge is also one of the most common ways for recidivists and rebel groups to obtain weapons for insurgencies and attacks.

#### **Melta Weapons Melta Cutter** Melta Weapons

#### **Class:** Basic (Melta)

Used to cut and weld sheet metal in macro construction facilities, the melta cutter is extremely large and cumbersome and not designed as a weapon, but it takes little imagination to turn this piece of industrial equipment into an unwieldy but highly effective killer. The melta beam produced by the cutter is of a very short range but can quickly breach most sealed bulkheads and reduce a fully armoured Arbitrator to hot gas and ash with ease.

The melta cutter has a maximum range of 10 metres. It also receives no bonus to hit for firing at closer ranges than this. Melta cutters require a Strength Bonus of 4 or more to be used effectively as a weapon. Weaker characters suffer a –10 WS penalty for each point of Strength Bonus below 4.

#### **Primitive Weapons** Primitive Weapons

#### **Drive Nailer**

#### C**lass:** Basic (Primitive)

One of the first weapons to appear in the hands of heretics in a hive uprising, the drive nailer is simply a high-power nail or rivetdriving gun of the type common to the millions who toil in hive construction and reclamation crews across the Imperium. With its power setting turned up to maximum and its safety features disabled, the drive nailer can make a messy but effective weapon.

#### **Impaler**

**Class:** Heavy (Primitive)

Carried by the most slab-muscled of gang heavies and other degenerate scum, Impalers (also known as the "harpoon cannon"), as primitive as they are, can still launch a spear of metal capable of punching straight through a human body with ease. Usually made by desperate and ill-equipped hive or mutant gangs from discarded industrial springs and hightensile cable, the harpoons used are often little more than a length of metal piping with its tip ground to a wicked point. Up-hive gunslingers and enforcers may scoff at the crudity of these weapons but sometimes find that it is much harder to laugh when pinned to a wall by a metre-long spear.

A Strength Bonus of at least 4 is required to operate the mechanism to reload an Impaler.

#### **Scrap Cannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (Primitive)

For underhive gangs who cannot steal or buy more effective heavy armament, the best they can bring to a turf war is a scrap cannon. Made from a crudely reinforced length of pipe packed with black powder and rammed with nails, bolts and anything else nasty scraped from the underhive floor. Scrap cannons are hugely unwieldy and not actually very lethal. However, they look scary and make an impressively enormous bang and pyrotechnic blast when fired, added to which the ammo is more or less free!

Individuals successfully hit with a scrap cannon must Test for Pinning. Scrap cannon are Very Rare items outside of the Underhive, and have Average availability in their depths.

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **.54 Tranter Hand Cannon**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

These massive gas-operated stub automatics, sometimes mockingly referred to as a "poor man's bolter", are undoubtedly powerful but often plagued with mechanical problems and notoriously prone to jamming. This does little to alter their appeal, though, with those who like their weapons hugely menacing and capable of taking a man's head clean off in one shot. Underhive and heretek workshops, from the bowels of Infernis to the rookeries of Solomon, produce Tranter knock-offs for eager buyers, while the Belasco Deathworks production models are actually little better in terms of reliability.

Owing to their sheer ungainly size and recoil, as well as being classed as a hand cannon, unless the firer has a Strength Bonus of 4 or more, the Tranter counts as a Basic weapon and must be used with two hands. The weapon Jams on a roll of 94–00.

#### **Armageddon Pattern Autogun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

First imported to the hive factories of Calixis to supply loyalist forces in the Tranch insurrection and the massive wave of mutant uprisings in Tranch's Soot Warrens that followed, the Armageddon pattern proved itself both in the Tranch conflict and the decade of petty cult-inspired civil wars that plagued the Malfian sub in the following years. Still manufactured primarily on Malfi itself, the Armageddon is loud, lethal and uncomplicated; a heavy-hitter for an autogun, it fires large calibre solid slugs from a fifteen-round short box clip and can stand a phenomenal amount of abuse and keep firing. Since the uprisings, the Armageddon has become a staple of the arms trade in the Malfian sub and has started to make inroads into frontier areas where its stopping power and robust design rapidly gains converts.

#### **Hax-Orthlack Armsman-10 Pattern Service Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

This bulky and intimidating high-capacity stub pistol is a common sidearm for enforcers, household troops and mercenaries throughout the Calixis Sector. A copy of the traditional Scipio pattern Naval pistol, the Armsman has been mass-produced for centuries under contract to arm the Magistratum cadres of Scintilla and many other worlds. Most are manufactured with the sigil or cipher of the contracted buyer machine-stamped into their grips, and examples without such a mark (or "rogues" as they are known) are often considered unlucky by the superstitious.

#### **Scatheros "Blackhammer" Defence Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

Notorious for its sheer destructive power, the Blackhammer comprises of a carefully crafted barrel fitted to an equally well-crafted stock and firing mechanism, all constructed to safely fire a single massive shell, more than twice the size of a standard shotgun cartridge with many times the power. Each shell is custom-made and filled with dozens of heavy pellets the size of stubber rounds, backed by a huge charge; the quality of the barrel breach and stock are vital to keep the weapon from tearing itself apart with every firing. The Blackhammer itself is a rarity whose fame often precedes it. The weapon's short range and single-shot capacity are often overlooked in favour of its immense stopping power, although, like many such weapons, it can prove dramatically less effective against targets with substantial "hard" armour.

Such is the weapon's ferocious recoil it imposes an additional –10 to hit unless the firer has a Strength Bonus of 4 or more or the weapon is braced. The Blackhammer's shells count as Exotic ammunition.

#### **The Aegis Data Fragment**

A technological jewel and prize beyond price, the Aegis Data Fragment alone was, for the Adeptus Mechanicus, worth the millions that died during the Angevin Crusade. Discovered during the horrific Adranitian phase of the crusade, the technoarchaeological find, known as the "Aegis", contained templates for all manner of systems, as well as a treasure trove of other data and logos. The granted licenses for the use of the more mundane templates from Aegis helped form the basis for the fortunes of several famous houses and cartels, and their dispersal cemented the rights and properties of the Mechanicus within the fledgling power structures of the Calixis Sector. The Mechanicus has never revealed whether the Aegis Data Fragment yielded more than a few new small arms patterns, systems schematics and augur interfaces, or whether it posed further questions yet unanswered, or was merely a part of some larger undiscovered whole. It has not escaped the notice of the Ordos Calixis, though, that the Mechanicus maintains several secretive outposts bordering the Adrantis Nebula still, and it is thought that at least sixty-four known explorator expeditions have been sent into the untamed volumes of the nebula at the behest of the secretive priests of the Machine God.

#### **Westingkrup Carnodon Pattern Precision Hand Cannon**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

No mere blunt tool, the Carnodon is a finely made and well-balanced weapon, distinctly based on the internal mechanism and layout of an Imperial bolt pistol (which aside from its long barrel, it superficially resembles), it is both powerful and extremely accurate in skilled hands. A high priced and exclusive item, the ownership and ability to use a Carnodon is a mark of high status among the criminal gangs of Scintillan hives, and this superior weapon is also found in the armouries of the Adeptus Arbites and the elite Janissary Lifeguards of the powerful House Krin.

#### **Hax-Orthlack Creed-9 Autogun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

The Creed-9 is a compact autogun designed for closequarter warfare and constructed to a local variant of a long established design intended for Naval boarding troopers. Made using lightweight materials and fitted with a telescopic stock, the Creed-9 is not much larger than a military autopistol in size and is the favoured weapon for many enforcer kill squads, as well as the private armies of numerous noble houses and Chartist Captains. Because of this "elite" role, it's common to see Creeds sporting numerous upgrades and modifications such as red-dot sights, expanded mag-ports and fire selectors.

#### **Sulymann Encarmine Service**

#### **Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

A sophisticated autopistol no larger than the average compact stubber, the Encarmine sacrifices stopping power for a reduction in size and increase in clip capacity. Widely carried for personal defence and as a sidearm by "second liners" (such as plainclothes enforcers, hauler rig crews and merchants' factors), the Encarmine packs a lot of firepower into a relatively small frame. Unfortunately if faced with armoured opponents, the firer is likely to wish for something with a good deal more kick.

#### **Khayer-Addin Forge "Fate Bringer" Long Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

This elegant and perfectly balanced stub revolver is a prime example of the kind of pistol commonly used to "settle affairs of honour" among the nobles of Sibellus and their off-world imitators. Deceptively simple in design and exquisitely well-made from the finest materials, the Fate Bringer is perfectly suited to its role as a duelling piece and also makes for a good target and assassination pistol, although its lack of clip capacity and slightly ungainly size make it a poor choice for real combat in the eyes of some.

#### **Fykos Forge "Flametongue" Howdah Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

The Fykos Forge of Gunmetal is a prestigious clan of master gunsmiths who specialise in elaborate and finely made hunting weapons, and the Flametongue is no different. This simple and reliable weapon is a compact twin-barrelled hand cannon, chambered to fire huge, custom-made soft alloy rounds that break apart on impact to cause horrific wounds. Intended as a powerful last line of defence should a hunter be ambushed or have the tables turned on him, anything that can't be put down with the Flametongue's twin shots you probably shouldn't have been hunting anyway.

Flametongue rounds count as Exotic ammunition with the Primitive quality.

#### **Hack Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Known by a wide variety of nicknames on different worlds, this is a conventional double-barrel shotgun, cut down to the smallest possible size and rigged to fire both of its barrels at once from a single trigger pull. Although very short-ranged and hardly a precision weapon, the twin blast is still devastating against "soft targets" (such as unarmoured civilians), and the sight of one can have a very salutary effect on bystanders. A Hack is no substitute for a true combat weapon though, as many a ganger faced with carapace-armoured enforcers has found to their cost.

Although it only fires a single blast, it uses two shotgun shells at once (if loaded with a single shell it only inflicts 1d10+4 Damage without the Tearing ability).

#### **Hecuter 9/5 Heavy Combat Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Often regarded with some justification as a "prince among pistols", the Hecuter manufactured by the Orthlack of Gunmetal is actually a copy of a famed out-sector design, whose pattern was awarded as part of some long-forgotten trade war. A firm favourite among Metallican gunslingers and Malfian bloodsworn, the weapon is tooled and balanced to exact tolerances, making it quite controllable despite its large calibre for an autopistol. The Hecuter's clip projects somewhat from the angled grip, giving the weapon a distinctive profile, while despite its size, its excellent design makes it an "easy carry" from shoulder rigs and quick-draw holsters.

**Hecutor 9/5 Heavy Combat Autopistol**

#### **Mariette Cylinder Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Named for the Malfian noble house said to have originated the design—or at least first championed its use within their assassin cadre, the Mariette is an extremely concealable compact stub pistol crafted from polyflex and ceramics with no metallic or powered components. Its four-chamber barrels are self-contained and the whole pistol is designed to easily break down into a handful of small parts. Disassembled, the Mariette can be easily concealed about the person or inside some innocuous object (such as a lamp or data-slate) with almost no chance of detection and be re-assembled to fire in mere seconds.

The Mariette when disassembled and hidden is virtually impossible to find (–30 penalty on Search Tests) as the parts don't show up on scanners or auspexes as weapons. The ammunition-barrel cylinders for the Mariette are themselves Rare items and cost a base price of 100 Thrones each.

#### **Volg "Meat Hammer" Scattergun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

While shotguns can make for brutally effective weapons, the gangers of Volg have created an even more savage variation to stamp their authority on those that dare to cross them. The "meat hammer" (so-named for its tendency to turn flesh into unrecognisable chunks), is a specially constructed, triple-barrelled, open choke shotgun that can all but destroy a living body with a single blast. Usually fired from point-blank range, a meat hammer hit is intended to kill, obliterate and to discourage others, and is a particularly loud and messy way to die.

Although the meat hammer has a clip of "1" listed, it actually takes three shotgun shells to load.

#### **Volg Mercy Killer**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

So named because it's a "mercy if it kills what you're aiming at", this weapon exemplifies any number of crude, often scratch-built handguns used by the desperate and oppressed across the realm of mankind. Fashioned from whatever materials are to hand, these single-shot stub pistols are wildly inaccurate and often as dangerous to the firer as the target. In Hive Volg however, the provision of Mercy Killers has gone somewhat further than enterprising criminals bodging up home-brewed pistols, and the "higher powers" of Fenksworld manufacture Mercy Killers en-masse as part of their drive to arm the Volgites as inexpensively as possible. Indeed, a Mercy Killer and a handful of bullets cost less in Volg than a trencher of parboiled murk fungus to eat and a demi-litre of recyk water to wash it down with.

If a Mercy Killer suffers a Jam result, roll 1d10. If the result is "9" the pistol explodes, inflicting its Damage on the firer and destroying the gun.

#### **Fykos Forge "Nomad" Hunting Instrument**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

Possibly the most famous weapon Gunmetal produces, the Nomad well deserves its superlative reputation. The designs for the instrument are said to be the work of Angevin's personal gunsmith, who in turn held them from an ancient line that could be traced back to ancient times on Holy Terra itself. Whatever the truth of that somewhat fanciful accolade, the Fane of Fykos makes only perhaps ten Nomads to commission every standard year, and each is in some way different and personalised to the purchaser, be it the grinding pattern of the trigger or the choice of material for the stock. Such perfect workmanship combined with the capability to empty a carnosaur's brainpan at two miles, they say, makes it worth every Throne.

#### **Phobos Stubber**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Found across the length and breadth of the Imperium and no doubt predating its founding in design, these cheap stub automatics are turned out locally in the tens of thousands by both the Fane of Doru in Gunmetal City and by the Belasco Deathworks on Malfi (where it is known as a "rake" in local parlance) and exported across the sector. This commonplace pistol can be found everywhere from the stalls of underhive scav-traders, to frontier mining camps and Administratum supply depots (where it goes by the nickname of the "Sigma-9", after the opening code-line of the relevant requisitioning forms needed for an adept to get hold of one).

#### **Arms and the Imperial Citizen**

The Imperium is a universally militarised culture, beset from without and within. Throughout its history, weapons and warfare, or at least the fear of conflict, is omnipresent for most. On many worlds the carrying of arms is an accepted part of life and, despite the efforts of some paranoid planetary governors, there are often too many weapons in circulation to enforce control. This is particularly the case on hive worlds as many are centres not only for arms production but also for the mass storage of weapons; a hive that cannot arm at least a core of its massive population in a crisis or invasion would be found wanting in the eyes of the High Lords of Terra, and its rulers soon replaced. In order to retain some measure of control, however, in most hives the powers-that-be impose heavy taxes on the legitimate sale of weapons and other arms among the public. This tends to have a polarizing effect—placing arms in the hands of the wealthy and a hard core of professionals (be they bodyguards, duellists, mercenaries and the like), and of course criminals and underhivers who resort to the thriving black market trade in weaponry simply to survive.

#### **Hax-Orthlack Puritan-14 Execution Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

The Puritan is a squat dual-barrelled autopistol with an integral single shotgun cartridge chamber. An ugly weapon whose appearance signals its brutal purpose very well, the Puritan is designed for use by covert kill-squads and produced in small quantities both for the Adeptus Arbites and the elite Magistratum "Crimson Sashes" of Sibellus, (although a few copies have found their way into the black market as well). The Puritan may fire either as an autopistol or as a shotgun, but not both at once. If used as a shotgun, it imposes a –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests if not used with two hands.

#### **The Fanes and Forges of Gunmetal**

Gunmetal City on Scintilla is justly the most famed, respected and commercially powerful provider of arms and munitions in the entire Calixis Sector. The city's industry and culture revolves around weapons at all levels and the city's lawless and violent reputation is largely the result of the fact that any man or woman's worth in Gunmetal is largely decided by whether they are wiling to defend what's theirs with blood and bullets.

Most of Gunmetal's famous weapons are produced and controlled under the auspices of loose manufacturing cartelcombines known as "fanes", with membership of these fanes crossing all social strata from the highest armsmaster to lowliest unskilled labourer, with only a rare few strong enough or desperate enough to court independence outside of them. Being part of a fane is elective rather than an accident of birth (although familial and local tradition do hold great sway), and a Metallican may shift their oath and their allegiance between fanes or even go independent, although these matters are never taken lightly. As well as being a territorial structure and a commercial power, the fane also has a spiritual and techno-arcane dimension, and each has, at its heart, a great temple of arms at the centre of which is the high altar on which the fane's master-archetypes and weapons of legend are laid in reliquaries exalting the power of the gun. The fanes paradoxically offer some small measure of stability and protection for their members, and at the same time drive much of the city's conflict with their rivalries and trade-wars. Some fanes even act as covert backers of the infamously savage and well-armed gangs and gun-clans of the Infernis—Gunmetal's notoriously deadly underhive.

There are scores of different fanes and smaller independent "forges" on Gunmetal, all vying for prestige, money and power in a shifting quagmire of loose alliances and bloody feuds. Here is a sampling:

**The Fane of Doru:** While possessing a great deal of money and resources, the fane of Doru garners little respect or influence among its peers. Regarded by the rest as "artless panel beaters and skulking cowards", Doru is seen as little more than a front for the Skaelen-Har Hegemony, and they face an uphill struggle to consolidate or expand their power in the hive, (they are continuously beset on all sides by backstabbing and petty indignities). In terms of arms, the Doru is largely limited to the mass-production of PDF patterns, generic spares and ammo.

**The Forge of Fykos:** Perhaps the most famous and wealthy of the Metallican independents, the Fykos dynasty has supplied the elite of the Calixis Sector with the most potent and exclusive of hunting weapons and arms for centuries. Many on Gunmetal regard them as dangerously arrogant and insufferably effete.

**The Forge of Khayer-Addin:** The family of Khayer-Addin are reputedly of fallen Rogue Trader stock and their family forge has provided master-gunsmiths for five generations. They specialise in one-off commissions, duelling pieces and a variety of artfully disguised guns and blades. To the Scintillan nobility, a Khayer-Addin weapon is a highly desirable item, often an exquisite and ornate work of art whose lethality is rarely exceeded.

**The Fane of Orthlack:** Allied to the ascendant power of House Hax of Sibellus, the Fane of Orthlack hold the ironclad contracts to arm the Scintillan Magistratum and the enforcer cadres of many other worlds. Old, powerful and influential, the Orthlack are among the most conservative of the great fanes and arguably the strongest.

**The Fane of Takara:** A rising power, the Takara are creators of superior las weapons of all types. They have strong Cult Mechanicus ties and recently fought off a takeover by the Fane of Doru, forcing a radical reassessment of their power and influence by others in the Metallican hierarchy.

**The Fane of Westingkrup:** A powerful and aggressive fane, and one with a long history of survival despite the odds, Westingkrup specialises in revolvers, hand cannon, shotguns and other "low tech/high-quality" arms with a just reputation for crafting robust, no-nonsense weapons. Westingkrup is also infamous for the number of regulators and gunslingers it routinely employs and its willingness to go to war over the slightest provocation.

#### **Volg "Ripper Clip" Autopistol Class:** Pistol (SP)

Known locally as the "zip gun" or "chopper", this bulky autopistol is purposely designed to be a cheap as possible to manufacture and maintain. Rather than caseless ammo, the Ripper Clip uses basic stub rounds and the weapon itself is made from industrial spares and crude pressed metal parts. A further eccentricity of its design is its loading mechanism, a vertical strip of bullets wrenched through the autopistol as it fires (a feature copied from a common rivet gun). This unusual arrangement creates a distinctively loud banging-rattle when used, often ending with a clatter as the spent strip hits the floor—unfortunately advertising that the user is out of ammo! Despite the gun's many shortcomings there's no shortage of buyers on Volg, where any extra firepower you can lay your hands on might keep your corpse from the meat-sumps just a little longer.

Ripper Clips have a Common Availability on Volg and are Scarce elsewhere.

#### **Sulymann Holdout "Salvation"**

#### **Auto**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

An extremely compact handgun, (small enough to fit comfortably in a waistcoat pocket or lady's purse), the Salvation is designed as a personal defence item for merchants, adepts and affluent citizens untrained in weapons as the pistol is entirely self-contained and very easy to use. Intended only for use in emergencies, the Salvation's internal magazine rounds cannot actually be reloaded without partly dismantling the pistol first, giving it a reputation as little more than a "disposable toy".

#### **Westingkrup Model 20 "Scalptaker" Stub Revolver**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

An enviable example of robust and utilitarian design, the Scalptaker is a fantastically reliable pistol, firing true after almost any amount of abuse and mistreatment. This fact is not lost on professional fighters, frightened hivers and frontier colonists alike, who often choose the Scalptaker as a backup sidearm over more powerful pistols for this very reason. However, in the depths of the Infernis on Gunmetal, where the Scalptaker is made, the average ganger seeks to carry almost anything else, as its ubiquity brands it a "hab-proles" gun in their eyes and an object of some quite unfounded derision.

#### **Westingkrup "Slayer" Pump**

#### **Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

The Slayer is a classically functional design from the Westingkrup Fane intended to be a back-up weapon for vehicle crews and PDF troopers, but is now common across Calixis. Endlessly copied with minor variants on the design and fittings to its compact, stockless frame, it is said that almost as many of these weapons make their way into the hands of deep-hive scum as are supplied to the Munitorium. One unusual variant of the Slayer, known in the local cant as the "Bonefinger", is crafted from heat-resistant ceramics and scrimshaw. These are used in the hunting of dangerous Scoldbats in the burning heat of the upper reaches of Hive Tarsus, where a standard weapon might warp and fail in the extreme conditions.

#### **Cadence "Spectre" Assault Device**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

One of the few widely known weapons produced by Cadence. Technically, the Spectre Assault Device is an autogun and chambered to standard caseless rounds. However, the Spectre is far more than a mere "standard" rifle. Featuring a tri-mag shot selection system, it not only has a huge capacity of fire, but the flexibility of freely switching between multiple loads. Beneath the blocky barrel-shroud, the Spectre also mounts an integral shotgun unit giving the user even more options for dealing death and a hidden heavy punch. The weapon still has its detractors who consider it a "poor cousin" in comparison to the raw firepower of a bolter or hellgun.

The Spectre may fire either as an autogun or shotgun, but not both during the same Action. The Spectre has three magazines and has a fire selector.

#### **Steadholder Lever Gun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

Made in millions by the Fane of Westingkrup (and copied by a dozen lesser sources), the Steadholder is a heavy calibre rifle, loaded by a simple and distinctive lever mechanism. The Steadholder may not be the finest or most famed weapon to come from the forges of Gunmetal, but it is all that stands between starvation and an unpleasant death on the margins of many a world and justly respected for that. Although mainly intended for frontier settlements and agri-worlds, many Steadholders spill onto the black markets of the worlds where they are manufactured, ending up in the hands of gangs and low-rent hired guns. Considerable numbers have found their way into the hands of Redemptionists where the gun's ease of use and low cost make it suitable for fresh and untrained converts to the cause. These so called "saviour guns", often rippling with prayer parchments and votive tokens, have sent many a soul unwillingly to the Emperor.

#### **Stormchild Hand Cannon**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Another venerable and proven design, the Stormchild is essentially a scaled-up stub revolver with a hinged breach and a five shot cylinder. A heavyweight by any standards, the Stormchild is fully capable of demolishing armoured targets and a well-placed shot from one can even cripple civilian vehicles. What's more, the weapon is huge, loud and intimidating to boot. No wonder the Stormchild finds a particular home in the hands of many gang heavies, bounty hunters and hired guns. The Stormchild and numerous near identical weapons, such as the "Saint Varnae's Wrath" boarding pistol and the Scatheros-16 "Blackheart", are produced sectorwide from a variety of forges and makers. The Stormchild's size, weight and robust construction allows it to be used as a club in close combat without damaging the weapon.

#### **The Nightmare Hives of Fenksworld**

To most outsiders, Fenksworld has a reputation as a grimy, roughshod place, a hive world that, while notoriously independent in sector politics, is seen as lacking the significance or sheer size of the likes of Scintilla or Malfi. The truth of the matter is that Fenksworld's independence and measure of self-sufficiency is bought at a price, and its bustling façade hides a number of dark secrets.

The Fenksworld that most outsiders see is Nova Castillia—a vast towering edifice of sky-piercing spires and busy supply depots, noble enclaves, covered hab-stacks and bustling neon-lit entertainment 'burgs. Although a little ramshackle and dirty, it is not unlike many other hives across the Imperium. While Castillia houses much the planet's famously mercurial ruling elite and the bulk of the planet's population, what is not widely realised is that it also holds two subordinate hives in a merciless grip to ensure this position, hives that most off-worlders, if they are fortunate, never see.

The first, Magnagorsk, sinks deep into Fenksworld's crust. Heavily industrialised, it is a hellish place of molten metal and volcanic fires, where warship armour is forged and poisonous ash fumes the air. The hive exists purely to serve the Battlefleet Calixis port anchorage in high orbit. The conditions are so harsh that a native of Gunmetal City or the Lathes might count themselves fortunate on seeing them. Magnagorsk is controlled by the fractious and pitiless foundry guilds. To them labour and metal are only coins of the realm, and one guild master would think nothing of sabotaging or murdering their rivals, or kidnapping entire work gangs to help meet their production quotas. Life is cheap in Magnagorsk, violence commonplace and death and maiming everyday hazards, but the helots that toil thanklessly there know that it could be worse; they could be exiled to Volg…

Rather than towering above or delving into the earth, Volg sprawls for hundreds of square kilometres like a vast cancer of corroded gantries and phosphor-lit domes that have spread over Fenksworld's acidic salt-fens. The sprawl itself is made up of vast moisture-traps, reprocessing plants, waste-biomass recycling reservoirs and the mad clusters of stilt-supported shantytowns that cling to them. The simple truth is without these facilities' output, famine, pollution and poisoned water would destroy Fenksworld in a few short years—the toil of millions is needed to keep billions more alive. Named by some as the vilest and most misbegotten place in the whole Calixis Sector, the toxicity and terrible conditions in Volg are on the very limit of human survivability. Matters are made worse by Fenksworld's many unutterably lethal and horribly mutated native creatures.

Volg was initially set up as a vast open penal colony for Fenksworld and the surrounding sub-sector, and the inmates were left to found their own societies and to make what they could of their lives—so long as clean water and protein flowed up-hive to where it was needed. Control was further maintained through the trade in cheap arms and vital supplies, and it transpired that Volg's population was mostly too occupied trying to survive to attempt escape or plot revolt. Over the centuries Volg, to the surprise of many, prospered and became a hive in its own right with a population in the tens of millions. While new inmates (or "clean meat" as they are known in local parlance) are sentenced to exile there still, the majority of its inhabitants are now freeborn, some "six generations in the Volg" and free to leave—if they can afford the exorbitant passage out. Life in Volg is violent, anarchic, blighted and often very brief, but as for the Volgites themselves, they are born survivors. Few death worlds breed hardier or more ruthless fighters.

#### **Talon Mark III Short Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Another common Imperial pattern, manufactured to a high standard by the Fane of Sulymann in Gunmetal (along with several other makers), the Talon is a medium calibre, fullyautomatic caseless cartridge pistol of a sturdy and practical design. Easily maintained, capable of laying down a hail of fire and handy enough to be easily used in confined spaces, autopistols such as the Talon are very popular for hive warfare and used extensively by enforcers and scum alike.

Like most military autopistols, the Talon may also use an extended 30 round clip, but if this is the case, it may not be holstered and must be fired two-handed or the weapon imposes a further –10 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests.

#### **Volg VI "Crank Cannon" Heavy Stubber**

**Class:** Heavy (SP) The Volg VI has one simple virtue—its ease of manufacture. The "Crank Cannon" uses cheaply prefabricated parts and standard heavy stubber ammo. Its firing mechanism is purely hand-powered, the firer literally cranking the firing handle to grind the ammo belts through the breach and rotate the weapon's quad barrels. Originally produced as an inexpensive and

mechanically simple weapon to defend against Hive Volg's many treacherous forms of wildlife, the "Big-Six", as it is also known, has proved to be a great success despite its drawbacks. The weapon is produced in huge numbers on Fenksworld and exported to cheaply supply low-grade PDF forces and the private arms market across the sector. A real brute to use, especially for long periods, it's unsurprising that "Crank" gunners are often marked by massively overdeveloped right arms.

#### **Grenades** Grenades

#### **Choke Gas**

A particularly indiscriminate and potentially lethal weapon designed for crowd control and riot dispersal, choke gas contains a powerful irritant that attacks the eyes and respiratory system. A few lungfulls of the thick bluish gas can reduce the most ardent of mobs to a sobbing, coughing morass. Despite its undoubted effectiveness, choke gas is not a weapon of first choice for the Adeptus Arbites and is usually relegated to heavy raids or serious civil crackdowns, as it has a tendency to spread through the air filtration systems common to many hives, and is powerful enough to kill or seriously harm those of weak constitution.

Each Turn that a character is caught in the blast radius of choke gas, they must Test Toughness. A failed Test indicates the victim gains a level of Fatigue (multiple Rounds are cumulative). The harmful effects of choke gas last while the character is in the blast area plus 1d10 Rounds. If a victim of choke gas fails the Test by four or more degrees, they also reduce their Toughness Characteristic by 1d10 for 1d5–1 hours. Choke gas clouds linger for 1d5 × 3 minutes. Choke gas comes in the form of canister grenades and as launcher rounds.

#### **Nail Bomb**

The confines and dense crowds of a hive make weapons such as frag grenades perfectly suited to sowing terror and destruction there. For this reason anti-personnel devices are usually heavily proscribed, but that doesn't stop the more inventive criminal scum from fashioning their own. The nail bomb presented here is an explosive charge packed around with rusted nails, metal spoil, crushed glass and other assorted nastiness, all packed into a convenient length of pipe or an old food canister and fitted with a home-made fuse that hopefully is reliable enough not to kill the user.

#### **Riot, Revolt and Calamity**

That any civilisation is "three missed meals away from anarchy" is an adage that has held true since long before the Imperium and applies doubly in the case of a hive world. In any given hive, millions must live together in jostling proximity, utterly dependant on a complex and gargantuan infrastructure for the mere basics of daily life such as food, power, light and even clean air. If widespread rioting, unrest or serious disorder is allowed to ferment it is possible that the threads binding the hive together may be broken—and millions may suffer as a result. It is said by some that this is one reason why the phenomena of the "underhive" is allowed to exist in some form or another on most hive worlds, as a vital sinkhole for the city's malice, sin and discord.

Despite unceasing vigilance and totalitarian control, catastrophic unrest does sometimes occur in even the most tightly ordered of hives, and the history of the Calixis Sector is littered with such calamities: Fenksworld's infamous Tyburn food-tax riots saw Volg's population almost double inside a year (before natural attrition reduced it again in the following few months), while the two-decade long period of petty revolts and near civil anarchy caused by the misrule of House Koba on Malfi left near a billion dead and saw the final ruination of what had been one of the most powerful noble families in the sector. In more recent times even the mighty and prosperous Hive Sibellus has not proved to be immune. When heavy-handed Magistratum tactics stirred up a hornet's nest of trouble during what came to be known as the "Reinholt Blackouts", open warfare broke out between the Magistratum and criminal gangs, spilling over from the slums and no-go zones into the hive's infrastructure. Power was cut to several dozen middle-hive districts for days—fear and anarchy took hold and tens of thousands died, with whole regions gutted by raging fires. Many sections of the hive, damaged by the blackouts, remain as burnt-out ruins, collapsing into the underhive; they are now the haunt of dregs and worse. Also as a consequence of the rioting and thanks to their loss of face and perceived failure, the Sibellus Magistratum has become even more brutal in the execution of their duties.

# <span id="page-123-0"></span>Melee Weapons Me lee Weapons

*"Life's mysteries are all but ripples in the steel."*

— Landrian proverb.

The many and varied ranged weapons employed on hive worlds are matched by the hand weapons used by their populations. The tight confines and cramped quarters often mean that a hand-held weapon is preferred. Selections included here include Primitive, Chain and Power weapons. T

#### **Bolo Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Owing its origins to the time long ago when the hive world of Malfi was once largely covered in dense jungle, the bolo is a heavy single-edged cutting tool that for centuries has doubled as a brutally effective weapon. Crafted from mono-serrated plexsteel, the average bolo has a distinctive 40 centimetre long, inwardly curving blade that widens somewhat before the tip. This shape makes the bolo perfect for heavy slashing blows and, in skilled hands, it can lop-off limbs or open-up a man gut to gullet in a single stroke. Still used on Malfi as an everyday tool, it retains a murderous reputation and a favoured place in local folklore. The bolo is also favoured as a gang weapon among Malfi's jacker-gangs and dacoits, who traditionally mark noteworthy kills and exploits by acid-etching their blades with crude murder-glyphs known as "gris".

The weapon has Common Availability on Malfi and is Rare elsewhere.

#### **Chain Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Chain)

The chain knife works on the same principle as its larger kin: the chain sword. It often appears similar to a short cleaver or wide dirk, with a squat and murderous look to it. Powered by a compact cell in the hilt, the weapon's buzzing teeth rip through flesh with ease and splatter onlookers with hot gore. Chain knives, also known variously as "buzz blades" and "chain rippers", are almost entirely a hive-bound weapon and common from the infamous shredder gangs of the Sibellian underhive to the fighting cages of Malfi. On Landunder, the buzz blade is famously the province of the labour gangs that control the docking airlocks of the eight cities, notorious as they are for quelling dissent with a single ragged cut to the belly, the art of which is to leave the victim screaming as long as possible before death.

#### **"Devil's Kiss" Landrian Stiletto**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The Devil's Kiss is a long narrow blade that is quenched in blood during forging and sharpened only along the last five centimetres, leading to the needle-like tip. In the cities of Landunder, the Devil's Kiss is also the name of a blade clan notorious for quiet and subtle killing, their victims bleeding out from a single, almost invisible, puncture wound. It is said that unless you are learning the fatal tricks of the clan, you will never see this deadly blade except with your own blood wetting it.

#### **"Emperor's Whisper" Landrian Blade**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The Emperor's Whisper is the blade carried by members of the powerful Tithe Guild—the powerbrokers of the eightfold cities. Crafted from ceramics and unique alloys, the result they say is "as sharp as sin". Each is a deadly work of art, capable of slicing a hand off with a single blow and punching easily through light armour. On Landunder, the Whisper blade is more than simply a weapon; it is a badge of office and a sign of great status. To be gifted with a Whisper blade, if you are not of the Landrian Tithe Guild, is viewed as an incredible honour.

#### **The Blades of Landunder**

The crust of Landunder floats on a toxic chemical sea, shifting over the planet's surface at the whim of the undersea's deep tides. On the underside of that crust cling eight great cities, their armoured shells covered by intake vents, portals and docking bays like ancient organic growths. By ancient accord, no citizen of Landunder is permitted to carry a firearm because of the danger they pose to the structure of the city itself. Over the generations, the use of blades has become universal and this world has birthed some of the greatest knife-fighters in Calixian history. Their weapons (known to outsiders as "Landrian blades") have become so much a part of the culture of the world that the guilds, crews and gangs of the eightfold cities are each separated and distinguished by the blades they favour. Each has a highly developed art of wielding their chosen blade and, from the highest born satrap to the lowest chem-scummer, everyone who lives in Landunder does so with a knife less than a sudden gesture away. It is rare indeed for a Landrian child of either sex to pass to adulthood without at least one good scar (and usually more than that) to prove their honour. Tales of the Landrian blades and the skill of their wielders has spread throughout the Calixis Sector, and wealthy collectors on Scintilla often pay large sums for "blooded" blades of good provenance.

#### **Magistratum Chastisement "Punisher" Baton**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A byword for brutality on Scintilla, this heavy baton is not intended to incapacitate or capture but rather to smash limbs, crack skulls and wantonly crush any resistance with overwhelming force. The baton is a polymer sheathed, metre-long rod of strengthened plasteel with a hollow core part-filled with a dense liquid metal alloy to augment the force of blows struck with it. These weapons are widely carried by many enforcer cadres as a cheap and effective alternative to shock weapons, and many also find their way into "private" hands where they command equal fear.

#### **Render, Landrian**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Considered a cursed and ill-omened blade on Landunder for its dark history, the Render was created to take its victim apart slowly, piece by painful piece. A butcher-blade as long as man's forearm, its double cutting edges are covered with dozens of intricate serrations and hooks to maximise the victim's suffering and blood loss. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Render clan, nominally meat-mongers and tanners, have been repeatedly linked with murder cults and the worst criminal atrocities, and of all the Landrian clans they have the most sadistic and sinister reputation.

#### **The Khayer-Addin "Serpentine"**

#### **Power Blade**

**Class:** Melee (Power)

Although blade weapons concealed in walking canes, rods of office and even umbrellas are far from uncommon among the Calixis Sector's rich and powerful, few such weapons are as potent or as exclusive as the Serpentine. A thin rapier-like blade of the highest quality adamantine alloys and equipped with a miniaturised disruption field generator of great sophistication, it is a lightweight weapon and potentially devastating "surprise" for the unwary. Serpentines are custom made by commission and most take the form of elaborately carved walking sticks that disguise the weapon's nature until activated. Famously, the notorious duellist and libertine, the Marchioness Alyssa Marque, formerly of House Llahst, is said to have a Serpentine variant concealed in the form of an exquisite lady's fan that springs into lethal shape when triggered.

#### **Landrian "Sigilite" Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Named after a half-forgotten holy figure from a time long past, the Sigilite is a curious weapon wielded by the gelt-brokers of Landunder, (it is they who barter the price with crystal miners for the load yielded from the deepsea mineral chimneys). Traditionally a defensive weapon intended to protect the broker from robbery, the weapon is formed outlandishly from a set of intersecting steel crescents, sharpened along their edges, tapering-off to wicked points. The blade's curious shape, combined with the twirls and circling passes of the gelt brokers knife-work, allows it to deflect incoming blows before delivering savage raking counter-attacks.

# ARMOUR Armour

<span id="page-125-0"></span>*"To fail is to be flesh, only metal endures."* — On Mortality, Vol. XII-ΩΩ, Archmagos Paracelsus.

Most forms of armour, from primitive hides and scraps of metal to carapace armour worn by the PDF and military forces, can be found on nearly any hive world. The following armours are noted for originating from hive worlds in the Calixis Sector and include a new category of armour: Advanced Armour. M

Advanced Armour covers all forms of high-tech protective gear that does not fall into the four traditional types of Imperial armour: Mesh, Flak, Carapace or Power. This is usually because they are either developed for a special purpose or are made from rare materials that prohibit mass production. Advanced Armour has no special advantages or disadvantages.

**Hardened Body Glove**

#### **Hardened Body Glove**

Intended as a covert form of personal armour, the hardened body glove comprises a form-fitting suit made up of a flexible mesh fibre material that tenses when struck to disperse the impact. Additionally, the suit is also reinforced with a micro-scale insert of hardened ceramic lamellar plating over vital areas. Wearable under other loose or specially tailored clothing, hardened body gloves are a common choice for elite troops engaged in covert operations, bodyguards and anyone who wishes to protect themselves without an overt show of doing so.

For three times the listed cost, hardened body gloves can also be purchased with a sealable hood (covering the head) and inherent stealth features, making the wearer harder to detect with auspexes, IR vision and the like (imposing a –20 penalty on Tests to notice the wearer).

#### **Volcanis Shroud**

The shroud is the common name for an integrated suit of heavy protective gear including a temperature-insulating under-suit and a heavy, hooded blast coat of polymer and ceramite-alloy weave. The shroud takes it name from the vast magma-fed forges of Volcanis deep beneath the surface of Mars, and has long been a staple of heavy industrial hives and forge world gear, not least in Magnagorsk on Fenksworld where it is the universal garb of the foundry guilders, though it finds equal use in the industrial vaults of Gunmetal City and Ambulon.

The protection provided by the shroud is doubled against fire, acids and corrosives. Unfortunately, because of its substantial bulk, the shroud also imposes a –10 penalty on Agility Tests while worn. The suit also has a built-in rebreather and photo-visor.

#### **Mirker's Greaves**

These rather unusual forms of leg wear and boots are common in one form or another to the ill-fortuned (but often well-paid) men and women who are sent to hunt vermin and clear debris in the thousands upon thousands of kilometres of sewer and drainage systems that riddle a hive city. The blind, rancid things encountered in these sumps are usually more than capable of biting (or even burning) though most fabrics, and mirker's greaves are usually reinforced with polyflex and metal plate, and often razored or studded for good measure. Although used in nearly every hive city to some extent, they are unsurprisingly widespread daily wear on Volg.

The wearer can also kick with the same effect as if they were punching using knuckle dusters.

#### <span id="page-126-0"></span>**Hax-Orthlack MKII Magistratum Combat Carapace**

Produced by Hax-Orthlack for the Lord Governor's Magistratum enforcers, this suit of light articulated carapace is fully enclosed and features both a respirator and flash reactive eyepieces built into the helm. While most commonly encountered in the unforgiving grey-steel of the Scintilla Magistratum, Hax-Orthlack also produces this armour for the authorities of several other worlds in the sector, and a small number also find their way into the hands of the private retinues of powerful houses.

The suit of armour also has a built-in respirator, commbead and photo-visor.

> **Hax-Orthlack MKII Magistratum Combat Crapace**

*"We are doomed often to be caught unprepared by life. Personally I choose to insult fate by trying anyway…"*

— Olmen Zaryhk, gentlemen thief.

I n addition to arms and armour, the following items are particular to hive worlds, being used by indigenous populations to survive in the often harsh environment of the sprawling hives. I

#### **Axe-Rake**

A heavy multi-purpose tool, common to hive smelteries, foundries and work crews. The axe-rake is taken almost universally to symbolise labour and the manual workforce of the hive in the Calixis Sector. The axe-rake is frequently rendered as an icon both in industrial architecture and guild livery on most hive worlds. The genuine article can also make for a handy weapon in skilled hands.

The axe-rake grants a +10 bonus to Climb Tests, as well as on Tests made to force doors or locks open. It can also be used as a melee weapon, dealing 1d10+2 I or R Damage with the Primitive and Unbalanced qualities.

#### **Cognomen**

"Cognomen" is the official Administratum designation in the Calixis Sector for a hiver's identity card. In a hive, it is one of the only viable means of tracking, taxing and identifying the citizenry. Cognomen are usually blank iron-grey, punched-metal squares (about the size and shape of a playing card) and designed to be read by data-slates and cogitator systems. The only feature on the face of a Cognomen is the symbol of the issuing hive, guild or Adepta whom the citizen serves. In some ways, ownership of a cognomen is frighteningly important: it represents the only legal proof of identity, a right to work and even to be fed and housed for the average mid-hiver. Its loss might genuinely mean starvation, abandonment, arrest or even being cast down into the underhive in the blind face of Imperial bureaucracy. There is, of course, a thriving trade in the theft and falsification of cognomen, the price for a "face" varies on the identity fabricated or stolen, and can range from a few gelt to thousands.

#### **Forgery Kit**

This represents a catch-all category of tools and materials, from special parchment inks to task-dedicated codifiers intended to help the user forge or duplicate official documents, cognomen, passes and permits. Using this kit in conjunction with the relevant Skill (Trade (Copyist) or Tech-Use) grants a bonus to copy, forge or fabricate such items, depending on the quality of the materials involved and the difficulty of the task. The price shown is for a common quality kit that provides a +10 bonus. A Good Quality kit gives a +20 bonus, while a Best Quality kit provides a +30.

#### **Heretic's Wake Deck**

In the centuries since the sector's founding, the Ministorum has been unstinting in their efforts to stamp-out the game of "Heretic's Wake", but with little success. The game is played with a deck of cards made from a twisted and debased version of the Emperor's Tarot and to possess a set is a crime punishable by "having one's fingers dipped in molten gold"—for the blasphemy of holding such lies and creations of wickedness. The images on each card are rumoured to have been designed by the heretic illuminator, Cassilda, and it is said that if the cards are drawn in a certain pattern, the player will find themselves granted a vision of a far greater game, or perhaps simply go mad. The potential consequences have not prevented Heretics' Wake from spreading throughout the sector to the point where a game can be found in almost every dark recess.

#### **Holo Wafers**

Intended as fealty-badges, bargaining chips or signal-markers, holo wafers are small ceramic discs, each about as thick as a coin and no wider than a palm. Each is keyed to show a particular small holographic image when triggered. The devices have another, more sinister, use as so-called "death markers" or "kill claimers". Holo wafers displaying images such as a winking skull, a weeping mother or a burning tower are de rigueur items in the Scintillian underworld, serving as "calling cards" for many assassins, gunsells and contracted blades who leave them on the corpses of their victims to enhance their mystique and their reputation.

#### **Mantle-Shrine**

Common devotional items in the Calixis Sector, these small portable shrines take the form of a triptych wooden or flakboard box that can be closed into a case for carrying. Traditionally, mantle-shrines feature three hand-painted icons, the central being one of the aspects of the God-Emperor and at his right hand Saint Drusus, and at the left, an image or saint determined by the painter. The base unfolds to hold candles, an incense burner or a tack for votive papers. Most of these mantle-shrines are crafted in the pilgrim shantytowns of Hive Tarsus and exported by the Ecclesiarchy across the sector. One can find mantle-shrines even in the homes of the very poor on many worlds—indeed families often club together to buy them as wedding gifts. Many hive scummers, intent on robbery, also know that a locked mantle shrine is a favoured hiding place for many a poor stack-family's few coins, if they dare desecrate it.

#### **Ocular Catechizer**

A device favoured by ranking adepts, sages and Administratum officials, these arcane and intricate-looking eyepieces are designed to magnify objects and help identify and analyse visual patterns and data. They are somewhat temperamental instruments, requiring stillness and concentration to use; their machine-spirits are notoriously easily vexed, much to the pain of the operator.

| Ward Accessor                 | 25     | —      | Average               |  |  |  |  |

Using these devices gains a character a +10 bonus on Literacy, Lore and Search Tests where the close examination of objects, symbols and deciphering written text is involved. Other Actions cannot be attempted while using an ocular, and if a failure by four or more degrees is rolled on a Test involving the device, feedback through the eyepiece inflicts 1 level of Fatigue on the user. The eyepiece can also record its impressions to an attached data-slate for later study.

#### **Penthrift Dreadfuls**

The "penthrift dreadful" is a Calixian slang name for a small, cheaply printed pamphlet containing lurid stories of sordid murders, gang violence, fanciful tales of xenos atrocities and other strange occurrences, all couched in the form of morality tales or scaremongering religious tracts in order to evade censorship by the authorities. A popular, slightly licentious pleasure in the mid-hives, these publications are generally allowed to continue by the powers-that-be as they serve to reinforce the justly held fears and hatreds of the population, although, the Holy Ordos often keep a weather eye on their contents, just to ensure that no dangerous "truths" slip through amid the purple prose.

#### **Salvation Auger**

About the size of a pocket chrono, the salvation auger is designed to detect the presence of harmful radiation, airborne toxins and pollutants. These devices are common on most hive worlds, particularly for up-hivers venturing into the depths. Augers alert the wearer when danger is encountered, coming in a variety of patterns and makes, varying from ornate hololithic dials to utilitarian lapel-boxes that shriek alarms when triggered. Basic models do nothing more than signal danger, while the better models can be read with a Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test to determine the exact nature of the hazard.

#### **Volgite Gloom Eyes**

In the deepest regions of Volg, where light of any form rarely penetrates, the dripping, polluted waste occasionally forms strange amber-like deposits. Globular and glassy, these forms often glow with a strange luminescence that slowly changes and shifts in shade and colour. Rounded lumps, hacked from these deposits, are known as "gloom eyes" and are often carried bound into thongs around the necks of Volg gangers or mirk-stalkers as a form of charm. Though the light they shed is useful, the bearers of these curious objects believe that the eye's glow changes to warn them of danger. Whether true or not, you need any edge you can get if you live in Volg and the belief is widely held.

These items count as a superior charm (see page 146 in Dark Heresy) and they also shed light equivalent to that of a candle when uncovered. Characters from Volg that wear this charm gain a +10 bonus on Tests made to avoiding Pinning.

#### **Vox-Phonograph**

A domestic toy of the wealthy, phonographs are bulky table-piece devices of clockwork-cogs, switches, vox-grills, sounding horns and lens-projectors, built to play music or provide flickering holo-lantern shows. The usual fare for a vox-phonograph is orchestral symphonies, inspirational Ecclesiarchy sermons, issued guild reports and pict-slides, each recorded on a micro-etched metal cylinder which plugs into the machine's loom to be played. Better models (twice the listed price) may record cylinders of their own and play media from other sources such as data-slates. Sadly such entertainment is well beyond the price of the masses in most hives.

#### **Vox-Thief**

This complex device of the Omnissiah's arts is designed to pick up, store and analyse both vox and data transmissions in the surrounding area. They can either be used by an operator or can be covertly hidden to record in a particular area. Using a vox-thief 's basic functions requires a successful Difficult (–10) Tech-Use Test and may be made considerably harder by the nature of the task. Additionally, heavily encrypted signals need further analysis to break their code. Short-range vox-thieves are the size of a data-slate and have a range of about two to three kilometres, while long-range models are larger units, containing a powerful in-built cogitator and are comparable to military vox-casters in size (a large backpack), with a range of up to 50 kilometres. In both cases, this range can be reduced dramatically by local conditions.

#### **Ward Accessor**

Although often ritualised and little understood by most who use them, ward accessors are electronic passes that allow access to certain areas that are otherwise restricted. Such security measures are commonplace in hive cities where individual citizens and workers usually find certain places off-limits. Individual accessors vary widely in appearance, from simple cards to holo-coins, badges of office or even great seals, depending on just where the security is located and what is being guarded. The cost listed here is for a "blank" accessor (a potentially dubious but not illegal item) ready to be programmed with a code.

Drugs

#### **Hab Life**

For most hive citizens who spend their lives trudging from their hab-stacks and mid-hive tenement blocks to dreary and repetitive jobs in the manufactorum, the service-corps and work crews, life represents a somewhat bleak monotony against which they struggle to make something of their sparse conditions, raise families and hope never to suffer the attentions of the nameless horrors that they fear are lurking in the dark universe beyond. On most Imperial hive worlds (and those of Calixis are no different), what little mass media exists is rigidly controlled by the Ecclesiarchy and state for reasons of security and moral instruction. Rampant materialism, outside of the rarefied classes of the highborn and wealthy, is all but unknown. But even the most unimaginative hab-dweller needs some kind of diversion and entertainment to take their minds off their hardships and fears. While the Imperial Creed and the Ecclesiarchy provide great solace for many, the average hive-worlder likes their pleasures simple, direct and visceral—taverns, refectories, music halls and cook-shops offer the most commonplace daily escapes, while visits to holo-lantern shows, the carnivora or circus, or the greenery of a sealed arbour dome, are costly and rare excursions.

There are, of course, some for whom these diversions are not enough; they plunge past the bright lights of the entertainment 'bergs into the shadows that stretch all the way down to the dangerous sinks and stews of underhive. There they find darker forms of quasi-legal and outright forbidden escapes, including the blood sport pits, wager-halls and fighting arenas, pound bars and dust dens, and all manner of other vices offered by a seething criminal underclass—watched over by enforcers often either corrupt themselves, or more interested in maintaining order than the law. Worst still for those who seek such escapes, weakness, ill-fortune or fatal curiosity lead to far more forbidden fruit, whose cost is greater than mere life.

#### **Consumables Gorsk White Gyn** Consumables

Originating from the Fenksworld hive of Magnagorsk and distilled from modified engine coolant (hence its name), this caustic, icecloudy spirit is an extremely powerful brew and favoured by those with a taste for something with a bigger kick than even triplestilled amasec can provide. As well as making you feel as if your head has been staved in, Gorsk White, as a dilute measure, can also mitigate the effects of some tainted water and foods. Such "gyn mixes" are popular in the Metallican Infernis, the rookeries of Solomon and in the Soot Warrens of Tranch for this reason, though the Gorsk White remains the most infamous.

Drinking unmixed Gyn requires a Hard (–20) Carouse Test.

#### **The Wines of Quaddis**

Although amasec may be the most popular fine spirit across the sector, and many local ales and vintages hold sway where they are made, the most sought-after alcohol is the wine of Quaddis. The garden world of Quaddis is considered by most to be nothing more than a myth, or perhaps a place that once did exist but is now long gone to dust. Regardless, the wines produced by its viniculture are valued above all others and almost preternaturally potent. Many hive nobles and guilders pay huge sums for them and, in some cases, plot, murder and steal to attain them; seeing them both a mark of ultimate opulence and good taste. Three such wines are listed here: the first, the Sorrowful Vintage, is widely regarded as a pale imitation of the real thing (but still highly desirable), the second, the Golden Tokay, is perhaps the most accessible "true" Quaddis wine, while the last, the Kataline Malmsey, is the stuff dreams are made off—hugely valuable and, legend holds, capable of killing an over-indulgent drinker with pure pleasure.

#### **Drugs Night Dust** Drugs

The predatory Nightwings of Dusk produce a potent narcotic dust that they use to subdue their victims, lulling them into a nightmarish stupor, while the haemovoric Nightwing quickly sucks them dry. This substance, harvested from captured or slain creatures and rendered down into a concentrated form, is a powerful and prohibited drug. Usually burned as incense or, for a more powerful effect, dissolved in amasec, the dream-racked stupor that night dust induces can last for days, and the term "dusk dream" has long since become local parlance on Malfi for an unexpected disappearance or bout of madness.

A single dose imposes a –20 penalty on all Tests, while the imbiber experiences mild hallucinations and becomes disassociated from their emotions. After 2d10 minutes, the afflicted character slips into a deep feverish slumber filled with vivid and often violent dreams reflecting the darkest facets of their own mind. This state lasts for 1d10 hours and upon wakening the character must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points from the experience. Drinking the dust is far more potent and dangerous: the effects last 41d0 hours and the Willpower Test to avoid Insanity Points is Difficult (–10).

#### **Cults and the Lure of the Forbidden**

Cults find hive worlds their most fertile hunting grounds., and both the soulless drudgery of the mid-hive and brutalising criminality of the underhive make for easy converts, while many a powerful patron can be found among the jaded and dissolute of the hive's ruling elites. In a hive city, a cult can easily hide amidst the faceless masses of humanity, as hives are places where a dozen strangers or even a thousand can go easily unseen until their dark work bears fruit. In recent decades, both the hives of Fenksworld and Sibellus have suffered at the hands of two very different groups, the highly organised and resourced techno-heretics known as the Logicians, and the warp-worshipping nihilistic cult known as the Pilgrims of Hayte. Both have been responsible for thousands of deaths in dozens of plots and insurrections, and despite best efforts, neither one has ever been fully purged from the sector. Fenksworld has long become infamous as a proving ground for conspiracies that are later let loose on a larger stage, while Malfi—long a hotbed of intrigues and deceit—has proved especially vulnerable, with dozens, perhaps hundreds, of competing cults and sects suspected to be operating there at any one time. Indeed, as famously remarked by Lord Inquisitor Marr, "The only thing keeping Malfi from becoming a charnel house is nobody, not even the heretics, dare turn their backs on each other long enough to do the deed." For every conspiracy and heresy rooted out of a hive it is said that two more fester unseen, and the shadows cast by the tallest spires are dark indeed.

#### **Panimune**

This highly potent medicinal compound serves to greatly enhance resistance to most forms of toxins, contaminations, micro-parasites and infection for a period of hours after its application, although repeated use can cause physiological damage. Panimune is found in the med-kits of many enforcer squads, tech-priests and other parties wishing to descend into the underhive or travel through hazard zones.

The dose is usually applied by pressure-hypo directly to the neck and provides a +30 bonus on Toughness Tests made to resist toxins and diseases. As well, this bonus also applies to all Carouse Tests. The effects of a single dose lasts 1d5+1 hours.

After the dose expires, the subject becomes Fatigued until he rests. The subject may immediately re-dose himself (which also negates the Fatigue), but each time this is done without a period of 8 hours rest, he must pass a Toughness Test or take a –10 penalty on Strength and Toughness Tests for 1 hour and permanently reduce Willpower by 1d5.

#### **Slam**

Originating in the infamous Hive Volg on Fenksworld, slam is the worst kind of combat drug imaginable. Harvested from the chemical residue found in the intestinal tracts of the man-sized corpse roaches infesting the meat-sumps, it is first crystallised and then ground into a bile-yellow dust. Slam triggers a biological reaction, causing a massive boost in pain resistance and physical power. The user's muscles and veins visibly spasm and pulse under its influence. Though the effects are short-lived, it is highly sought after despite the long-term damage to the nervous system that even the smallest dose induces.

A character who consumes a dose of slam gains the benefits of the Unnatural Strength (× 2) and Unnatural Toughness (× 2) traits for 1d5 Rounds. Once the drug has run its course, a user permanently reduces their Strength and Agility Characteristics by 1d5.

#### **Somna**

An unusual and powerful drug to say the least, somna is a synthesised extract taken from the pollen of the Nephyis Orchid of Iocanthos. In its refined form, it is capable of producing a powerful coma-like effect in the subject, shutting down the metabolism and life processes, almost to the verge of death, and plunging the mind into a bottomless oblivion beyond the deepest sleep. The subject of somna appears to all but the most probing medical examination to be dead and can survive in this state for days or weeks without food or water and with almost no air. Aside from its medical uses, somna has been put to numerous nefarious purposes in the past from kidnapping, feigning death to evade capture and even as a particularly cruel murder weapon (with the victim waking up to find themselves buried alive.) In recent years, the more vicious narco-gangs of the Sibillan underhive have also used heavily adulterated somna to create "spiral black", a highly potent and extremely dangerous variant of obscura.

Services

Safely using somna, (the exact dosage must be calculated for each subject), requires a successful Difficult (–10) Medicae Test. A failed Test leads to unpredictable results, such that a failure by four degrees or more results in death. A successful Test places the subject into a deathlike trance for a period of time between one to ten days. The subject can be roused before this predetermined time by applying a stimm directly to the heart, but this is risky, and the subject must succeed on a Toughness Test or die from cardiac arrest.

#### **Verita**

The existence of verita is largely a secret and the Ordos Calixis are very happy to keep it that way. A powerful and singular hallucinogenic, once taken, the drinker's perceptions shift slowly to reveal the seeming interplay of distant realms, past, present and future; leading its addicts to claim that they can "see through time" to uncover unknown truths and witness incredible visions. Whether verita's gifts are mere illusions or a sudden immersive vision unfettered by the mortal perceptions of time, is a matter that remains unresolved, but its effects alone are enough to have the Ordos declare it a Moral Threat.

The substance's composition is unknown with many of its trace constituents completely defying analysis. When encountered, it usually takes the form of a viscous deep blue liquid, with a scent suggestive both of flower blossoms and subtle rot. Verita is a drug restricted by its rarity and cost to the very wealthy.

Consuming verita imposes a –10 penalty on Willpower Tests and a –20 penalty on Perception Tests for 3d10 minutes. While affected, the imbiber experiences visions and altered perceptions as determined by the GM. The user is always convinced of the truth of these visions and indeed, the contents of their "waking dream" can be valuable for overcoming some challenge or difficulty. Once the drug has run its course, the imbiber must succeed on a Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points. Those victims who gain at least 1 Insanity Point also have a 20% chance of gaining 1d5 Corruption Points as well.

#### **Services Luminum Tats** Services

Common particularly in Infernis and Tranch, but not unknown in Sibellus, lumimum tats (or "shine-jobs" as they are also known), are subdermal circuit and chemical tattoos that are essentially the "poor cousin" of the electoos crafted by the Cult Mechanicus. Displaying luminous and sometimes animate images, markings, slogans and gang-glyphs, they mark membership to one of the many underhive gangs, ward the superstitious from evil and brag about the deeds of the wearer. The more elaborate luminum tats are often the work of hereteks and some of the more radical tech-priests are known to favour their forcible removal from offending flesh, whether the wearer wishes it or not.

#### **The Pale Pits**

As with all else in Volg, entertainment is polluted and brutal. While most hives favour some form of blood sport pit or fighting arena, the "Pale Pits of Volg" are perhaps the most famously debased. The pits feature savage and unwholesome beasts pulled up from the depths below and dumped into a broad, high-sided tank filled up to a half-metre depth with corrosive waste. Driven into a pain-fuelled frenzy by the burning mirk, the creatures rip each other apart whilst the onlookers place wagers. For more "entertaining" games, human fighters (usually either prisoners or outright psychotics who have volunteered), also do battle on a treacherous series of platforms, I-beams and cables set above the pit where the creatures scream and die—any loss of footing leads to a horrific demise either in the corrosive sludge or at the creatures' less than tender mercies.

#### **Finding a Game (Volg)**

Pale Pits are Common on Volg and Scarce on other worlds. Usually, there is no limit to wagers. As well, Pale Pits are also home to a thriving black market and illicit or illegal goods can be found along the pit's periphery—but beware you don't end up on the night's show bill!

#### **The Resusatrix Chamber**

A medicae device intended to speed and aid the healing process. The resusatrix takes the shape of an upright tube-chamber in which the subject is placed and hooked up to sedation, drug-regulation and life-support systems, suspended in a thick curative solution of fluids, antinecrotics and proteins. Thanks to the level of sophisticated technoarcana required in their construction and maintenance, these chambers are often confined to the medicae facilities found on hive worlds and other tech-advanced locales, although some noble houses, ship's captains and guilds are resourced enough to have their own.

The chamber halves the length of time normally taken to heal Wounds naturally. It also prevents infection and adds a +10 bonus to Toughness Tests to overcome the effects of most poisons and diseases. In the case of serious injuries, surgery and other attention may still be needed as appropriate. While in the chamber, the character may do nothing but float in a drugged sleep. The various bio-auguries fitted to the chamber also count as a medical auspex and grant +20 bonus to Medicae Tests to diagnose the patient.

The chamber may only be operated successfully by a character possessing both the Medicae and Tech-Use skills.

*"There is no truth in flesh, only betrayal. There is no strength in flesh, only weakness. There is no constancy in flesh, only decay. There is no certainty in flesh but death."*

— Credo Omnissiah.

F orge Worlds are the sovereign domains of the Priesthood of Mars and places where wonders and terrors abound. A

There is no accounting for all the technological marvels and arcane miracles of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and so what follows is a mere sampling of what might be encountered in the forge worlds and domains of the Machine God's priesthood in the Calixis Sector. Each forge world is a leviathan of industry, a realm of metal and fire, smoke and ceaselessly turning gears, where superstition has overturned reason and ritual has murdered progress, a thing of vast scale and tireless motion, where human life is worthless and the quest for power and control are everything. Here are the devices employed by those hailing from forge worlds, techno-arcane devices of such potency and sophistication they have no rival in the wider Imperium, hand weapons, personal gear, servants and cybernetics, each no less strange nor any less potent in their own way than the striding Battle Titans or the city wide foundries one might more readily associate with a forge world.

### Ranged Weapons Rang ed Weapons

The Tech-Adepts are capable of creation weapons of incredible destructive ability. The following ranged weapons are but a sample of their curious arts. T

#### **Exotics Graviton Gun** Exotics

**Class:** Exotic (Graviton Gun)

An extremely rare device, the so-called graviton gun is a little understood relic unlikely to have been originally designed as a weapon at all. When fired at a target area, the energy field generated by the gun creates a sudden and powerful gravitational flux. Whilst unlikely to do more than knock living creatures violently to the floor, the effect can be extremely damaging to the internal mechanisms and moving parts of vehicles, and can be particularly lethal to skimmers and other devices with their own grav-engines quickly destabilised and overloaded by the flux-field.

Everything caught in the gun's blast area is violently pressed to the floor and must take a Very Hard (–30) Strength Test or be knocked down. Being thrown to a solid surface from a standing position and forced to the ground in this way is enough to inflict 1d5 I (Primitive) Damage—treat this as effecting the Body

location—although what the character or object is thrown against and how far they fall may well make this effect far worse.

Additionally, anyone attempting to move or perform physical actions within the blast radius for 2d5 Rounds afterwards must first pass an Opposed Strength Test versus Strength 60 (Unnatural (×2)) each Round—see More Than Human on [page 226](#page-226-0) for more details on this kind of Test).

At the GMs discretion, the flux may shatter brittle objects, collapse loose flooring, rupture containment vessels, damage vehicles and machinery, plus wreak any other chaos deemed appropriate.

#### **Rad-Cleanser**

**Class:** Exotic (Rad-Cleanser)

Rad-cleansers are potent weapons said to be relics of the longpast Dark Age of Technology, and they are certainly powerful and terrible enough in effect to justify that mythic claim. Victims caught in the rad-cleanser's blast suffer an agonising death as their tissues are blown apart on a cellular level and they are boiled alive from within. Even metals may combust in the powerful blast created by a rad-cleanser. These horrific weapons are extremely difficult to manufacture and heavily proscribed by the Cult Mechanicus They are however not as rare amongst the Magos retinues of the Calixis Sector as they are elsewhere, pointing to some Archmagos or facility in the sector that possesses the baleful secret of their construction.

The "toxic" effect listed on this weapon's profile actually represents massive radioactive contamination, and should be treated accordingly. Rad-cleansers must be reloaded by refuelling their bulky reactor-core units, which cannot be done during combat.

#### **Aegis Anbaric Shock Blaster Pistol**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Shock Blaster)

This unusual weapon is a rarity, even among the Magos militant and the Skitarii, and is doubtless a product of the legendary Aegis Fragment. Taking the shape of a bulky, tubular pistol, when fired it discharges a blast of electromagnetic force capable of completely overloading a human's nervous system or just as usefully disrupting the control systems of a rogue servitor. These weapons are configured to use standard laspistol power packs, though because of their high-energy requirements, they get only a relatively few shots from each pack.

#### **Las Weapons D'laku Crusade-Pattern Hellgun** Las Weapons

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Dating back to the Skitarii cohorts that joined in the Angevin Crusade to conquer the Calixis Sector, this pattern of high-power, rapid discharge lasweapon remains unchanged as the standard armament of the elite Skitarii Secutor squads. As well as delivering a larger charge, hellgun blasts are more focused than those of a lasgun and capable of easily punching through light armour, inflicting distinctive "through-and-through" burn wounds on their victims. These matte-black weapons receive energy from a power capacitor usually attached to the backpack of the Secutor's carapace armour, but can use standard lasgun power packs if needed, although they will only get twelve shots from a pack before exhausting it. The D'laku hellgun as an availability of Scarce in the Lathe system and Very Rare on other Forge Worlds.

> **D'laku Crusade-Pattern Hellgun**

#### **The Lathes Of Calixis**

The greatest forge world of the Calixis Sector is not a single world at all. The Lathe System, gifted to the Adeptus Mechanicus in perpetuity during the Agevin Crusade, is a place of strange wonder and arcane science. A trio of semihabitable planets in anarchic, fluxing orbit around their violent blue-white sun, Lathe-Het, Lathe-Hesh and Lathe-Hadd lie at the centre of the system. The population toiling in the massive macro-foundries based there to exploit the unique gravitation fluxes are huge, heavy set brutes more Ogryn in stature than man. They are but one part of the story, for scattered throughout the planetary system are dozens of vast city-sized orbital stations and hundreds of mining and research ouposts, hulks, asteroid bases and scores of vast steelglass-domed agrology platforms—arbours of green and blue that provide food and water amid the frozen void. Access to the inner system is strictly controlled by automated ward ships and the Magos Militant commanding the massed power and might of the Mechanicus, capable of calling in extremis on the dread might of the Titans of Legio Venator who are said to have a hidden fortress on the dead moon of Lycosidae at the system's heart. The outer fringes of the system are somewhat more receptive to visitors, and it is here at the trans-shipping orbitals that the great Chartist vessels and Mechanicus high-liners put in to trade and to export the Lathe System's vast output, whilst also feeding its equally vast hunger for ore and metal. Fiercely independent and beholden to none but the lords of distant Mars, the Lathe System's near five billion inhabitants answer only to the Archmagos council of the ruling Lathe-Covenant, and here the rule of the Omnissiah holds absolute sway.

In addition to seeing military service, this sophisticated plasma pistol is offered for sale by the Mechanicus weaponsmiths of the Lathes at an exorbitant price for those who wish to purchase its sacred power. Just why this rare and potent device of the Omnissiah's divine wrath is available for sale while other lesser weapons are not remains another inscrutable mystery of the Mechanicus.

The Kronos has two settings: on the maximal setting it consumes three shots from the clip at once, and requires two Rounds after firing to recharge.

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons Panoptic 0-5 Automata Pistol** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

The construction of these weapons is, by ancient tradition, one of the tests of craft that each would-be techpriest armourer must undertake under the tutelage of the Myrmidon Warsmiths of the Panopticon Orbital in the Lathe System. Aspirants are given a complex and randomly incomplete pattern for the weapon, and through skill and divination must produce a working gun to their master's satisfaction. The successful finished articles are then offered up to the Omnissiah as a sacrifice, and vaporised on the plasma-fire altars of the Machine God. It is quite common for the tech-priests who have studied at the Panopticon to continue to make these pistols in this ritualistic way as a form of mediation and to hone their skills, either using them as personal armaments or giving them as gifts to favoured servants, or more rarely offering them for sale.

These intricate automata-guns feature two separate ammunition cylinders and count as being fitted with a Fire Selector (see Dark Heresy page 142).

#### **Skitarii Vanaheim-Pattern Assault**

### **Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

A robust and tested design, this compact auto-loader shotgun is the standard armament of the Skitarii-Provosts who take the role of the enforcers found on other worlds. Provost enforced law and order is as coldly and absolutely maintained as their machine-minded masters could wish, and any sign of disorder, be it the discovery of a petty crime ring in the worker-habs or a full blown labour-helot uprising, is brutally put down with uncompromising and lethal weapons such as this.

The Vanahiem shotgun features an inbuilt red-dot laser sight and a melee attachment in the shape of a retractable saw-bladed bayonet as standard.

— Principia Esoterica.

#### **Breacher**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Breacher)

A breacher is a high-power drilling device made from hyper-dense adamantine alloys and fitted with a matter-wave generator, designed to drill through the toughest materials and ore deposits, break up blocks, and puncture bulkheads. Sometimes carried as a heavy slung rig, but more commonly implanted into the flesh of a servitor or bonded labourer, the breacher can also be used as a devastatingly potent weapon, cable of ripping through armour and flesh like paper.

Because of its bulk and vibration when activated, unless mounted as a purpose-built implant, a Strength Bonus of at least 5 is required to wield a breacher as a combat weapon. Weaker characters suffer a –10 WS penalty for each point of Strength Bonus below 5. If a breacher successfully causes Righteous Fury (see Dark Heresy page 195) the additional Damage caused is 2d10 rather than 1d10.

**"Strike fast and suddenly. Attack without warning. Secure victory before the foe is aware of his danger. Remember always, a war is easily won if your enemy does not know he is fighting."**

#### **Sollex-Aegis Energy Blade**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

A product of information obtained from the Aegis Data Fragment and utilising the properties of the Sollex focusing crystals, this is one of the rarest type of weapons in the Imperium—a blade of coherent high-energy plasma which materialises from the armoured hilt as a blazing, roaring column of blue-white fire. Devastatingly powerful, only a few Sollex-Aegis energy blades are held by individuals outside of the Mechanicus, and their secrets are little understood even by their makers in the mysterious Tech-Priest sect of Sollex. Although potent beyond even most power weapons, they can also prove treacherous to the unwary as the energy blade can fluctuate, the laser containment fail or the insubstantial blade slip unexpectedly.

Whenever a wielder successfully Parries another weapon while using an energy blade and succeeds with two or more degrees of success, the wielder automatically destroys the other weapon. While the energy blade does have a degree of density and mass, physical force applied to the swing contributes nothing to the weapon effect and the wielder's Strength Bonus does not increase its Damage. Should an Attack or Parry attempt with one of these weapons suffer a failure by five or more degrees, resolve the energy blade's Damage against the wielder.

Owing to the harsh actinic light and furnace-blast roar that the blade produces, the wielder cannot attempt to be stealthy while it is switched on. Additionally, the blade consumes canister fuel, just as a plasma pistol does, with each canister worn on the belt and fed via a cable to the hilt (good for 10 rounds of continuous operation).

#### Table 5–2: Forge World Melee Weapons

# IV: Hive & Forge Worlds

# **Omnisian Axe**

**Class:** Melee (Power) A holy icon of the Cult Mechanicus, the Omnisian axe or glaive is granted to adepts who have shown their faith to the Machine God in battle. No common weapon, it is forged with the finest materials and using secrets of tempering and field generation. These fearsome weapons have no equal amongst power weapons. Saw-toothed and marked with sacred equations, to the followers of the Machine God, the bearer of an Omnisian glaive is a most blessed figure, a furious incarnation of the Machine God's power in war.

The bearer of an Omnisian axe receives a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests involving followers of the Machine God. The Omnisian glaive also functions as a multi-tool. An Omnisian axe may never be bought or deliberately obtained—it is gifted only to tech-priests by their superiors.

#### **Vivisector**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Vivisector)

The Vivisector is a long ornate gauntlet that locks over the user's forearm. Servo-augmented articulation extends over the fingers, which are tipped with laser cutters, bio-solvents, shears and flensing instruments. While the ignorant may confuse the Vivisector with a medical device, this is no instrument of healing. Designed to dissect and portion organic tissues in the flesh works of forge worlds, it can be turned into an unwieldy but horrific weapon at a whim.

A Vivisector grants the wielder a +10 bonus on Interrogation and Intimidation Tests, as well as a +10 bonus to Medicae Tests for the purposes of repairing servitors or conducting autopsies. For an additional 500 Thrones, the Vivisector may also be fitted with injector rigs, giving it the additional quality of Toxic.

#### **The Warriors of the Machine God**

In the Calixis Sector, the fiefdoms of the Machine God maintain a strong martial tendency as befits their origins as domains first conquered and won during the Angevin Crusade. As well as the awesome might of the legendary Titan Legions, it is the Skitarii Tech-Guard, also known as the Forge Guard, that form the rank and file of the armed forces of both the Adeptus Mechanicus and the ancient War Houses linked to the Cult Mechanicus. The Skitarii serve to defend their master's domains and carry the priesthood's wrath to their enemies. The Lathe System and their dominion territories are known to maintain large and heavily armed Tech-Guard forces to protect their interests, commanded by the feared Secutors and Magos Militant, tech-priests devoted purely to the science of war and the art of destruction. It is also whispered among the Omnissiah's faithful that more ancient and terrible forces than the Skitarii can also be found in the secret holdfast of the Panopticon Orbital station hidden at the centre of the Lathes' treacherous asteroid belts. Here it is claimed the Myrmidons walk; masters of the mysterious Ordo Reductor, they are said to be towering and fearful figures decked out in blood-red and black robes, bearing the forbidden weapons of a bygone age. Even wilder legends speak of this place as the home of mech-assassin covenants and the dread Magister Samadhi – beings who most Magos consider no more than a dark myth. Some even speculate that the Panopticon's rulers are members of a secret order known as the Lords Dragon, an ancient and powerful cabal of Archmagos tasked with policing the Mechanicus itself. Whatever the truth of these tales, the Panopticon is regarded as a bellicose and dangerous place, and a destination of perilous pilgrimage for those of the Omnissiah's faithful who wish to perfect the lores of weaponcraft. Not all who journey there return, and those that do are often darkly changed by the secrets they have learned.

# Armour Armour

<span id="page-137-0"></span>*"From the weakness of the mind, Omnissiah save us, From the lies of the Antipath, circuit preserve us, From the rage of the Beast, iron protect us, From the temptations of the Fleshlord, silica cleanse us, From the ravages of the Destroyer, anima shield us, From this rotting cage of biomatter, Machine God set us free."*

— Chants of the Journeyman, Verse III/w-k-03.

The same innovation and expertise that tech-priests bring to weaponry can be found in their various forms of armour. T

#### **Amulet of Warding**

Often fashioned into the familiar cog and skull symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus, these rare, fist-sized amulets contain powerful refractor field generators capable of warding off the fiercest blows and most violent assaults. Rarer yet, the Mechanicus might offer such an item as a gift or to seal some great bargain, fashioning the generator into some other pleasing or appropriate form.

This amulet functions as a force field. Any time the wearer is attacked, he may roll 3d10 and reduce the Damage dealt by the sum of the dice. Should the wearer roll double ones, the attack bypasses the field completely (do not reduce the Damage). If the wearer rolls double tens, the field overloads and shuts down for 1d10 Rounds. In the case of an overload, the wearer must roll an extra 1d10. On a result of an 8, the amulet is burned out and cannot be used again.

While activated, the air around the user visibly ripples and crackles intermittently with static discharge. This effect imposes a –20 penalty on all Concealment and Stealth Tests. A field may not be activated for more than one hour without burnout occurring: the amulet requires two hours to recharge once it has been used. Activating a field is a Half Action.

#### Table 5–3: Forge World Armour **Armour Location(s) AP Wt Cost Availability Covered Advanced Armour** Dragon Scale Head, Arms, 8 20kg 7,500 Tech-Priest Body, Legs Only **Force Field** Amulet of Warding Head, Arms, † 1kg 30,000 Very Rare Body, Legs

#### **Dragon Scale**

Worn by the warrior tech-priests of the Magos Militant and the field enginseers assigned to frontline duty with the Imperial Guard, each set of dragon scale is individually hand-forged from adamantine and ceramite plating and woven with prayers of permanence and micro-etched with fractal incantations of defence. Offering protection equivalent to the finest powered armour, dragon scale's greatest advantage is that it is designed to interface directly with the tech-priest's cybernetic body and draws its power from his potentia coil, never needing to be recharged while worn.

This armour includes a photo-visor and a respirator. In addition, it increases the wearer's Strength Characteristic by +10. This armour requires the user to be fitted with a cybermantle and potentia coil.

#### <span id="page-138-0"></span>Implants & the Blessings of the Omnissiah Imp lan ts & The Blessings of the Om n issia h

*"No flesh shall be spared."*

— The MkXIII Cantos.

The following systems and implants expand on those described in the Cybernetics section of Dark Heresy and follow the same rules for cost, quality, surgery and recovery as presented in the core rulebook. These enhancements represent a sampling of the kind of modifications that flesh endures on forge worlds in service to the Omnissiah, and the sorts of blessings a Magos might perform on others for the right fee or boon. T **Injector Rig**

#### **Chem Implants**

These internal systems are often copies of ancient biotech designs made to automatically dispense stimms and other drugs directly into the user's bloodstream. The most advanced of these systems are rare and arcane surgical implants whose use is often limited to elite Skitarii warriors and the dreaded mech-assassins. For the right price, however, the Mechanicus will perform this surgery on anybody, and many great house or guild agents and even nobles undergo it. Far cruder, but no less effective, are more primitive injector-rigs, the product of heretek workshops and renegades made for eager gang-heavies, blood-hungry mercs and cyborg pit fighters—they can turn the most unwilling subject into a savage killer.

#### **Chem Gland**

These rare and expensive implants are wonders of the biosculptor's craft. Invisibly concealed within the body are miniaturised chemical factories that consume the user's own natural resources to synthesise powerful chemical agents.

Pick up to three substances when the implant is performed (such as Stimm, Panimune, and so on). The character can "gland" any one of these at will as a Half Action by succeeding on a Routine (+10) Toughness Test. A failed Test however inflicts a level of Fatigue. A failure by four or more degrees deals 1d10 points of Toughness Damage.

#### **Injector Rig**

These relatively crude cybernetic systems are obviously artificial and might include arrays of intramuscular hypodermics or flesh-wielded drug tubes linked to bulky chem-canisters sutured to the user's back. These rigs may contain ten doses of up to four separate substances at once (most commonly Frenzon, Slaught, Stimm and De-Tox).,Injecting one of these is a Half Action and the effects are instant. Depending on the nature of the rig, it may be triggered either by manual control or by remote control by some other individual (particularly if the user is a slave fighter). As well as the normal dangers of excessive drug use and the drugs themselves, if the user suffers a Critical Hit, there is a chance that the injector malfunctions and poisons him. The character must succeed on a Toughness Test or the injector deals 2d10 points of Damage, ignoring Armour Points.

#### **Concealed Weapon Bionic**

Using a pre-existing bionic arm, a pistol or a short, singlehanded melee weapon can be modified and implanted as a concealed device. Weapons concealed in this fashion can be deployed and readied as a Half Action.

**Poor:** The bionic weapon functions as normal, but gains the Unreliable Quality. In addition, the weapon cannot be removed with a Disarm, and locating the weapon requires a detailed inspection or a successful auspex scan.

**Common:** As Poor, but the weapon loses the Unreliable Quality.

**Good:** As Common, but the weapon functions as being best craftsmanship.

**Disadvantage:** Any catastrophic Jam or Overheat automatically disables the limb in question as well as the weapon.

#### **Hermetic Infusion**

As another departure from the frailties of the flesh, the infuser system replaces human blood and blood processing organs with a far more efficient biomechanical serum, the most advanced forms of which contain legions of microscopic homunculitic machines that can search out and repair damage on a cellular level with frightening speed.

**Prerequisite:** Tech-Priest, Autosanguine talent.

**Common:** The tech-priest gains a +10 bonus on Tests made to resist toxins, diseases and radioactive contamination. As well, the tech-priest gains the Die Hard talent.

**Good:** As Common, but the bonus on Tests increases to +20 and the tech-priest gains the Regeneration trait.

**Disadvantages:** Aside from a greying of the flesh and visible withering of the tissues, Hermetic Infusion has one marked side effect: the tech-priest's body can no longer use human blood, and so cannot be treated for Blood Loss or severe injuries by transfusion or regular medical treatments. Instead, the tech-priest must look to his own care (if possible) or that of a Magos Biologis to replace his lost serum.

#### **Mining Helot Augmetics**

A forge world is a hungry monster, devouring raw materials without pause or satiation. This hunger is fed by the blood and sweat of countless indentured labours (known as helots) and servitors who toil to feed the macro forges and titanic foundries. The Machine God is not without gifts for those that labour to feed it. In the deep mines, the helots are fitted with massive implant-drills and rams bonded into their nervous system, and their bodies are augmented to better perform their duties. Such improvements are often crudely fitted, and endlessly recycled for use again after the failure of their current fleshy housing.

**Common:** Mining Helot Augmetics give the character an extra limb fitted with a breacher (see [page 135\).](#page-135-0) This implant increases the character's Strength and Toughness Characteristics each by +10, thanks to surgically implanted muscle tissue and bionic skeletal reinforcement.

**Drawbacks:** Unfortunately, the side effects of these somewhat crude and bulky flesh-metal fusions reduce the character's Agility Characteristic by –10. These implants are performed with little thought given to the level of pain or discomfort they inflict, thus recipients gain 1d10 Insanity Points.

#### **The Calixian Domains of the Mechanicus**

While the Lathes are the most widely known and undoubtedly powerful Mechanicus domains in the Calixis Sector, there are numerous other minor holdings, ranging from unmanned explorator way stations, to mining outposts, colonial satrapies and research facilities. Here are a few of the more unusual domains.

#### **Heterodyne Station**

Once little more than a forgotten feudal world of Uziel on the edge of the Hazeroth Abyss, a century ago this colony was ceded as a result of political manoeuvrings into Mechanicus control. The Magos have maintained a surprisingly light hand, subtly influencing the planet's development and infiltrating its ruling elite with advisors. As a result of their efforts, the world has thrived. Now feudal primitivism and the techno-arcane exist side-by-side. It is a world where cyber-augmented beasts pull the ploughs in fields still sown by hand, and liveried gun-servitors patrol the battlements of stone castles. The aristocracy has begun to embrace the Omnissiah and its servants as the ultimate guarantee of their power. Whether this unusual approach by the world's distant overlords is some generations-long experiment or some rarely used but established practice of the Mechanicus remains unknown.

#### **Sheol 17**

In the icy outer sphere of a star that has no name other than a blank codifier sequence, lies the Mechanicus facility known in encrypted transmissions as Sheol 17. Built around a jagged ferrous asteroid mass, the facility is a vast, open framework of struts and pipes that carry life support feeds to the sealed units that hang there like spiders' nests clustering in the shadowed branches of a dead tree. Each isolated unit is up to half a kilometre in length and holds up to a thousand breathing souls. Sheol-17 is a prison; here techno-heretics that have sinned against the holiness of the Machine God are condemned to be kept until the Mechanicus is certain that their heresy does not reveal some truth or lead to accomplices yet unpunished. When certainty is reached, prisoners are taken to the heart of the machinery and their flesh put to use as a servitor, their bodies blessed to serve the Omnissiah until it proves its weakness and fails, the graven rune of Sheol burned into their skin as a warning to others.

#### **The Hippocrasian Agglomeration**

The Hippocrasian Agglomeration orbits the lifeless world of Morwen VI, a planet whose life was stripped from it by orbital bombardment at the outset of the Adrantian phase of Angevin's great crusade. The Hippocrasians are a sect of the Biologis concerned with the death of flesh: how it occurs, what brings it about and how it can be halted. What purpose the Adrantine fringes are to them is not known, but the planet's scorched and ash-coated surface suits the needs of the Hippocrasian sect. The area has drawn more and more Magos who hold common fascinations with the nature of life and death, and who wish to pursue their work undisturbed. Today, Morwen VI is orbited by an irregular agglomeration of ships that now make up one of the largest and most secretive Mechanicus independent facilities in the sector, and a frequent layover for explorator ships wishing to travel the Nebula.

#### **The Rite of Setesh**

Utilised by the rich and powerful whose fear of death is sufficient to overcome their love of humanity, these augmetic rigs (known in Mechanicus lore as the Rite of Setesh) involve the living mummification of a dying body and its emplacement in an all-encompassing exoskeleton designed to keep an advanced aged or disease-ravaged body alive long past natural limits, trapping the body in what amounts to little more than a semi-mobile iron coffin devoid of human contact. The use of these augmetics is largely frowned upon even by the Mechanicus as skirting the edge of technoheresy in form and function. In the Calixis Sector, only the isolated and independent Magos Biologis of the Hippocrasian Agglomeration are willing to fashion these implant systems, and only then for a price that would beggar a king.

**Common:** This rite grants a character the Machine (4) trait (except this Trait does not affect his or her mind) and the Regeneration trait. Wounds and mental characteristics are unchanged.

**Drawbacks:** The character reduces Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Agility to half (round down). Life in one of these devices is nightmarish and painful. The character gains 2d10 Insanity Points. Also, the rotted biology contained within adds +5 to any Critical Effect inflicted against the character.

#### **Vehicle Interface Circuitry**

Interface circuitry is one of the greatest treasures preserved from the golden past by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Glimmering neuron-interface circuitry implanted into the tissues of the hands allows an intuitive interface between a pilot and his craft. The most famous examples of implanted interface circuitry are from Galvia in the Scarus Sector, but certain forge worlds have the designs and capacity to create such wonders, one being the vast Myromentz orbital station in the Lathe System.

**Common:** Interface implants grant a +10 bonus on Pilot Tests when operating any vehicle with interface receptors. In addition, a character equipped with this circuitry may also make a Perception Test (Difficulty set by the GM) to determine a vehicle's status and condition as a Free Action.

*"Once We Were Gods."*

— Opening statement of the *Proscribed Techno-Heretic Text "In defence of the future; a logical discourse",* M.38.

Servitors are automatons or robots whose basic control components are organic and most often human in origin. The process of creating a servitor purges the higher brain functions and psychic pattern of the subject thus destroying the personality and will, rendering it a blank slate to be programmed. Servitors can vary very widely in form and function, from crude but powerful industrial models, to the faceless mass of basic labour drones, to gilded and unique creations built to serve the needs of the wealthy and powerful. S

#### **The Janus Simulacra**

These human-form servers are advanced indeed, often containing only the barest minimum of living tissue. They skirt the edge of the direst techno-heresy with their cogitator-assisted cortex functions and seeming parody of human responses. Playthings of the most fantastically wealthy, simulacra are often fashioned in the shape of gilded works of art—human-sized dolls come to life or seemingly animate statuary. But beneath their resplendent finery lives a clockwork heart and hydraulic-fed piston limbs slaved to a harvested living cortex and splicedin nerve ganglia. Despite the wonder and sophistication of these creations, only the most depraved or foolhardy would attempt the sin of passing one as human or aping sentience too closely, for to do so would provoke the unbridled wrath of the Cult Mechanicus, and entire worlds have burned for this transgression in the past.

# Familiars Familiars

<span id="page-142-0"></span>F amiliars are artificial creatures and constructs that slavishly follow and attend to their master. These are restricted to creatures smaller than an adult human (anything else would class as a servitor), and by their nature cleave to a single master unless instructed otherwise. Mostly, familiars do not possess any significant degree of intelligence and are trained or programmed to perform certain tasks on command. Familiars are either living creatures controlled by the mind of their master via arcane psyber neuro-implants or are cybernetic creatures controlled by voice or coded vox-signal command. Such slaved creatures are the strange fruit of ancient sciences and arcane superstitions, and the ownership and command of familiars utilise many technologies that the Machine Cult considers sacred. A trailing throng of bonded familiars is a sign of status both within the Mechanicus and the Imperium at large. F

#### **Controlling Familiars**  Controlling Familiars

In many respects, familiars function as other creatures. They have Characteristics, Skills, Talents, Traits and more. However, because of their servitude to their controller, they require special rules.

Familiars are controlled by their masters through the use of simple commands. These are generally single words, short sentences or the equivalent, and so giving a command is generally a Free Action. At the GMs discretion, the familiar may have to succeed on an Intelligence Test to interpret a contradictory or complex order.

Should a master come under attack, the familiar automatically moves to its master's defence, attacking the assailant unless it receives specific instruction (or possesses an instinct) to the contrary.

Upon completing a task, the familiar returns to its master's side unless it's received prior instructions or some other instinct applies.

#### **Creating a Familiar** Creating A Familiar

Familiars can be based on a wide number of living creatures, bio-constructs or pure automata. The easiest way to handle this is to create one by taking a creature from the Animal and Vermin list (Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics and Antagonists of Dark Heresy) and applying one or both of the following modifications that follow. Servo-skulls and cherubim are very particular kinds of familiar common to the Adepta of the Imperium, and are dealt with separately.

#### **Cyber-Creatures**

Cyber-familiars are semi-intelligent machine versions or cybernetic adaptations of living creatures controlled by a master, loyalty to whom is hardwired in the creature's brain. Some cyber familiars are created as assistants to serve prominent adepts and the Mechanicus, or merely as amusements for the wealthy, while others are fitted for war with implanted weapon systems and all manner of crude but effective augmetics.

**Modifications:** Any bestial creature of Scrawny Size or less may be upgraded into a cyber-familiar and is subject to the following changes:

- The creature gains the Machine (2) trait and +2 Wounds.
- The creature's natural attacks no longer count as Primitive.
- Increase the creature's Strength and Toughness Characteristics each by +5 and decrease Agility by –5.
- Very heavily augmented cyber-creatures intended for combat (or with little or no living tissue left), increase their Machine trait to (3 to 5) and gain the Fearless talent. In addition, if their creator wishes, they also lose the Bestial trait.

The cyber-creature may also have numerous items of equipment or weaponry implanted within their bodies just as a human can, such as a respirator, auspex or gun (see Cybernetics on page 153 in Dark Heresy). Specific programming or systems that duplicate the effects of pertinent Talents, Skills or Traits to use such devices can be included by means of cortical implantation.

If a cyber-familiar ever suffers from a failure of four or more degrees on a Willpower Test or suffers a Critical Hit to the head, there is a 50% chance for its programming to break down catastrophically and a debased form of its organic mind will take over. It then goes mad, savagely and randomly attacking everybody and everything in its path until it is destroyed.

# IV: Hive & Forge Worlds

#### **Berserker-Chip**

Also known as "lobos" and "butcher-jobs", these devices are surgically imbedded in the creature's brain. When triggered, the chip sends it into a near uncontrollable bloodlust and frenzy, backed by heavy doses of combat drugs pumping into its remaining organic tissues. These chips are activated either by a command word or signal sent directly to the beast.

Creatures under the influence of a berserker-chip gain the Frenzy talent (triggered instantaneously by codeword or signal from its master). While the implant is active they also gain temporary immunity to Characteristic Damage and Stunning (although they will suffer the effects as normal once the chip is shut off ). The chip is deactivated again by a command word or signal, after which the creature takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. Unfortunately there is a 10% chance each time the chip is used that it fails to deactivate, leaving the creature in an uncontrollable, frenzied state (although after a few hours the creature dies in any case from overexertion and shock).

#### **Example Cyber-Familiar: Adeptus Arbites Cyber-Mastiff**

Cyber-mastiffs are usually deployed under the control of Adeptus Arbites or enforcer units to bring down recidivists and heretics. Shaped in the form of a hound made of metal and guided by the brain and nervous system of a hunting creature, they are a fearsome extension of the Emperor's law, and a truly terrible sight to see unleashed.

**Skills:** Awareness (Per +10), Concealment (Ag +10), Silent Move (Ag +10), Swim (S), Tracking (Int +20). **Talents:** Double Team, Fearless.

**Traits:** Armour Plated, Brutal Charge, Enhanced Senses (Smell), Machine (4), Quadruped, Size (Scrawny). **Weapons:** Bite (1d10+3 R).

**Armour (Machine):** Head 6, Forelegs 6, Body 6, Hindlegs 6. **Gear:** (Implanted) IR vision implant, filter plugs.

#### **Psy-Bonded Familiar**

A psy-bonded (or psyber) familiar is a living creature bonded to its master by arcane technology. Interface circuitry in both familiar and master (called a psyber-lure) allows the creature to be directly and precisely controlled, with the master having access to the sensory experiences of the creature and able to give it instantaneous commands at great distance.

Owing to the idiosyncrasies of the little understood technology, usually only small non-sapient creatures can become psy-bonded. The creature must begin with both the Bestial trait and a size of Scrawny or less.

The range at which a character can influence a psy-bonded creature is equal to their Willpower Bonus in kilometres, although local conditions might limit this drastically.

A creature may be given both the Cyber and Psy-Boned upgrades. The cost of this implant is included in the cost of the familiar but note that the character will need to follow the rules for attaching implants (see page 153 of Dark Heresy).

Modifications: Increase the psy-bonded creature's Intelligence and Willpower Characteristics each by +5. Also, the familiar gains +1 Wound.

Special: A character with a Psy Rating of 2 or more treats their Psyber-familiar as a Psy-Focus and can extend the effects of their relevant psychic abilities to affect their psyber-familiars by increasing the target number of the power in question by +2.

#### **Example Psyber-Familiar: Psyber-Eagle**

Psyber-eagles are created as gifts from the Adeptus Mechanicus to the grandees of the Imperium. Within the Calixis Sector, most famously, Lord Hax himself is accompanied by a pair of psy-bonded eagles of prodigious size and splendour, gifts from the Mechanicus Fabricator-Lords of the Lathe System. The eagle's circle above him in the vast vaulted halls of the Lucid Palace, their eyes those of their master scanning from on high.

#### <span id="page-144-0"></span>**Servo-Skulls**  Servo–Skulls

Servo-skulls are human skulls (often that of a favoured servant or low ranking tech-priest) that have been fitted with rudimentary machine-spirits, support systems as well as an anti-grav motor to provide lift. These constructs are devoted to a particular task and have the basic equipment to carry out the purpose that they have been programmed to perform. Their advantages are their small size and manoeuvrability, which allows them to enter otherwise inaccessible spaces or hazardous areas that would endanger their operators, as well as the ability to act as additional "eyes and ears" for their masters. The servo-skull is synonymous with the Adeptus Mechanicus, who regard these creations as excellent servants and their machine-spirits as exceptionally faithful and pure. Servo-skulls can also be found serving faithfully with the other Adepta and the high-ranking elites of many hive worlds.

#### **Servo-Skulls as Familiars**

In most respects, a servo-skull behaves exactly like a voicecontrolled cyber-familiar. The greatest difference is that a servoskull has different instincts (programmed responses) and may be given additional commands. All servo-skulls hover above the ground and may remain stationary for any length of time.

#### **Guardian-Skull**

Designed with a somewhat reinforced structure and fitted with a single efficient weapon system and targeting selection programs, guardian-skulls (also known as gun-skulls and combat-skulls depending on their armament) are uncommon but prestigious and effective bodyguard devices. Their small size, tireless vigilance, and ability to hover in the shadows silently make them surprisingly discreet and effective servants.

| Guardian-Skull Profile |          |    |    |    |     |     |    |     |
|------------------------|----------|----|----|----|-----|-----|----|-----|

#### **Movement:** — **Wounds:** 5

**Skills:** Awareness (Per +20), Concealment (Ag +10), Dodge (Ag +10), Silent Move (Ag +20).

**Talents:** Fearless, Weapon Training talents appropriate to its armaments.

**Traits:** Dark Sight, Flier 6, Machine (3), Programmed Instinct, Size (Puny).

**Weapons:** Unarmed (1d10–3 I; Primitive), see following. Armour (Machine): Head 3.

**Combat- or Dissector-Skull:** Articulated limbs tipped with mono-edged blades dangle from the combat-skull. At their master's word, the combat algorithms embedded in the skull's circuits can be activated and it becomes a murderous device of whirling and slicing razor edges and mono-blades. The skull's usual natural attack is replaced with one that inflicts 1d5+2 Damage, Pen 2. The skull may not Parry with its mono-blades. Occasionally, combat-skulls are fashioned with other more potent weapons such as electro-flails and chain knives, but these are rarer and more costly.

**Gun-Skull:** A gun-skull is fitted with a single ranged weapon, such as an autocarbine or las carbine, although conceivably any Pistol or compact Basic weapon could be fitted—this might obviously increase the purchase cost and availability. The skull's gun is also fitted with a red-dot laser sight.

#### **SPECIAL RULES**

**Commands:** A guardian-skull can be commanded as per a cyber-familiar. In addition, the skull may be given the following orders:

**Guard:** Follow and protect its master or an assigned individual.

**Search and Destroy:** Methodically search a given area and terminate everything not on a predetermined list of exceptions.

**Sentry:** Guard a specific location, object or patrol a given area. **Programmed Instinct:** Unless the guardian-skull has been expressly ordered otherwise, it attacks and destroys anything that directly attacks or threatens its charge (with a "tolerance level" set by its master). In addition, it defends itself with deadly force if attacked. If its master is seriously injured, it interposes itself preventing further harm at the cost of its own destruction if needs be.

#### **Life In the Shadow of the Omnissiah**

Life on a forge world is harsh even by Imperial standards. The Adeptus Mechanicus grade, quantify and measure every child born in their domain to best find their use and how they might serve within the Omnissiah's great pattern. The most promising are inducted into the ministries of the Machine God, destined, in time, to find their place among the ranks of the priesthood. Of the rest, a percentage of the most physically able are subjected to the trials of the Skitarii and other more secretive castes. For the majority, however, there is a place, willing or not, within the forge world's vast webs of production. Such life-long service forms the mass of skilled workers that maintain the forge world's industries. These menials (or labour units as they are known) are free to make what lives they can for themselves in conditions largely no different from those found on most hive worlds, that is so long as work quotas are met, order maintained and their masters' arcane pursuits are not disturbed. For those that fail in their service, fall badly injured or are proven guilty of some crime, punishment is harsh as new labour-helots and organic servitor components are always in demand.

#### **Monotask-Skull**

The most common form of servo-skull encountered, monotask-skulls are designed and equipped to offer assistance with a particular task, and most are fitted with a basic set of extendable manipulator pincers and whatever else by way of gear their duty requires.

| Monotask-Skull Profile |          |    |    |    |     |     |    |     |

#### **Movement:** — **Wounds:** 4

**Skills:** Awareness (Per +20), Concealment (Ag +10), Dodge (Ag), Silent Move (Ag +10).

**Talents:** Fearless.

**Traits:** Commands, Dark Sight, Flier 6, Machine (1), Programmed Instinct, Size (Puny).

**Weapons:** Unarmed (1d10–3 I; Primitive).

**Armour** (Machine): Head 1.

**Gear:** The skull is fitted with a pict-relay allowing it to record or transmit what it sees and senses to its master or a linked cogitator, as well as onboard systems allowing it to navigate its surroundings, identify creatures and objects, and faultlessly retrace their paths. A monotask-skull is also specially fitted to conduct a particular simple task; some of the most common are listed here:

**Auger:** The skull is fitted with an auspex and vox-data system to relay its findings.

**Courier:** This skull is used as a messenger and comes fitted with a specialised identity scanner as well as extensive programmed maps of the local area and the like. The skull may simply carry a physical message such as a scroll or dataslate, or replay a recording from an internal holo-system.

**Illuminator:** The skull is fitted with a powerful lamppack or glow-globe, or indeed a burning brazier of coals (a particular favourite with the Ecclesiarchy).

**Loud Hailer:** The skull is fitted with a powerful public address system, and may replay recorded messages or sounds, or its master may speak through it.

**Medicae-Skull:** The skull has a built in medi-kit and medical scanner. It adds Medicae (Int +20) to its Skills, which it will use to administer first aid at its master's direction.

Utility: The skull is fitted with a multi-tool, and while it can perform simple programmed maintenance tasks, its real use is via its master operating the skull remotely as an extra pair of hands and to reach areas he could not otherwise access.

#### **SPECIAL RULES**

**Commands:** A monotask-skull can be commanded as per a cyber-familiar. In addition it is programmed to perform simple repetitive tasks based around its function (such as illuminate a certain room, conduct a message to a designated location, and so on).

**Programmed Instinct:** The skull will not attack or even defend itself unless expressly ordered to do so by its master, and even then it removes itself from harm's way if damaged. Likewise if stymied, interfered with or damaged, a skull returns to its master's side or base of operations.

#### **Cogitator Systems**

Machines created to sift and consider data, to calculate and to process the sacred language of algorithm, these devices range from small portable models to larger logos tabernacles and matriculation-engines integrated into manufactora, star ships and archive centres.

Using a suitable cogitator grants a bonus on Literacy, Logic and Lore Tests when having to compare or sift through large volumes of data.

#### **Emplaced**

These cogitator systems analyse and process vast quantities of data (planetary tithe records, genotype reconstructions, and so on). Most also feature auto-quills to print data-scrolls, machine-spirit shrines and symbiotic operations-savants or holo-projectors incorporated into their structure. They grant a +20 bonus on relevant Tests. Proper rites and rituals must be observed during cogitator operations on this scale or they will become subject to severe inaccuracies and glitches, perhaps even possession by malign spirits.

#### **Personal**

These portable units are capable of analysing the information from data-slates and similar sources, and provide a +10 bonus on relevant Tests.

#### **Grey Devices**

Strange brushed-metal boxes that seem to eat power and make chiming noises in response to unknown factors, socalled grey devices are small pieces of technology that have no clear purpose, carry a peculiar aura to them and seem to answer questions in some way. These odd devices first turned up in the ancient Pellucidan Tunnels, and are considered sacred mysteries to the Priesthood of Mars

but also have become a blasphemous item of superstition and forbidden games of prognostication for others. These heretics bait the machine-spirits of the grey devices hoping to make them respond, making a gambling game of it, while others treat them as auguries or links to the beyond. Some say the devices respond purely randomly or in ways barely understood let alone mimicked by a player, others that some contain "malifica", vile unclean spirits that lead the unwary astray.

**Finding a Game:** Trying to find a place offering games with a grey device requires an Availability Test on a forge world or Mechanicus domain with a –30 penalty. It is allbut impossible if the person trying to find it is a techpriest or in the company of tech-priests. If a device can be found, however, aside from its worth, it will often provide an introduction into darker things.

#### **Holo-Projector**

Cased in brass, crawling with chrome-sheathed cables and hissing steam, a holo-projector is a feature common to the briefing rooms of the various arms of the Adepta. The rituals of constructing and maintaining these devices are some of the most ancient and sacred. The flickering cone of blue-tinged imagery it projects is the product of muttered prayers and burning tapers. A holo-projector can be linked to a cogitator or other data feed.

#### **Hyper-Density Penetrators (Ammo)**

Famously nicknamed "Lathe Body-Blowers" for their appalling effect of ploughing through vulnerable flesh, these bullets are cast from a unique dense metal alloy only made possible by exploiting the strange gravitational forces within the Lathe System. Because of their great mass, they must be propelled by a far more powerful explosive charge than a normal round, and so are limited only to the sturdiest firearms capable of handling them.

**Effects:** Reduce the base range of the weapon by half. Increase its Penetration by 2. The weapon gains the Tearing Quality. Finally, an average man-sized target hit by one of these rounds must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test or be knocked off its feet from the impact.

**Weapons:** Hand cannon, hunting rifles, shotguns (lose the Scatter effect), bolt pistols and boltguns (weapon Damage type changes from X to I).

#### **Isotropic Fuel Rods**

A basic building block of Imperium technology, and truly a surviving wonder of the High Dark Age, these metre-long metal rods contain a concentrated liquid metal storage medium capable of holding vast quantities of energy. A single fully-charged rod is able to power a small settlement or entire hab-block for several weeks. The technology to create isotropic fuel rods is a jealously guarded Mechanicus secret, and the rods themselves are highly valuable commodities.

#### **Lathe Blade (Weapon Upgrade)**

The astronomical and gravitic alignment of the Lathe worlds creates the conditions for the production of metal alloys of rare and singular properties. Such a strange metal is used to fashion the legendary Lathe blade. So phenomenal is their strength and structure that they can have paper thin edges yet be flexible enough for the blade to resist breaking under the impact of the most powerful blows, and can even be unaffected by the devastating action of a power field. Some, including Lord Hax himself, favour a Lathe-forged blade over a power weapon such is their quality and repute.

**Effects:** A Lathe-bladed weapon loses the Primitive quality. Increase the weapon's Damage by 2 and its Penetration by +3. Wielders of these weapons gain a +10 bonus on Weapon Skill Tests. A Lathe blade cannot be destroyed by the effects of a power field and counts as having an Armour value of 25 if directly attacked. A Lathe blade is automatically of the Best Craftsmanship (the effects of this have already been included in these rules). This upgrade cannot be combined with the Mono upgrade.

**Weapons:** Knives, throwing knives, swords, axes and great weapons.

#### **Opus Machina**

One of the ancient names given to the skull and cog wheel symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Opus Machina is known throughout the Imperium and is as sacred to the servants of the Omnissiah as is the Aquila is to the Ecclesiarchy. The versions presented here are no simple symbols, but contain broadcasted code-ciphers and data-djinn to proclaim their master's worth to those that are pure enough to hear.

As long as the character knows how to employ it properly that is, has the Common Lore (Machine Cult) skill—the bearer of this symbol gains a +10 bonus on all Fellowship Tests concerning tech-priests and followers of the Machine God.

#### **Greater Icon of Passage**

This devices functions as a standard Opus Machina, but it also carries numerous code ciphers, over-ride decrypts, and effector fields, making it the equivalent of a set of multikeys (see page 151 of Dark Heresy), granting a +10 bonus on Security Tests made to disable alarms and commune with machine-spirits.

#### **Tempest Bolt Shells (Ammo)**

Tempest bolts shells are manufactured in one place only, Mars, the only world capable of exploiting the rare and potent technology needed to produce such arms. Tempest shells contain a powerful miniaturised plasma-shock generator that releases a pulse of electromagnetic and thermal energy as the shell detonates. Quantities of Tempest shells are held in the armouries of the Magos Militant of the Lathes and used to equip the tech-priest Destructor Covenants sent out to destroy hereteks and other rogue elements, as they are particularly effective at destroying corrupted or abominable machines.

**Effects:** Change the weapon's Damage class from X to E. The weapon also gains the Shock quality.

**Weapons:** Bolt pistols, boltguns and heavy bolters.

#### **The Tears of the Dragon**

The Adeptus Mechanicus makes extensive use of artificial psycho-viral infection to condition the minds of their servants via the use of so-called meme-viruses. The Tears of the Dragon is the name of one such rare and hazardous agent, used most often on the elite Skitarii Centurions. Once infected, the subject falls into a deathly fever, and is confronted with pre-programmed visions and sense-recordings of the worst horrors the Mechanicus have encountered in its long history. Those that survive this meme-virus fever with their minds intact have conquered fear and the frailties of human sanity.

After infection, the subject must succeed on a Difficult (–10) Willpower Test or gain 1d10+10 Insanity Points. A successful Test grants the character the Fearless talent but permanently reduces his Fellowship by 1d10 points.

*"The soles of my boots are caked with the dust of a hundred worlds, so mark what I say well for I know whereof I speak: the Emperor's Galaxy is filled in with hot, cold, steamy, dank, polluted, airless, swampy, gassy, icy and otherwise miserable planets. I'll allow that there are a few pleasant worlds, but docking fees alone will likely pauper ye on those. I say expect nothing pleasant in yer travels and you'll seldom be surprised."*  — Rogue Trader Kobal Aizdar.

The Calixis Sector sits on the very rim of the Imperium, beyond which lies only the cold dark. A considerable number of the planets within the sector are classified as feral or frontier, and even many of the so-called "civilized" worlds consist merely of a few hives set amidst environs as lethal as a fair number of death worlds. It is not a place that suffers fools lightly. To travel the Calixis Sector unprepared is to engage in protracted suicide. While a reliable weapon (or two, or three, or… well… many) is a good idea, no amount of force will hold off the deathly cold of Soryth or quench one's thirst amidst the Soot Warrens of Tranch. There are bioforms on Dusk that no Magos Biologis has ever heard of, and there are predators on Fedrid that would think nothing of consuming a Land Raider whole—with the right equipment one can come away from dealing with either relatively unscathed. As with all things else within the Imperium, knowledge is power. On the frontier, preparing to deal with the myriad of environments that one can and will face is at least as important as knowing how to fight. T

# Armour Armour

*"I've heard the vast number of hivers will never see the sky of their own home world, save once perhaps, the day they leave it forever as a member of the Imperial Guard. Having spent the greater bulk of my life under hostile alien skies that have frequently tried to kill me, I can say with some confidence that they haven't missed a thing."*

— Nikus Monns, Mercenary.

#### **Environmental Body Glove**

The rare travellers of the Imperium often despair over the many environments they must prepare for as they travel between systems. Bulky void suits are frequently impractical, especially when a given world's atmosphere is known to be merely unpleasant as opposed to fatal, and few are the sealed suits that actually provide any armour to their wearers. Travellers on the frontier have an especially difficult time of it, for if they discover a planet with unexpected environmental conditions, the proper equipment may be long months or even years of travel away. Several of the worthies of the various Malfian noble houses decided that the situation was intolerable and set about designing a series of body gloves designed to withstand multiple extreme conditions while still maintaining their wearer in relative comfort. The suits were a great success and various models are produced in small quantities on Malfi, Vaxanide, and Scintilla. "Environmental body glove" is a generic name for a wide variety of suits. Most are actually named after the house line that produces them, such as the "Mariette Envelope" or the "Hax Hostile" field body glove.

| Table 5–1: Frontier Armours |                           |   |      |       |              |  |  |  |  |

Environmental body gloves are full body suits designed to sustain their wearers at a constant temperature, despite external conditions, making them ideal as outerwear for desert worlds and a useful inner layer for particularly cold environments. Pockets within the suits recycle sweat and other bodily fluids, cooling or warming them as necessary, in order to regulate temperature and provide emergency water rations. The suits are waterproof, which makes them useful in marshy terrain and capable of doubling as a wetsuit when necessary. Environmental body gloves add +1 Armour Point to all locations and grant a +10 bonus on Survival Tests.

Such suits are almost invariably equipped with a re-breather, comm-bead and photo-contacts.

#### **Slither Boots**

There are a number of polluted environments within the Calixis Sector where the very soil itself is both destructive and toxic. Whether one has to trudge within the salt-fens of Acreage, over the acid storm wastes of Grangold, or through one of the deadly slime jungles of Vaxanide, the journey will be a short one if the ground itself eats away a traveller's footwear directly exposing them to their surrounding's toxicity—a common and frequently deadly occurrence for the unprepared. The destitute that live within such places cope as best they can, whilst the wealthy few acquire slither boots.

Slither boots are highly advanced footwear, incorporating a variety of materials including ceramite-woven leather and a circuitry embedded inner frame. Slither boots are designed to withstand the most hostile of environments, releasing chemicals to shield the wearer from acidic and alkaline environments. Slither boots do not slip; regardless of how tractionless a surface may seem, small tendrils emerge from the soles of the boots to help compensate for the movements of their wearer.

Slither boots provide a +10 bonus to Agility Tests made to maintain footing in treacherous or slick conditions and provide 6 AP (Legs) versus corrosives.

#### **Wind Armour**

A seemingly fanciful name for a suit of protective gear that deals with a very real problem, wind armour is produced by the Fane of Doru on Scintilla for the many worlds of the Calixis Sector that boast powerful storms. The infamous Splinter Winds of Barsapine travel at over 700 kilometres an hour and are more than capable of stripping a lightly armoured person to bone in less than 30 seconds. Against such force, even void shields are hard pressed to cope. Realizing that standing against the wind was ultimately foolhardy, the designers came up with a clever idea of creating a series of auto-reactive ceramsteel plates that would redirect wind force, allowing an individual to advance in lighter dust storms and, at the least, survive in the heavier ones.

Wind armour is formed from fully enclosed suits of medium articulated carapace. They incorporate a series of heavy air filters with a re-breather connected to an extra tank, allowing a wearer to breathe normally in all but the heaviest storms, with three full hours of breath should they be completely buried in dust. Each suit also has an inbuilt vox-system along with a photo-visor. Wind armour was primarily designed to defend its wearer from harsh environmental conditions, not opponents. While it is popular with explorers, it isn't nearly as useful in a fight as many other armours of similar class.

The wearer is immune to environmental effects of strong wind and dire storms.

<span id="page-152-0"></span>*"The key to overcoming failure is never accepting it."* — Magos Genetus Halix Redole.

#### **Aerial Pinions**

A somewhat misnamed apparatus, aerial pinions were not designed to allow a user to soar through the air, but rather to prevent divers from sinking to their deaths in the chemical oceans of Landunder. The "hanging" colonies of Landunder are mounted on the undersides of the planet's continents floating upon a vast chemical sea. Chemical mining, research and undercity maintenance must all be done "outside", which is when aerial pinions are employed. A set of pinions resembles a webbed body harness festooned with articulated blades each of which is connected to a coiled, reinforced ceramite line. The lines are in turn attached to small motors that contain integral highly specialised logic-engines. A diver using a set of aerial pinions typically connects two or more lines into the city or ground above, using the blades as either grappling hooks or spiking them deep into the crust of the planet, as the pinion's logic-engines dictate. Most harnesses support four blade-and-line sets, allowing a user to set two lines, while using the other two for cautious movement. Skilled users eventually upgrade to a six blade-and-line set and are capable of moving at truly remarkable speeds. A fully extended set of aerial pinions resembles a great pair of wings from a distance, hence the name.

There are rumours of acrobatic individuals finding uses for aerial pinions far from the chemical oceans of Landunder. There is no shortage of dark places where it would be useful to hide, unobserved and unsuspected, on many worlds. The upper shadows of a hive city are an excellent spot for an agile aerial pinion-equipped assassin to attack from. A character using aerial pinions can move at half his normal rate, but can neither Run nor Charge. A character using the advanced six blade-and-line aerial pinions can make an Agility Test in order to move at normal rates for as long as he wishes, until he comes to a stop. A separate Agility Test is required to use a Run or Charge Action. Failure indicates that one of the lines doesn't connect or one of the logic-engines fails momentarily, instantly halting the character. Three or more degrees of failure mean that the character has overstretched his aerial pinions' lines and become unmoored. On Landunder, that means he's sinking; elsewhere that he is probably falling.

#### **Beetle Tent**

The Cestelle Alliance was instrumental in the original creation of a series of collapsible bio-dome structures now known as "beetle tents" due to their distinctly insectoid profile, an easy to assemble portable bio-dome formed from polycarbonate sidings reinforced with plasteel rods. While not as easily transportable as a shelter made from cloth, beetle tents are far more durable in the face of hostile creatures and uncertain weather. Beetle tents have since passed into common use and are greatly favoured by officers of the Imperial Guard. The Cestelle Alliance's manufactora remain the largest producers of beetle tents in the sector, creating them in a variety of shapes and sizes. All of the Cestelle's bio-dome structures are modular, allowing them to be linked into larger structures as necessary. The exterior of a beetle tent invariably includes some sort of camouflage scheme, usually a jungle-based one, though desert camouflage is also common. Beetle tents have AP 8 (Primitive), though they can be reinforced with armoured panels for travellers expecting to encounter particularly hostile native fauna. There are two sizes of tent listed, holding up to a maximum of three or six adult humans respectively. The Extra Armour upgrade for a beetle tent increases its AP value to 12.

#### **Calixis Survival Kit**

One of the most basic pieces of gear any traveller should have, a survival kit contains a wide variety of equipment and supplies, all of which are intended to help their users survive in less than optimal conditions. Generally, if the owner of a survival kit is forced to rely upon their kit's contents, something has gone wrong—a particularly deadly prospect on an alien world. Several trade guilds within the Calixis Sector manufacture portable survival kits, with the ones produced by Haal-Lorden of Cantus particularly favoured, as that guild has held a contract to produce kits for the Imperial Guard for several centuries. There are many variants to be had and well-travelled users frequently tailor their personal survival kits to the specific environments they intend to find themselves within. A typical kit includes: two blade razors, an igniter, a Helite flexible wire saw, 14 multi-shape fishing hooks, five press weight lures, 25 metres of heavy fishing line, 1 very large hook, 10-metres brass snare wire, 1 highpowered pocket illuminator, one calibrated button compass with a Calixis Sector world specific guide page, four doses of stimm, six Alozith tabs (Alozith is a strong general-purpose antibiotic), 20 Ionis water purifying tablets, two flexi bags, one metre adhesive tape, three metres long Spinlin cord, half a metre of reinforced ceramite-woven tape, three metres of cotton sewing thread, three sewing needles of various sizes, one surgical needle, eight safety fasteners of various sizes, a metre square piece of foil, one narrow-quill with Watersure ink, two sheets of rolled Sure-Write paper, a mirror-finished plasteel case to hold the kit's contents and serve as an impromptu signalling device.

Survival kits add a +10 bonus to Survival Tests—the kit itself doesn't supply knowledge of how to survive, but it can provide the tools to do so.

#### **Camp Warders**

Travellers to the feral worlds of the sector often choose devices that encourage passing hostile native creatures to go elsewhere and without a fight if possible. One of the more sophisticated of these is the elegant camp warder, a small techno-arcane device with an appearance reminiscent of clockwork scorpions. Data-linked to a screamer (see page 151 of Dark Heresy), camp warders are buried within the soil surrounding a campsite. When the screamer detects an intruder, instead of releasing an audible signal it sends a silent alarm to the camp warders, which immediately converge on the intruder by swiftly burrowing underground towards it. Upon arrival, the camp warders begin quickly stabbing their tails up out of the soil into the intruder. The camp warders then begin "herding" the creature away from the main campsite with continuous painful jabs. While this doesn't cause any real damage, the frightening nature of the unseen assailants cause any being with the Bestial trait to immediately attempt a Hard (–20) Willpower Test or flee the area protected by the camp warders.

The listed cost includes a modified screamer and half a dozen camp warders.

#### **Redole Re-breather**

Widely considered amidst the greater triumphs of a muchcelebrated career, one of the legendary Magos Genetus Halix Redole's final contributions to the Imperium was an alternate form of re-breather that followed the philosophies by which he lived his life. Unsatisfied with what he deemed to be the "dual and therefore unfocused" use of the standard Imperial re-breather, Redole set out to create a device that would allow a user to stay underwater for a greater period of time than its predecessor. Instead of using purely mechanical components, Redole integrated vat-grown flesh versions of piscine gills with a series of increasingly complex helmets till he found the combination he sought. The Redole Re-breather is a helmet that literally draws breathable oxygen from the water around it, allowing a user to stay underwater indefinitely. As long as a Redole Re-breather's flesh components are kept wet, each has a functional life of around a decade before needing to be replaced. Even so, due to the effort and materials required to create one, only nobles and their elite cadres can afford to use them. Note that unlike a "standard" re-breather, Redole's device provides no protection against harmful air-born toxins as it only functions underwater.

#### **Poi-Savant**

Spending time in xeno environments means that sooner or later one will have to sample the "local" cuisine, which may not resemble anything one is used to. Indeed, some travellers try to opt for a plant or creature that has a "familiar" appearance, but this is no less dangerous—for the assumption that a given thing must be safe to eat based on resemblance is a foolhardy one. Enter the poi-savant. A hand-held cogitation device, the poi-savant measures various levels of bio-chemicals and searches for signs of a diverse number of dangerous toxins in any substance that it is used to analyse. Any substance the poi-savant clears as "edible" is safe for human consumption, though not necessarily appetizing.

Originally developed on Malfi, where the noble houses even now use them at every meal, poi-savants tend to be remarkably accurate devices as they have had well over a thousand years of field-testing. Indeed, many Malfian nobles make a point of commissioning their own personally tailored poi-savant, generally by miniaturizing them into elegant wands or ornate rings that they can simply pass over

their meals without appearing unduly concerned (or rude). Personal poi-savants must be updated regularly as new toxins are identified, leading to an ongoing race between their cogitators and the cunning of the countless assassins who constantly seek out new poisons in the hope that they will thwart their target's poi-savant. Poi-savants were specifically designed to be easy to use; their operator need only make a Routine (+20) Tech-Use Test to employ them correctly. A failed Test gives inconclusive readings, while a failure by three or more degrees indicates that a blameless substance is toxic or vice versa (GM decision).

#### **Shade-Servitor**

Hot environments are often doubly dangerous to travellers because they can compel visitors to a new planet to strip off their armour in order to withstand the heat, almost invariably a fatal mistake. Shade-servitors have no organic parts and are not, in fact, servitors in the strict Imperial sense of the word. They are relatively small devices resembling a cone surmounted by a series of ceramic lamellar blades that swiftly rotate in different directions. The devices hover about their master, using their blades as natural fans and parasols, occasionally supplemented with a cold blast of air sent over an internal cooling coil. Shade servitors have a small internal battery with a 12-hour reserve that constantly recharges via a series of photonic cells along their blades, allowing them to function near ceaselessly in hot, sunlit environments.

A shade-servitor is as much a statement of wealth as a practical device. They do assist in removing penalties due to heat and help to fend off Fatigue in hot environments (GMs discretion). Otherwise, they are merely a clear indicator of a given individual's wealth and tend to be adorned with intricate wood engravings or careful scrimshaw work. There are rumours of severely upgraded models, ones capable of hurling their blades to inflict lethal cuts or installed with a powered shield, but the veracity of such rumours is difficult to confirm.

#### **Sky Eye**

A techno-arcane device of great sophistication, a sky eye incorporates a small hovering sphere slightly less than two fingers wide with an elegant docking station containing a variety of holo-display modules. The sphere scouts out a chosen area within 15 kilometres of the docking station, a process that can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on the distances involved and the level of stealth asked of the sphere component. Upon the eye's return, the docking station produces perfect three-dimensional holomaps of the scouted area that can be downloaded to standard data-slates. Within the Calixis Sector, only the Adeptus Mechanicus brethren of the Lathes are known to be capable of producing such devices. Rumour has it the Inquisition has access to ultra-quiet sky eyes that incorporate camouflaging materials, which they use to scout out the interiors of rooms and buildings before entering.

The sky eye drone is a Minuscule object that can sustain only a single point of Damage before it is destroyed. It has the Flyer (8) trait. Attempts to detect the sky eye either by sight or hearing are at a –30 penalty.

#### <span id="page-154-0"></span>**Thermal Gloves**

To coreward of the Adrantis sub-sector lies the unique mining colony world of Soryth, an icy satellite famous for its rare frozen gas deposits. While the miners of Soryth are a hardy lot, the precision required for their work with tools is impossible to achieve with ice-numbed hands. A single spark from a misplaced strike can be fatal (and costly) in the sub-zero gas mines; so thermal gloves are somewhat of a necessity.

Thermal gloves are slender but sturdy gauntlets; thin enough to allow for delicate manipulation and lined with an assortment of circuitry that keeps them comfortably warm despite external weather. The power cells are incorporated into thin forearm shields in order to protect them from the elements. The energy in these cells can be used to power-up emergency ports on other equipment and, when doing so, provide a +10 bonus to Tech-Use Tests to restart generators, power up old data-slates and similar tasks. A full discharge from the generator cells can also be used to part-recharge a lasgun or laspstol clip as well, providing 1D5 shots of charge before draining the power cells entirely.

### Drugs & Substances Drugs & Su bstan ces

#### **Dryas (Drug)**

Dryas is a compound originally derived from a series of desert dwelling lizards native to the agri-world of Dreah, synthesized by Mechanicus explorators and available commercially as an emergency survival tool. Dryas causes biochemical changes in the human body enabling extended periods of survival in arid atmospheres or when there is no fresh water. Side effects of taking dryas include atrophied taste and smell, and a very unpleasant sense of weakness and lassitude. Few take dryas without an extreme need to do so.

A single dose of dryas lasts for three days. During that time, the character taking it receives a +20 bonus to Survival Tests made in arid environments and he requires only half of his usual water intake. However, he suffers a –10 penalty to all Strength and Perception based Tests while under its influence. In addition, those under its effects also suffer a –5 penalty to all Fellowship based Tests due to their slurred speech and vacant manner. Dryas is not addictive, but extended use can cause permanent systemic damage.

#### **Polygum**

*"Wot can yer do with it? Ha! Easier to figure out wot yer can't do with it, eh?"*

— Hrobe Dolson, Polygum Harvester.

A remarkable substance discovered by accident within the wide verdant forests of Ganf Magna, polygum was stumbled upon several centuries ago by a group of frontier farmers in the midst of an engagement with a large tribe of the feral Orks that continue to infest their planet in present times. Their weapons' fire had opened up the boles of a number of ancient trees, which proceeded to exude a thick sap. In between bouts of combat, one of the farmers observed that wherever the sap had blended with the dust of the dark purple lichen that covered the tree, it had ceased to flow. He soon discovered that the resulting matter had somewhat the consistency of rubber, but that it could be stretched and readily retained whatever shapes it was formed into. At first a useful curiosity, polygum drew even more positive attention when analysis indicated that it had substantive antibacterial properties, presumably due to its lichen component.

Polygum can, and has, been used to form countess items, though tarps, ponchos and makeshift slings are the most prevalent. It readily serves as a weather sealant and a few techpriests have been known to bless polygum in order to employ it as a suitable makeshift repair substance for holding machine parts together. An individual with the Medicae skill can employ a ball of polygum to automatically staunch a bleeding wound without a Test and it also serves as an excellent dressing. however, such use causes the polygum to crumble soon after. Polygum is now used throughout the sector, though its rarity makes it costly. It is one of Ganf Magna's sole exports and it is sent forth in small, cylindrical, carved wood containers.

# V: Frontier Worlds & The Void

#### **Ration Grubs**

The world of Dusk is far more famed for its extreme deadliness than the rare few creatures that can aid one's life instead of quickly ending it. Still, it is from the swamps of Dusk that the exceedingly useful ration grubs hail. Originally discovered during a survey by an Adeptus Mechanicus Genetor explorator team, ration grubs are a phenomenally rich source of nutrients. A single freeze-dried grub, which is about the size of a man's thumb, provides a subsistence level of nutrients sufficient for a full day, however, the grub's indescribably foul taste and trace toxins make it a poor choice for a long term diet.

Some seasoned travellers like to joke that, as natives of Dusk, ration grubs continue to be deadly to one's appetite if nothing else.

#### **Spectorin Coral Paste**

*"Three years spent orbiting such a rich abundance of sea life as to beggar belief. Three years of constant experimentation, straining the patience of my lords and patrons. Three years of knowing that millions suffer throughout this sector for want of food. Three years of failure. Our latest submersible was destroyed today, a thousand men lost in an instant to the titanic mouth of a Lantern Jaw. This world may not hate us, but it surely hates our works. It matters not. I will find a way. If it takes a millennia, I will find a way."*

— From the early personal data-files of Magos Genetus Halix Redole.

When the Lord Militant Angevin's world surveyors first discovered the water world Spectoris, they were delighted by the vast quantities of fish that the planet seemed to promise and readily noted it as a potential agri-world for future use. As the population of the Calixis Sector grew, so to did its need for food. In 312.M41, the Sector Governor declared that the time had come to begin harvesting the piscine crop of Spectoris, a task that was to prove far easier to order than to achieve. The Imperium swiftly found that the denizens of Spectoris routinely destroyed all foreign objects that were placed within the worldocean, effectively halting any large-scale collection efforts. For decades the legendary "complete ocean" held the Imperium at bay, leading many to believe that the world-ocean itself was sentient in some inexplicable manner.

#### **The Magos Genetus and the Adranti**

Genetor Redole's research on Spectoris turned up far more than has ever been revealed publicly. Spectoris's proximity to the Adrantis Nebulae led Redole to suspect it had at one time been a testing ground for the infamous deviant genetic tampering of the Adranti. This struck at the very core of Redole's beliefs and he swore to the Omnissiah that if it took him a lifetime, he would unlock the keys to wiping out the scourge of Adranti genetic corruption.

For more than four hundred years, Redole grappled with the twisted legacy of the Adranti. His lifelong efforts and the seemingly endless series of discoveries that his research uncovered eventually led to him being elevated to the exalted rank of Magos Genetus. When he knew that his life's fire was all but spent, he turned copies of the bulk of his research notes over to the Lathes and to the Ordo Calixis. Access to Redole's notes is tightly restricted, for every single person that has since dared to walk in his footsteps has uniformly gone mad… or worse. As for the Magos Genetus, while most believe him to be dead, some whisper that a master of the forces of life is not so easily toppled…

At last, frustrated by their inability to progress, the Adeptus Mechanicus turned to one of their more eclecticminded members, the somewhat infamous, Genetor Halix Redole. Genetor Redole was known to be associated with a faction within the Mechanicus known as the Organicists, a group of tech-priests who esteemed biological enhancement as being equal in value with the cybernetic, a somewhat radical if not heretical position from the tech-adepts point of view. Redole applied his keen intellect to the "Spectoris problem" for five years before hitting on a solution. The Genetor discovered that a form of sea life roughly analogous to terrestrial coral was attracted to certain chemicals. By blending the chemicals with a bonding agent derived from a Spectorin fish, Redole created the compound known as coral paste. The paste draws Spectorin coral to whatever it is applied to, soon creating a "natural" layer of sea life that causes the creatures of the world-ocean to regard the encrusted vessel as native. The Genetor's success opened the way to large scale Imperial harvesting, and coral paste is now regularly applied to all Spectorin ships, no matter their size, as well as being repeatedly caked across the entire hull of the planet's sole underwater habitat, Enkaidan. Coral paste has proven to be useful to the colonists of Spectoris as a makeshift hull repair agent on a number of occasions. Its utility is marred by the fact it must be reapplied frequently, else the coral covering can deteriorate with lethal results. Coral paste is a highly regulated substance due to the extreme value of a great many Spectorin species of fish, which inevitably brings poachers.

# <span id="page-156-0"></span>The Void The Void

*"Sure, there are dangers aplenty in the gulfs of the void and a ship is never quite big enough for comfort and who knows what flits in the chill of eternal night, but I'd take all of that over a foetid hive or the cruel embrace of a death world any day."*

— Dirty Fikke, Rogue Trader.

The worlds of the Calixis Sector may appear quite varied, and indeed they are, but no matter their unique environment and social development, they are all at the gross level just simple worlds of rock, water and air. There is another area in the sector, however, separated from these base planets that are home to countless millions. It is made of adamantium and glassteel, plasma reactors and atmospheric recyclers. It is the many vessels leaping through the warp in defiance of natural laws, orbiting worlds to defend or monitor, trading between societies but never being part of them, navigating by the Emperor's divine light alone. They make up a totally unique habitat, as varied as the myriad planets of Calixis are from each other but still unified as artificial constructs totally divorced from nature. T A

For most who travel through the void, such a life is all they ever know. Only a small percentage will ever actually touch real soil or breathe fresh air. To live in the void is to be apart from the rest of humanity, in worlds where light, air, food and even gravity are in the hands of faceless tech-adepts and enginseers who tend to the blessed life-sustaining machines. Here unseen creatures scuttle through abandoned decks and death is only a bulkhead's thickness away. Voyaging through the immaterium can taint even the most steadfast of souls, so the Inquisition keeps a watchful eye for irregularities. If stellar and interstellar transportation cannot be trusted, Calixis would swiftly collapse into a bedlam of isolated worlds, easy pickings for waiting predators.

#### Naval Bases & Commercial Stations Naval Bases & Comm ercial Stations

As benefits any major sector of the Imperium, the Calixis Sector boasts a wide range of naval and commercial facilities to support travel amongst its star systems. Only a fraction are listed below as even a standard system might have dozens of stations of their own to support cargo transfers, defence monitoring, research, and so on.

**Port Wrath:** A huge combination dockyard and naval base serving as headquarters for Battlefleet Calixis. It half protrudes from a metallic planetoid orbiting Mundus, a white dwarf star in the Golgenna Reach, and bristles with lance batteries matching the firepower of most fleets. Commanded for over fifty years by Rear-Admiral Zoila Kusch, this is the mainstay Imperial Navy installation in the sector.

**Port Gavinus:** Centred in the Golgenna Reach, Gavinus is one of the most popular commercial shipping stations in the sector. For the thousands of smaller merchant vessels who also ply the Scintilla-Sepheris Secundus-Iocanthus trade route (also known as the Golgenna Triangle) along with the Misericord, this serves as their home in space. On the surface a respectable base, the sheer amount of traffic means that a powerful underclass of black market dealing goes on as well.

**Port Wander:** For those venturing towards the Halo Stars, Port Wander is often the last stop before leaving the sector and a welcome harbour should they return. It orbits an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant beyond the Drusus Marches, and provides basic facilities for everything from Rogue Traders to small Void Jumpers in the area. Somewhat of a frontier station, it is popular with many a vessel (and crew) of dubious legality.

#### **Travelling in Space**

Imperial vessels rely on two kinds of drives which make space travel possible; warp engines which allow for passage between the stars through the nightmare realm of the Empyrean, and plasma drives which provide thrust and propel a ship through the cold void of realspace. All ships need the latter for mundane travel inside a star system, as operating warp engines too close to massive objects such as planets or stars can cause unforgivable results ranging from being tossed off course thousands of light years to outright implosion from warp rip-tides. Plasma drives are tough and reliable, and powerful enough to move a ship from one end of a system to the other in a reasonable amount of time. Heavy thrusters are used for planetary landings and take-off, as the huge amounts of hard radiation produced from a plasma drive are generally lethal for most environments. All of these drives reflect basic Imperial technology—powerful, blunt and unforgiving.

The mechanisms that enable space travel are often overlooked by the common sorts of citizenry of the Imperium, for a variety of systems mask the experiences one would expect from travelling through the void. One conspicuous absence is weightlessness—in fact, many people do not realise that they even should be floating about inside their tiny ships. Grav plating throughout the ship allows humanity to travel in a somewhat normal manner. Grav plates are mostly autonomous once activated, creating a pseudo-gravity field complete with inertial compensation. Most ships replicate one Holy Terra standard but a few customise to slightly more or less of that level. Like most Imperial technologies, the secrets of grav plate construction are now almost lost and thus even the smallest vessel (and its integrated plating) is a priceless artefact to be maintained and preserved for generations.

#### <span id="page-157-0"></span>**FamousVessels**

While the infamous Misericord is perhaps the most well known spacecraft in the sector, many other vessels ply the stars of Calixis and have made named for themselves.

*Angevin's Destiny***:** This ancient Imperial battleship is the flagship of Battlefleet Calixis and regarded as the saviour at the Battle of Markayn.

*Belasarro***:** A passenger transport ship plying the Drusus Marches, it has never missed a scheduled run in over 350 years.

*Calixius Esme***:** This Imperial destroyer is noted for leading fleets on successful punitive campaigns against Dust Raiders lurking in the Fydae System.

*Constant Measure***:** This cargo ship is famed for keeping systems beyond the Markayn Marches supported when warp storms threatened isolation. Millions of survivors named their offspring after the ship and crew in gratitude.

*Craneshank***:** A Free Charter merchant trader operating off the standard routes in the Maffaian sub-sector, it is known for accepting almost any hire (as long as the Thrones are golden).

*Faith Eternal***:** Principally a pilgrim ship that carries the faithful to (and sometimes from) Sentinel, it is distinguished by an apocryphal story claiming that its Geller field failed once in transit, but the righteous chanting of its passengers kept the ship protected until it could safely exit the immaterium.

*Halfhund***:** A light tramp freighter working the coreward archipelagos, it has garnered a reputation for both speed and discreteness, staying just on the coreward side of respectability.

*Krystyna***:** Noted for discovering the extinct Egerian Dominion, this Rogue Trader set off a rush to exploit the civilization's dead maze-cities for black market artefacts.

*Mirabelle***:** This famous high-end passenger liner offers pleasure cruises around the wondrously glowing Adrantis Nebula. *Path of Drusus***:** A pilgrim ship still tracing the saint's route made before his ascension. As the complete voyage lasts 147 years though, "reaching Scintilla" has become an oft-heard saying for a task unlikely to be finished.

**Drystan Construction Yards:** Though new naval vessels are exceedingly rare, the yards at Drystan still stay operational. Established soon after Saint Drusus took office, the yards slowly produce military ships, or more commonly work repairs on those extensively damaged. As it is near the spinward boarder, Yard-Admiral Nar'akot does some side business on vessels from there as well. This does lead to some interesting exchanges between naval personnel and "private" citizens, most taking place in the Yard's taverns and most cleaned up by the following morning.

**Kormisoshi Dockyards:** Many commercial construction and repair needs are served by the Kormisoshi Dockyards, more centrally located to the coreward of Tranch. Second only to rival Harluff Yards, Kormisoshi handles everything from Navigator Housefleet Primats and Chartist Greatholds to System Hoppers and Limpet Boats. Run by the Kormisoshi-Targ Corporation and operated by Hereditary Yardmaster Petronella Jansson, the station also does brisk business selling smaller ships whose captains could not finish paying for repair work.

**Diogenes IV Research Station:** One of many Adeptus Mechanicus installations scattered across the sector operated by the Lords of Mars. Tenuously (and dangerously) anchored in the centre of a pulsar cluster on the rimward border, its thousands of servitor-cogitators gather and digest data on this mysterious constellation. It receives little notice and few inquisitive visitors, which perfectly suits those running the station.

**41 Pry:** Tucked away from the regular trade routes, barely operational and mostly forgotten by respectable merchant fleets. Stations like 41 Pry serve a more disreputable clientele and are not places to venture into lightly. It is best to keep one hand on your pistol and the other on your geltbag.

For every base still in operation, though, there are multitudes of abandoned or derelict stations scattered across the void, each home to pirates or worse. Sabriel is one such facility, a forgotten outpost in the Periphery. Averick Rox, a somewhat successful smuggler, rediscovered the station by accident decades ago and began using it as a base of operations. Since then it has grown and now caters to a wide assortment of crews, ranging from the morally flexible to the downright illegal.

#### **Common Merchant & Commercial Vessels**  Common Merchant & Commercial Vessels

Broadly speaking, the non-military vessels of the sector are transports. Some only haul cargo, others only passengers, but most carry a mix of the two. All legitimate craft operate under an Imperial charter, granting them the right to fly lawfully between stars. Some charters allow only for travel along specific routes, while others allow for travel anywhere. Many charters date back thousands of years and it is a rare thing for a new charter to be granted. Most vessels operate in fleets, the better to protect each other from raiders (and rival merchants) as well as facilitate cargo loading and unloading.

As in most sectors, Chartist captains dominate the stars of Calixis. Operating without Navigators or Astropaths (luxuries normally affordable only to the military or planetary governments), they rely on carefully maintained star charts to make journeys from point to point. Some of these maps cover paths of relative safety for warp travel and must be followed precisely. This often means extremely circuitous routes, such that a linear path of tens of light years might entail dozens of jumps totalling hundreds of light years of travel. But for some systems, such a route is the only way possible. Often these planets may go generations without a visit if they are especially distant.

#### **Space Hulks**

Given the unforgiving currents and eddies moving through the immaterium, vessels can sometimes become ripped from their planned course and forever gripped by warp tides. Some eventually translate back into realspace far from their scheduled location or time, but most are doomed to wander the galaxy at random. As other ships become trapped by similar currents they are forcibly rammed together (or worse fused together as they emerge back into realspace), forming impossibly large conglomerations. These hulks can hold lost technology dating back to times before the Imperium was founded or even materials from xenos crafts. When a hulk appears it sets off a mad scramble to plunder it before it vanishes back into the warp. Each appears as a ghost ship, derelict of crew and easy pickings. However, they are far from empty, often containing entombed scavengers or xenos races using hulks as crude transports. Hosts of predatory and aggressive creatures can lurk within, waiting for others to venture inside. The fact that most relic hunters are well aware of these dangers serves to illustrate how valuable any discoveries that might be onboard can be.

#### **Bulk Cargo Transports**

Of the Chartist ships, bulk cargo transports are the most numerous. In Calixis space, Greatholds are the largest, dwarfing all but gargantuan vessels such as Emperor-class battleships or unique monstrosities like the *Misericord*. Each Greathold can carry enough goods such that offloading takes dozens of months. Almost as large are the Excolati refinery ships which take this a step further and actively process raw materials during the trip, so products such as weapons-grade promethium are ready to deliver on arrival.

When one of these huge vessels arrives at a planet, it is an occasion noted all over the system. While the Misericord is infamous for the bad luck it brings, other arrivals are a cause of celebration and holidays as it means badly needed medicines and foodstuffs as well as new toys and diversions for the local rulers. As the saying goes, when the Governor is happy, everyone else eats better.

#### **Transports**

There is a limited demand for pure passenger ships, as most travellers make do with transport ship accommodations. For those who can afford it though, there are several options for connecting the more populous and powerful systems for the nobility and corporate lords. Pilgrim Ships are the more common type, dedicated to taking the faithful to and from planets of spiritual note or allowing them to retrace the steps of the favoured saints.

Mixed passenger and cargo transports are the most common type to be found, primarily carrying one while also providing limited space for the other. Sizes range widely, but most are medium level crafts that can service most of the sector depending on their charter type. Short-range system Hoppers and Void Jumpers for example usually operate under low-level Hereditary Charters. They work short-range trading routes between nearby systems, normally only making one or two jumps to reach their destination. Smaller tramp freighters are also widespread, working without regular routes and barely surviving from one job to the next. For Imperial agents, especially those wishing a low profile, these types of ships can be a common means of transportation throughout Calixis.

#### **Other Vessels**

While not actual ships, most systems host a variety of other space-born facilities. These include orbiting centres such as planetary monitors and docks, beacon stations, emergency lifehouses and more. Some are as large as small moons and act as the major nexuses of commerce and shipping for a system, while others may be little more than a refitted cargo hold conducting research on the fringes of the system.

#### **System Ships**

System ships are just that: lacking warp engines they operate within the system using plasma drives alone. A civilized system might have hundreds working to move cargo and people throughout its space, while lower level planets may only have a handful to support larger transports on their arrival. Most captains look down on these vessels, but they are vital in systems with multiple inhabited planets or stations.

#### **Ship Quality**

The standard vessel is of Common craftsmanship. There may be a few failed grav plates and the air may smell a bit, with occasional problems to make the passage interesting in ways not imagined (or desired) by the passengers. Overall, they are fairly dependable and reliable. To create ships of differing standards, use the following modifications:

**Poor:** The ship is barely able to hold atmosphere, with minor hull leaks and plasma drive failures a common occurrence. Much of the ship resembles a junkyard, patched together with random parts and purity seals. It would be wise to sleep with one eye open and a ready pistol when travelling. Expect a true adventure during the passage; you are bound to pick up a few stories to tell at the next bar should you ever arrive.

**Good:** A step above the standard, with wellmaintained decks and regular prayer sessions to maintain the spiritual wellbeing of the ship and its crew. There might be some problems during the voyage, but usually none that are too life threatening.

**Best:** A trip of relaxed calm awaits, as if the Emperor Himself was watching over you. If it weren't for your upcoming mission and the high cost of the passage, you would probably never depart.

<span id="page-159-0"></span>Limpet Boats are small craft carried onboard Greatholds or other gargantuan ships, and are designed to detach once the main craft has reached its destination. Limpets then scurry about transporting cargo, shuttling crew and passengers, and performing other necessary tasks to ensure that the parent ship will be ready for its next journey.

Shuttles and Lighters are another common craft, working only between their home planet and any orbiting vessels. When a new ship arrives to their planet, they blast into space vying for any work to be had. These boats are also useful for fast (but expensive) planetside transport as well.

And then there are the Rogue Traders. Each as eclectic and unique as their master, they can range from one vessel to many. Rogue Traders operate almost as a law unto themselves; with no boundaries except those proscribed in their charter, they roam the edges of the galaxy in search of new worlds to exploit.

#### **Catching <sup>a</sup> Ride**

Unless you have access to a dedicated vehicle (perhaps your Inquisitor has a permanent arrangement with a Chartist captain, or even owns his own ship), you will need to manage your own travel arrangements. Most of the time this is a relatively straightforward affair as most planetary docks have procedures to arrange berths on passenger ships. Most transport captains are also willing to take on some passengers and indicate their destinations and rates at the docks as well. If you're in need of transportation to a location not listed, though, or need arrangements outside the norm (such as expeditious speed, possibly illegal cargo or travel to forbidden worlds) then some serious negotiations will be needed. Having plenty of Thrones or bartering merchandise on your person can aid this process immeasurably.

Most Inquisitorial agents refrain from simply commandeering a vessel on the authority of their rosette, and save that as a last resort to be used only when regular means such as payment, bribery and subtle threats fail. Keeping the negotiations "sub-rosa" helps maintain good working relations with the merchant fleets and helps ensure that the next time you need a ride things go smoothly. It also helps keep them in business and available for you in future endeavours. Indeed, if you treat them well, most captains look forward to your repeat business, thus making life easier for all parties concerned.

#### **Availability for Finding a Ship** Availability for Finding a Ship

Finding passage can sometimes be a troublesome experience, depending on the type of ship you're looking for. Use Table 5-4: Finding a Ship to determine passage Availability and standard costs.

#### **Passage in Space** Passage in Space

Once you have secured passage, there are two main types of service that can affect your voyage: your accommodations and the meals provided. Obviously things can vary from ship to ship, so GMs should feel free to improvise and create new prices and offerings as desired to ensure a memorable crossing for their Acolytes. The information below can be used as a guide in setting these rates. Bon Voyage!

B**erthing:** This covers all manner of lodgings to be found on a ship, from the barely liveable to the sumptuously extravagant.

**Shipboard Meals:** This includes any kind of consumables such as foodstuffs and beverages to be considered part of your passage fee. Travellers can bring their own foodstuffs or rations if they desire, but have to pay extra for the additional cargo space.

The cost of a service, given in Thrones, indicates only a single overnight accommodation or a single meal. GMs should modify these rates depending on such things as travel through dangerous regions (battle zones, quarantined areas) and journeys longer than the vessel normally takes.

### <span id="page-160-0"></span>Ranged Weapons Rang ed Weapons

*"All hands, brace for impact. Armsmen to decks three and four to repel boarders. Passengers will please remain in their quarters for the duration of this unscheduled event. That is all."*

— Avery Tokkle, Captain, Astrella Adrantis.

While somewhat rarer than on land, open combat does take place even on spacecraft travelling through the void. Whether repelling borders, putting down an indentured underclass uprising, or fighting off attacks from the "nightmare holds", crewmen face a barrage of enemies and thus need weapons. Many of these are regular weapons used elsewhere in the Imperium. Most, however, can easily puncture hull plating as they would a body, leaving fighters on both sides to "kiss the void", as common parlance goes. W Flame Weapons

To prevent this, a well-equipped vessel maintains stocks of weapons designed for the safety of the ship as well as combat. These generally feature a much lower penetrating strike to prevent accidental breaches. Several are deliberately designed to be less lethal, as they are often used to force recalcitrant deckhands to return to work. As fighting can take place in claustrophobic corridors with little or no time before faceto-face conflict ensues, most are also heavily reinforced and weighted so they can double as a club as well. Range is never a serious factor, as only the most massive of ships have long open spaces of any note.

Often these weapons can be procured on trading stations or dockyards, where down-on-their-luck spacers barter their possessions for repair gelt or to cover gambling debts. They are fairly common in backwater weaponshops or dealerships as well. It's also possible to trade or barter for them while travelling, especially on low-grade transports with laxer standards. In any case, if an Acolyte plans on extensive space travelling, having weapons designed for fighting in these conditions is worth serious consideration.

#### **Flame Weapons Anoxis Burst Pattern Flamer**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

Also known (very informally) as "Hax's Breath", this flamer variant weapon shoots a quick pulse of fire designed more to frighten and repel than seriously injure. Unlike regular flame weapons, they do not spray a promethium stream so the targets are not smothered with flammable liquid. Unless hit at point-blank range, targets instead receive a burst of heat that may singe eyebrows or ignite loose clothing, but do not suffer any significant burns.

#### **Anoxis Pattern "Stingray" Rifle**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

Stingrays emit a powerful microwave beam in a wide arc. The radiation causes immediate blistering heat on exposed skin (similar to a powerful insect sting, thus giving its name) with no danger of harming most other objects. Stingrays are ideal weapons for when crewmen need to repel unruly crew (or passengers). Even though a Stingray rifle has the Flame special quality it cannot set things on fire.

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons Cypra Mundi "Ironclaw" Shotgun** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

These standard shipboard weapons are designed to resist the rigors of the void and have a reinforced, weighted stock, which can double as a club (1d10–2+SB I) if needed. Storage lockers filled with Ironclaws are commonplace on military vessels and unlock automatically to arm the crew when the signal is given to repel boarders.

#### **Cypra Mundi "Irontalon" Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

A favoured naval officer's sidearm in the Segmentum Obscurus, it uses special fragmenting ammunition designed to violently stop a target dead in its tracks without undue risk to a ship's hull. The pistol itself is also very sturdy and designed to be used as a cudgel in emergences (treat as a club). Most are engraved with their issuing vessel's mark, making those from famous warships extremely valuable to wealthy collectors. The Irontalon's specialised fragmenting ammunition is itself classed as Rare and valued at 30 thrones per clip on the black market (and may only be used with this pistol). Normal auto-rounds may be used if desired but if this is the case the Tearing and Primitive qualities do not apply to the damage.

#### **Naval Shotcannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (SP)

Shotcannons can lay waste to hordes of attackers in the confined spaces of a shipboard action and a close-range hit from one can literally explode a man into a spray of shredded clothing and flesh. These huge weapons generate a fearsome recoil when fired and must be securely mounted or fired from a braced position to be effectively used (-30 to hit otherwise).

#### **Shotgun Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Compact single shot hand cannon, designed to fire shotgun cartridges. These weapons are often the preferred sidearm of petty officers and bosuns who carry them to discourage any thoughts of mutiny, earning the

weapon the nickname of "persuaders" in Naval slang. Due to their recoil, they impose a –10 penalty to hit if fired one-handed.

**"You are not free whose liberty is won by the rigour of other, more righteous souls. You are merely protected. Your freedom is parasitic, you suck the honourable man dry and offer nothing in return. You who have enjoyed freedom, who have done nothing to earn it, your time has come. This time you will stand alone and fight for yourselves. Now you will pay for your freedom in the currency of honest toil and human blood."**

## <span id="page-162-0"></span>Melee Weapons Me lee Weapons

As with ranged weapons, melee weapons are designed for versatility and use in tight places.

#### **Armoured Gauntlets**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Originally designed as protection when handling overheated conduit pipes or plasma coils, many armsmen have adapted them into melee weapons. The padded exteriors are stripped away and extra metal riveting is added, sometimes with spikes or other adornments to increase the force of each blow.

#### **Bulkhead Cutters**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Bulkhead Cutter)

As the name suggests, these are designed to rip open tough metal bulkheads and deck plating. They consist of an elaborate harness with a huge row of mechanical teeth running along the forearm and extending roughly 30 centimetres outwards. Often a torso support is also worn to make operating this heavy and cumbersome device easier for extended durations. As one can imagine, they can serve as intimidating combat weapons as well.

#### **Chimera Pistol Sword**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive) and Pistol (SP)

As many shipboard combats move from shooting to personal combat very quickly, it is common for many ranged weapons to also serve in close combat. Others take this approach in the opposite direction, and add a single-shot firearm to their sword. While the firearm can vary from person to person, most have the same range and effect as a standard Irontalon. This augmentation is often disguised as an ornate part of the sword or axe hilt, allowing the user to catch the enemy by surprise.

**Chimera Pistol Sword**

#### **Kraken Tooth Dagger**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Legends abound of gargantuan creatures hiding on the edges of system space, ready to attack vessels just as they emerge from the warp. Whilst no concrete evidence exists, huge pearlescent teeth have been fashioned into gleaming knives by many void born, who will only say that they were recovered from debris found in the void. Some are decorated with intricate scrimshaw carvings depicting horrendous beasts tearing apart ships, oddly enough making such daggers good luck charms.

#### **Man-Catcher**

**Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A long two-handed pole with a huge spring-loaded claw at the end, it is primarily used to corral mutineers. When the pole strikes an enemy the claws snap shut, trapping the foe in a harsh metal grip, which depending on the body part caught could ensnare, injure or even kill.

#### **Naval Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Naval armsmen often carry one of these, to protect them as they protect their vessel. Each shield is a huge solid plate of plasteel, rectangular and heavy. Unlike most Imperial shields they are flat and smooth surfaced, so that they can also be used as emergency hull or bulkhead sealers. A Naval shield can be used as cover, concealing the user completely if desired.

As cover a Naval shield provides 8 Armour Points.

#### **Neural Whip**

#### **Class:** Melee (Shock)

An advanced version of a regular whip, a neural whip can stun or kill outright through the massive electrical surges they impart as their long metallic lashes hit flesh. At low settings they are often used to "encourage" workers or ratings to increase their enthusiasm, whilst higher settings can drop an enemy dead in a single strike. Even unpowered, each blow from the whip lacerates bare flesh. Though it is not a thrown weapon, a neural whip has a longer range than most melee weapons and is able to strike foes up to three metres away.

#### **Officer's Cutlass**

#### **Class:** Melee (Shock)

The officer's cutlass is a standard variation on the basic cutlass sword and it sees use in almost every vessel in the sector. In close-quarters fighting, the heavy metal guard is often used as an offensive weapon in its own right as the armoured shell can provide a powerful punch. Many ship's officers and ratings heighten this effect by incorporating a shock generator in the guard, so that, when hit, an opponent is felled by both the electrical shock as well as the solid impact. Chartist captains and other higher rankings use even more lethal versions, strengthening their blades with power fields. The statistics shown on Table 5-7: Void Melee Weapons is for the Shock version.

#### **Shock - Staff**

**Class:** Melee (Shock)

A variant of the standard shock maul, it is made of a simple length of metal or plasteel with a single-setting shock emitter built into the far end. The shock-staff is mostly used in herding indentured workers pressed into service on the ship.

#### **Short Sword**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

As decks can be too cramped to effectively wield a normal sword, these shortened versions are popular with boarding parties and armsmen. Longer than a combat knife, but not by much, they are heavy and brutal weapons designed to stab rather than strike and most have wide flat blades which can be used for incapacitating side strikes.

#### **Anoxis Pattern Boarding Pike**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

One problem with most powerful close combat weapons is that they can easily punch through hull plating. Boarding pikes are a common shipboard solution, using a shell charge mounted at the end of a reinforced short metal staff. A trigger in the grip activates the charge to explode on contact. The explosion blasts into flesh with gruesome effect, but with little or no collateral damage to hull plating. It takes some time to reload, so it is used as a one-shot weapon and then acts as a club for the remainder of a combat.

<span id="page-164-0"></span>This section includes an assortment of miscellaneous gear including special forms of ammunition, armour and other gear useful for navigating the perils of the warp.

#### **Blazer Shells Ignitius Shotgun Shells**

These shells are packed with pyrotechnic materials, so when fired a huge gout of flame is produced for several seconds. While not as lethal as regular rounds, a volley excels at frightening off most

enemies. As they can also be used in standard shotguns, they offer excellent tactical flexibility without the need for specialised flamer weapons. The duration of the discharge means it can only be used in single-shot mode.

Blazer shotgun shells may be used with any shotgun and, when fired, reduce the weapon's Range to 15 metres unless that would be greater than its actual Range. In addition, they change the weapon's Damage type to Energy (E) and give it the Flame and Primitive qualities.

#### **Boarding Armour**

When conducting offensive actions or repelling enemy boarders, Naval armsmen often don these armoured kits. Each is a full flak suit, with carapace plating only on the front and a full helmet with faceplate and respirator. Designs can vary from ship to ship, but the overall suit is of common usage in the armed merchant vessels of the sector.

Boarding armour covers all locations providing 3 Armour Points of flak armour to the Legs and Arms and 5 Armour Points of carapace armour to the Head and Body. The armour also comes with a built-in Void Suit and photo-visor.

#### **Emergency Kits**

Most ships have emergency kits scattered about, and crewmen often carry around smaller versions. A full kit can include all of the following items:

**Glowstick:** Good for 1d5 hours of steady illumination. Universal Power Cell: Using either integral plugs or adaptor leads, it can power a glowstick or emergency vox for 1d5 hours or a laspistol for 5 shots.

**Ration pack and water canister:** Not much, but it will keep you from starving for an extra day. Hopefully your air is lasting that long.

**Emergency Vox:** Adjustable for any of the shipboard comm frequencies or can broadcast a standard "Prayer for Aid" on emergency channels.

**Air bottle and Mask:** Will keep you breathing for about 30 minutes.

**Anti-radiation Tabs:** Good for what ails you, if you've been exposed to hard radiation. The kit includes five tablets, each staving off the effects of exposure to such things as plasma engines or solar flares.

**Hull Sealant Spray-Gel:** A small tube of foul-smelling gel, it can be sprayed onto a hull breach. Enough is in each tube to cover twenty or so small (10 sq. cm) punctures.

Be wary of any ship where you see most of the crew carrying a full kit all of the time, or where these kits cannot be located.

#### **Jump Pack**

Personal flight and anti-grav devices are something of a rarity in the Imperium, however, far from unknown. Jump packs are one such system, allowing limited powered flight using a combination of suspensor systems and thrusters. Jump packs are commonly employed by elite forces such as the Adeptus Sororitias Seraphim and the Imperial Navy's void armsmen, while a much more powerful version is also used by Space Marine assault forces.

Jump packs require the operator to have the Pilot (Jump Pack) skill. A standard (basic) jump pack allows for a safe, guided fall from any height and, with a thruster boost, make an unlimited series of short jumps (landing at the end of each Round's movement), or they can duplicate the Flyer (12) trait for up to about a minute at a time. A jump pack's power supply will last for about an hour of strenuous operation before it needs replacing.

#### **Magboots**

Heavy and bulky, these oversized shoes contain electromagnets, which when activated, means the user can adhere to metallic surfaces such as exterior hull plating. Walking in them takes some effort, but they allow for a much easier time when working outside a ship or in areas where grav plating has failed. Magboots reduce the wearer's Movement and AB by half (round up) but allow him to move about normally in areas of low or no gravity as long as there is a suitable surface to walk on.

#### **The Imperial Navy in Sector Calixis**

Operating throughout the sector is the might of the Imperial Navy, but even with their multitude of warships, they are stretched thinly. Despite any full scale battles underway, there are always smaller outbreaks that must be contained, especially when a renegade governor attempts to declare independence and cordon off his planet or system. The predations of xenos raiders tax their resources with hit-and-run engagements as well.

In addition to its actions in ship combat, the Navy is also responsible for transporting Imperial Guard regiments to war zones. If a commercial fleet is important enough (or has the right connections at the Lucid Palace) then Naval vessels can be assigned escort duty, especially if a trade route has been heavily hit by pirates.

Battlefleet Calixis is the largest and most powerful fleet in the sector, but is rarely brought together as a single force. More often it is split up to meet demands as they arise.

#### **Melta Gel**

This term covers a wide variety of extruded gelatine similar to dental paste, usually bright red or some other strong colour and sticky enough to adhere to most surfaces. Once applied and activated by an electric spark, it rapidly burns through bulkhead plating without the need for oxygen. Ideal for opening up a spacecraft from the outside or working in areas where air has escaped, most repair crews carry several tubes in their kits. A tube of melta gel can cover five metres in a thin line, or a surface area of one metre square. Along this line or area it deals Damage as a melta bomb over the course of about a minute as it burns through whatever it is applied to before becoming inert.

1kg

#### **Ploin Juice**

A common non-alcoholic beverage popular with many ship's crews as it combats many common illnesses brought on by the habitual poor diets most find in space travel. Made from the lopsided ploin fruit, it is rich in many vitamins and has an extended shelf life. It can be added to most poor quality distillations to add much-needed flavour, or even used as the basis for its own strong drink commonly known as "wobble" (as this is both what the fruit does when set upright, and what most users do after imbibing a few shots).

#### **Selenite Pattern Heavy Duty**

#### **Void Suit**

A truly ancient design and a relic of the sacred STC, the Selenite pattern is perhaps the most common heavy void suit used in the Imperium. Intended for use by voidwalkers, belt miners and the like, the suit's insulated ceramic-fibre weave provides much better protection than a simple sealed suit from the hazards of space such as temperature extremes, radiation and micro-fragment impact. Widely fabricated and hugely durable, some Selenite suits are treasured relics of the void born families and star vessels, and may have served many generations in a particular ship's crew.

The Selenite can sustain life in hard vacuum for up to ten hours before the dual re-breather cells of its life support system must be replaced (which may even be done without removing the suit). A fully functioning suit in good order also contains an internal vox-link, a seal patching kit, a compact grapnel/clasp plus ten metres of line, and a photo-visor. The suit's reinforced structure provides 3 Armour Points to the Body, Arms and Legs and 4 Armour Points from the helmet to the Head. The suit however is quite bulky and imposes a –10 penalty on all Agility Tests whilst worn. Selenite suits appear in several local variants and are subject to the rules for Armour Quality.

Some Selenite suits are fitted with impellor units, allowing the wearer to propel themselves through open space in zero or reduced gravity conditions with a Movement of 6 (they are not powerful enough to use in a normal gravity environment, however).

#### **Void Rounds**

Specialised void rounds can be created by using selfigniting chemicals such that the weapon can be used in void environments without the risk of misfiring or rapid overheating.

Weapons using void rounds gain the Reliable quality in void conditions.

**Available For:** SP weapons (all).

The Black Holds

*"Lieutenant Weems, inform the cogboys the power is still out in section 52. Still no sign of the repair team. Sir, can we confirm this was their last location? Lads, watch your footing, grav plating seems low. Opening shaft 52-Beta now… hey, what's that?"*

— Recorded Vox Transmission, Ensign Patel Carolis,

Chartist vessel *Steadfast Faith*.

<span id="page-166-0"></span>As with many Imperial artefacts, most spacecraft have lifespans measured in dozens of centuries or longer. This is especially true for the truly gigantic vessels such as Chartist Greatholds or Naval capital ships. As generations pass, even regular repair and watchful maintenance leave some areas falling into disuse as decks become sealed off and entire subsections are abandoned. They become a dark home to the unwanted and forgotten, renegades and runaways. These are the "nightmare holds", the black decks only whispered of throughout the many fleets in the sector but known to all that make their lives in the void. The Black Holds

In these miserable places entire biospheres have formed, despite lack of power, fresh air or even reliable footing where grav plating has failed. Flickering lights barely illuminate the dank and toxic environs where fungus and beasts thrive amidst the chemical and radioactive sludge. Unknown numbers of what were once men also congregate here to survive. Even mediumsized ships contain hundreds if not thousands of indentured workers and others pressed into service, and escaping from their A

oppression is a constant goal. Once free, though, many wish they stayed in the dregs of their prior station. Other habitants can include fleeing criminals, newly emerging mutants and renegades. After years in the holds, most devolve into barely human dregs as the hostile atmosphere twists them unkindly. Now they lurk as bilge-scum, flesh eating hold-gaunts and other unholy creatures, attacking any who venture into their lairs. When desperate enough they venture topsides in search of food, and woe unto anyone they find.

#### **Gear of the Bilge-Scum**

In these conditions, it is rare for regular weapons to be common, as lack of ammunition quickly becomes an issue. Instead most are crafted from the debris littered throughout the black decks, creating a wide range of primitive weapons often made of high-tech materials. Crude swords, axes and shields are the most common. While simplistic in design, they can be just as deadly as the more advanced weapons these creatures face in combat.

#### <span id="page-167-0"></span>**Ghiliam**

Whether outcast, victim or fugitive, to join the Ghiliam (as the void born call them) is to leave humanity forever, descending to depths from which there is no return. Haunting the dark spaces and abandoned holds of great vessels, these debased, insane mutants and carrion eaters subsist on whatever meat they can find and aren't too picky as to how they get it. Treated as dangerous and clever vermin, they are exterminated mercilessly where possible.

| Ghiliam Profile |    |    |    |    |     |     |      |    |

**Threat Rating:** Hereticus Minima.

#### **Bilge Grenade**

These are generally crude bombs containing a mix of poisonous fungi, chemical waste, and diseased flesh. The canisters burst open on impact, showering the area with caustic sludge and noxious vapours. While their effect is not very powerful, unprotected targets can be brought down by the toxins, if not by the sheer nauseating smell of the attack. Bilge grenades count as frag grenades with the Unreliable and Toxic qualities. Gear of the Bilge Scum

#### **Lumenmould**

This phosphorescent fungus provides reliable lighting for most of the Black Holds, where it thrives in the toxic sludge lining most decks. By scraping the mould and sludge into clear containers, crude light sources can be created to offer this greenish-yellow glow in areas without other sources of illumination. Others simply use the slime as body paint, making their already unsettling forms even more terrifying. A patch of lumenmould lights an area dimly for five metres.

### **Crime in the Void**

Despite its reputation as one of the more civilized sectors in the segmentum, Calixis does support a thriving underclass

V: Frontier Worlds & The Void

of criminal activity. The mostly uncharted Halo Stars host numerous pirate bands for example, but most illegal interstellar activities riddle the sector's interior like worms in an apple.

Petty smuggling is the most common of these as even the most loyal of captains may haul some extra unregistered goods at a tidy profit. Almost every transport ship, especially short-range models, has concealed cargo spaces just for this purpose. Crime in the Void

Merchant vessels operating without the proper charter for their area or trade route do so at peril, both from the Navy as well as rival Chartist fleets who swiftly act to destroy any competitors. They are welcomed in some systems though as a way to bypass the frequently oppressive monopolies maintained by some Chartist traders.

Then there are clear-cut smuggling outfits, often using counterfeit licenses to move merchandise from system to system. Some of these also transport people fleeing the Emperor's Law, no questions asked. Largescale smuggling operations normally use rendezvous locations on the periphery of a system to do business, far from watchful eyes. Smaller system ships then ferry the goods to waiting purchasers.

Some areas of space are off-limits except only to those operating with Imperial sanction. These can be areas such as unexplored systems licensed exclusively to Rogue Traders, or quarantine zones of xenos activity. Operating in such an area without remit is highly illegal, but can often lead to incredible profits that are well worth the risk. Blockade runners operate these areas, relying on stealth and speed to escape capture as they dart in and out of forbidden space with prohibited cargo.

# Navis Nobilite & Navigators

Like any other civilized sector of Imperial space, Calixis has several families of the Navis Nobilite operating to ensure spacecraft can successfully travel long distances through the void. There are three major Navigator Houses in the sector: Houses Banetek, Gazmati and Term'L. All three have major holdings on Scintilla in Hive Sibellus as well as Hive Tarsus. As with most Navigator Houses, there are fierce rivalries between each of them and they are constantly struggling for dominance. Banetek and Gazmati have operated in Calixis the longest, being part of the initial explorations and conquests lead by Lord Angevin long ago, with Term'L more recently extending into this sector.

Each house operates a sizable fleet with a large mercantile division under Hereditary Charters. They conduct standard trading throughout the sector as well as providing specialised transport for their own house members. Many of their vessels are ancient even by Imperial standards, passed down through many generations of these longlived beings. They also control many of the prime trading routes in the sector.

*"Right you lot, I'm to brief you on war zone etiquette—so listen up! It's real simple… Do what you're told, keep your weapon clean and your head down. Oh, and don't touch nothing."*

— Sergeant "Brassneck" Hobbs, Scintillian 23rd.

I f there is one unifying thread that binds the Imperium together throughout its millennia of existence, it is war. The Imperium was built and is sustained through bloody crusades and eternal conflict, and the Calixis Sector is no exception. Despite its reputation as a civilized though remote sector, Calixis too has its share of combat zones. To travel through the sector is to see numerous conflicts, ranging from the small-scale skirmishes of rebellious workers and factions to planetwide carnage caused by xenos incursion or infection. The Hammer of the Emperor, as His Imperial Guard forces are commonly called, is indeed an apt name as the warfare practiced by Imperial forces is as brutal and unforgiving as a hammer strike to the face. I

Many conflicts are but brief flashes measured in days or months, others can last for decades or longer. Ignorance is a virtue, with the most conflicts going unknown to the toiling multitudes of the sector, their knowledge limited to rousing propaganda and scant rumour brought back by battle-weary troopers whose dreams are the endless nightmares of men who have seen too much.

#### **Arming for Battle** Arming for Battle

The Departmento Munitorum is, among other things, responsible for providing munitions, war machines, armaments and other support material vital to maintain Imperial Guard forces and their ability to prosecute war. This vast logistical enterprise stretches across the Imperium, and without it the Hammer of the Emperor would simply fall apart. In the Calixis Sector, the Munitorum's headquarters can be found on Scintilla, where legions of administrata cogitate and sequester contracts and orders with forge worlds, fanes and hives to supply their needs, thus ensuring the continued security of Calixis space.

#### **Munitorum Standard**

As the Departmento Munitorum is the largest weapons production and procurement agency in the galaxy, it is no wonder that their products have become the standard for the Imperium. Whilst there are countless variations of the basic lasgun for example, almost all function in a fairly common manner with the standard nineteen-megathule power pack. Without such standardisation the Imperial Guard could not effectively fight across the wide expanse of Imperial space. Weapons as described in the Dark Heresy core rulebook are for the most part examples of this Munitorum standard, and exist in great numbers; there are thousands of variant patterns used as well by Guardsmen and other Imperial agents of course. Many of these are captured combat trophies, unauthorised battlefield modifications, or weapons from the hives where such near-endless customisations abound. Usually it is up to each Guardsman to procure nonstandard ammunitions, either through battlefield scrounging or side dealings with Munitorum field officials. Such extra work is usually a fair trade, as, for most, having such a weapon is what differentiates the veteran trooper from a dead one.

#### <span id="page-171-0"></span>**A Sector at War**

Like almost all sectors of the Imperium, the Calixis Sector is home to war, with dozens of planets and systems at any given time seeing armed conflict. Below are just a few of the more notable actions within the sector.

Fydae has long been a troublesome system, and ongoing skirmishes have been running on and off for nearly 200 years against disparate pirate clans whose strongholds move as swiftly as do their vessels. All of the habitable planets in the region have been witness to scenes of open combat, with Imperial Guard regiments supplementing local Planetary Defence Forces in an attempt to pin down some of the larger and more cavalier pirate factions.

47 Kapella within the Kapella System, near the Blackshine Nebula, is in the process of Imperial pacification as Imperial Guard regiments from the Secundus 21st Expeditionary Force and Brontian 5th (Longknives) slowly complete mopping up operations against a civilian insurrection that overtook most of the planetary government, killing Lord Belin XVIII and virtually all of the leadership. The tattered and blackened remnants of Vunox are scant reminders of the once acclaimed spires of the hive.

A normally quiet and productive system spinward of the Markayn Marches, Gelmiro's main tithe planets are now desolate wastelands, the home of abominable mutations and crazed zealots. An uprising, lead by heretical followers of the insane cleric Anolian Hesh, ignited stolen atomics on Gelmiro Primus, Gelmiro Secundus and Tertius destroying nearly all of the system's key military assets. Investigating forces were greeted with attacks from planetary defences and traitor naval ships, and it was only after intense orbital battles that land forces could be deployed. Now in its third year, the effort to suppress those responsible has stagnated into a slogging battle of trench warfare. Imperial authorities continue to investigate how Hesh's followers managed to bring an entire system down.

The Purge of Avitohol will be a black mark in Calixis's history, with mile-high plumes of flame and smoke still rising daily over the ruined promethium refineries of that world situated in the Periphery. Elements of the Tranch 14th have been assigned to track down and eliminate an undisclosed xenos presence in the area.

Lastly there is the mystery of Tsade II. Located in the Josian Reach, Tsade II is an agri-world whose tithe includes sheef-corn (a staple ingredient for many foodstuffs processed to feed the hives of Fenksworld). The first indication of something amiss came when tithe-collection vessels, on their never-ending circuit of the system, approached only to be met with vox silence. The collectors found the planet reduced to craters and rubble, and space-based facilities torn to pieces. The few survivors could only gibber of "lights in the sky" and became violent when brought out of their underground bunkers. That an attack of such magnitude and speed could occur is disquieting to say the least and elements of Battlefleet Calixis have been despatched to investigate.

The following weapons see the heaviest use on the front lines of the Imperium.

#### **Bolt Weapons Garm Pattern Service Bolt Pistol** Bolt Weapons

#### **Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

Often brandished by Commissars, these large and intimidating weapons are designed to be carried unholstered and in easy sight of their charges. All Guardsmen, regardless of rank, know that their Commissar is watching their actions and is ready to grant summary execution to those found wanting in the Emperor's eyes. Service pistols are a constant reminder of what awaits them if they fail in their duty.

#### **Mars Pattern MarkII Scourge**

#### **Boltgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Bolt)

Favoured by the warrior-sisters of the Order of the Ebon Chalice at the Abbey of Dawn on Iocanthos, the Scourge comes equipped with a sarissa as the bayonet fixture. The sharp spiked attachment can easily rip open any heretic in the hands of a power-armoured Adepta Sororitas fighter. When used in close combat, a Mars Pattern boltgun counts as a monoaxe.

#### **Flamer Weapons Heavy Flamer** Flamer Weapons

#### **Class:** Heavy (Flamer)

Large and heavy, these weapons require a crew of two men, one to aim and carry the barrel, and the other saddled with the delightful job of having a large tank of promethium strapped to their back. Heavy Flamers are ideal for immolating entire swaths of enemy with each shot, and serve as an effective terror weapon.

#### **Voss Pattern Nightfire Flamer Class:** Basic (Flamer)

Purely a terror weapon, the Nightfire uses refined promethium blended with toxic chemicals. Used only by specialist assault troops in full protective gear, it not only burns but also poisons the surrounding air with noxious smoke. Foes who manage to survive the initial flames find themselves gasping for air once the toxins reach their lungs.

# **Las Weapons** Las Weapons**Voss Pattern**

*"Funniest thing I ever did see. Big guy comes a roaring over the trench waving this huge chain axe around. I get a quick shot, las in the belly, but he's sill standin'. He rears back to swing and the axe gets chunked up in the mud and flakboard. Stuck good, ain't comin' out. So he turns around to use both hands to try and haul it out. Still nothing. I'm starin' fit to bust waiting for the blow, till finally I get me' wits and pops him in the back of the head."*  — Trooper Gavin Calmor, 21st Artor Artillery Brigade.

#### **Triplex Pattern "Fury" Assault**

#### **Laspistol**

**Class:** Pistol (Las)

This rare variant is most often utilised by elite assault squads and the Fury is the ideal weapon when facing a horde of foes. They fire in short bursts, designed to clear away enemies without slowing the advance.

#### **Voss Pattern Hellgun and Hellpistol**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las) or Pistol (Las)

Utilising advanced techniques of manufacture and internal gyro-stabilisation, high power "hellguns" are the chosen weapons of the elite Inquisitorial Stormtroopers and Imperial Guard grenadier forces. Costly and difficult to manufacture, the primary source for these weapons in the Calixis Sector is the Takara Fane of Gunmetal City.

Hellguns are far more energy-hungry than standard las weapons and fed from power capacitor backpack units. They may use standard las weapon charge packs, but consume four charges per shot.

#### **Laslocks**

**Class:** Basic (Las)

Sometimes known as "blaze guns" or "las-muskets", no two of these cobbled together and ill-made weapons are ever quite the same. Often found in the hands of desperate and poorly equipped insurgents or renegades, las-locks are usually scratch built or modifications of antique or damaged las rifles brought back into service by scav-workshops and heretek forges. Laslocks's jury-rigged capacitors are temperamental things at best, but still potent, firing a more powerful discharge than that of a standard lasgun.

#### **Military Construction**

Common construction materials are used in most Imperial fortifications and military postings, mainly due to their simplicity of manufacture and the standardisation of fabrication technologies.

**Plasteel:** The strongest and most expensive, plasteel is used in both personal and vehicle armour. It is very durable, relatively lightweight, and can be formed into an endless variety of shapes and textures.

**Rockcrete:** Mostly made from native stone ground up and mixed with binding agents to form heavy, thick slabs used in walls and flooring. It is cheap and easy to create.

**Plascrete:** This material forms most prefabricated habs and Imperial stations. It combines the ease of manufacture of rockcrete with most of the durability of plasteel.

**Flakboard:** Used in many military installations, flakboard provides a quick means of protecting interior walls and repairing damage. It is sturdy and easy to construct, and can keep a fortification patched-up until more lasting materials can be procured.

**Proximity Alarm:** These detect motion and/or sound, and alert of incoming dangers such as ground-based attacks. Most set off a horrendous noise, but others can use silent or visual alerts linked to portable or emplaced receptor units.

**Razor Wire:** A decidedly crude yet effective way to protect an installation, razor wire sees extensive use in both war and urban zones.

#### **Weapons of the Astartes**

*"Look upon this with awe. This is a holy sword, given to us alone by the Emperor to declaim His will and bring the divine fire of retribution upon those who would forsake His word. Honour it daily within your prayers, for it is yours and yours alone."* — Boltgun Orientation, 5th Company Captain Vestanek.

The mighty Adepus Astartes are superhuman in every way, and so too are their weapons. Each is oversized, specially designed for their great strength and enlarged physiques. This is especially true of bolter weapons such as boltguns and bolt pistols. Massive and reinforced like their users, even the ammunition clips are sheathed in protective wards and armour, with hand-grips larger than any human hand can manage and a weight that would require most humans to use a support bracing. Indeed a human trying to fire such a weapon would likely suffer recoil of such strength that it would rip their arm from its socket. Space Marine boltguns are simply not something seen outside of their sacred ranks.

"Mortal" bolters are a rank apart and are so designed that mere humans can wield them. Designed with smaller grips and lighter construction, these bolters do not have the same capacity for slaughter as the Astartes versions, yet can easily cut a man in two. Supplied by the Departmento Munitorum to Imperial Guard forces throughout the galaxy, even these pale shadows of Marine bolters are rare trophies to be passed down from generation to generation.

#### **Mars Pattern Mark III Short Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Standard issue for many Imperial Guard regiments across the Imperium since M.36, the blocky MK III lasgun is a remarkably robust and easy to use weapon. Legendarily able to stand up to any amount of abuse and keep firing, the "Guardsman's Friend" as the Uplifting Primer calls it, is respected over more powerful shoulder arms for its practicality and extreme reliability in almost any condition. The Mars pattern is produced in great numbers on Scintilla and Malfi and is the standard armament of most Calixian Guard regiments.

#### **Mars Pattern Mark IV Command**

#### **Laspistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

Presented to officers when they attain company commands, these are high-powered weapons designed for carefully placed shots at longer ranges. They have an extended barrel and are slightly heavier than standard service pistols.

#### **Multi-Laser**

#### **Class:** Heavy (Las)

A vehicle-mounted weapon, commonly found on the Chimera APC and the Sentinel Wealker, a multilaser's rapid-pulse configuration allows a multitude of shots to be fired in bursts. While much less powerful than lascannon, they offer a high sustained rate of fire that makes them excellent as suppression and antipersonnel weapons.

#### **Roth Pattern Lightning Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

An unusual pattern, the Roth "Lightning" has its ammunition plug set behind the trigger grip, allowing for a extended collimation barrel which provides greater ranges without increasing the overall size. Owing to their relative rarity, these weapons are often restricted to "sharpshooter" light infantry regiments and many are further modified into long las sniper rifles.

#### **Stormfront Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

The use of this local variant of the standard Kantrael pattern lasgun by the widely renowned Brontian regiments has secured this weapon's "cold steel" reputation in Calixian military circles. The Stormfront lasgun features an integral bayonet and a wooden stock as part of its solid construction, and the rifle is balanced for the close-quarters fighting at which the Brontians excel. The Stormfront counts as a spear when used in melee.

#### **Lasburst Twin Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Considered old even among the ancient nature of most Imperial weapons, twin lasguns are a rare sight on the battlefield. First produced millennia ago, their design was never perfected as other patterns soon superseded the Lasburst's unreliable nature. Still some appear on battlefields, either as ancient devices or low-grade versions manufactured in lesser munitions factories. While not as dependable as a regular lasgun, Lasbursts offer a much stronger fire rate by literally doubling the normal firepower.

#### **Launchers Auxiliary Grenade Launcher** Launchers

#### **Class:** Basic (Launcher)

A small single-shot version of the regular grenade launcher fitted onto another ranged weapon such as a lasgun, allowing the user to either fire a single grenade instead of firing as normal. The added weight and cumbersome nature means that most users rarely bother to reload the launcher once it is expended. An auxiliary grenade launcher can be fitted to any basic weapon adding the weight as listed in its profile. A character using a weapon with an auxiliary grenade launcher can choose to either fire the launcher or the weapon it is attached to in their Turn but not both at once.

#### **Disposable Launcher**

#### **Class:** Basic (Launcher)

This weapon is popular with PDF forces as it is simple to use and requires no loading or reloading. These weapons normally come pre-loaded with a single frag or krak missile. Some disposable launchers come loaded with rocket-propelled frag or krak grenades instead—these versions are half the normal cost.

#### **Missile Launcher**

#### **Class:** Heavy (Launcher)

The most powerful launcher weapon, they fire a variety of specialised rounds at long distances. Each missile is fitted with stabilization and guidance systems to aid their accuracy.

#### **Melta Weapons Multi-Melta** Melta Weapons

#### **Class:** Heavy (Melta)

The largest melta weapon and usually only found within the ranks of the Astartes or on Imperial vehicles. This huge weapon can fire in much longer ranges and creates a larger blast area, cooking several square meters at a time. It also generates much more heat than its smaller cousins, and most users must insulate themselves with protective clothing or armour.

#### **Thermal Lance**

**Class:** Heavy (Melta)

A more refined melta weapon, a thermal lance uses additional magnetic containment beams to guide the superheated flow through an extended barrel, resulting in less dispersion and tighter control. It is often used for precise cutting, but doubles nicely as a weapon for slicing through armour and bulkheads in focused cuts.

#### **Voss Pattern Mark III Ultimo**

#### **Meltagun**

**Class:** Basic (Melta)

Somewhat larger than the standard melta gun, it fires a more accurate and directed heat beam. The longer barrel provides for added directional containment to reduce dispersal, but at the cost of reduced firepower.

#### **Plasma Weapons Mars Pattern Mark III Sunfury Assault Plasma Gun** Plasma Weapons

**Class:** Basic (Plasma)

A high-power weapon issued to Imperial Guard units facing heavily armoured foes. The Sunfury can spit out plasma bolts capable of destroying even light vehicles with ease, although its rate of fuel consumption is high. Its reputation grew in the Calixis Sector when it was used great effect during the Meritates Uprising along the Ixaniad border several hundred years ago against the augmetic reavers of the savage Meritech clans.

#### **Plasma Blaster**

#### **Class:** Basic (Plasma)

A unique variant crafted as a combi-weapon, it incorporates two plasma guns which, when fired together, give twice the effective damage, but also at a higher risk to the user. The guns share the same fuel canisters, lowering the weight of the weapon but keeping the number of shots it can fire to roughly the same as a regular plasma gun.

#### **Plasma Cannon**

**Class:** Heavy (Plasma)

Most often seen on Imperial vehicles, a plasma cannon requires a large separate fuel container. It can also be fired in maximal mode, which consumes six shots worth of fuel but provides a blast of solar heat on impact, creating a fireball of stellar temperatures.

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **Alcher Mark IV Combat Autogun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

This weapon is popular with PDF forces across the sector, where the simple setting (one shot or full automatic) fits better with the generally less well-trained soldiers. The larger magazine size helps keep up with the higher rate of shooting.

#### **Assault Cannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (SP)

Assault cannons are equipped with six rapidly rotating barrels in a gatling-style configuration firing diamantine tipped shells. The barrels wear out quickly due to the intense heat generated by the internal motor that spins them, and normally require replacements after each mission to prevent jamming or catastrophic failure.

Assault cannons are nasty for their sheer rate of fire that lets them progressively "chew" through targets.

#### **Autocannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (SP)

An autocannon is a very brutal weapon, noisy and hard to control in action, and requires a team of two operators (firer and loader) for effective use. Autocannons use cased, explosive shells fired at a high rate to destroy their target. On the battlefield they provide excellent infantry support.

#### **Dorcas Pattern Trophy Stub**

#### **Automatic**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Awarded by many Calixian regiments as a commendation for the lower ranks, pistols of this type were first taken as battlefield trophies during the Second Insurrection of Cantus centuries ago. Relics from that fabled war are highly valued, but most Guard veterans are content with a more modern copy, awarded as they are for valour in the face of the foe.

#### **Orthlack Mark IVThollos**

#### **Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Produced by the Fane of Orthlack in Gunmetal City, the "Thollos" or "Tholl" has long been a popular backup weapon for line officers in Calixian Guard units, who favour its stopping power over most regulation sidearms. Indeed, so common has the practice of carrying one become that many old military families often present their sons and daughters with a commemoratively inscribed Thollos to mark their first commission.

#### **Grenades and Missiles** Grenades and Missiles

*"Throne, that's a pretty sight. OK, prep for second det on my mark."*

> — Lieutenant Mox Travellian, 1st Company Demolitions Squad, 87th Aubin Grenadiers.

#### **Frag Missile**

This is a heavier version of the frag grenade designed primarily as an anti-personnel weapon. Frag missiles can only be used in missile launchers.

#### **Inferno Thermal Grenade**

These devices explode with a shower of molten metal as their incendiary fuel ignites. They are not as powerful as a melta-bomb and thus cannot burn though most armour, but are useful for melting down simple barricades and doors or for starting fires. These grenades can be purchased to be used either by hand (thrown) or in grenade or RPG launchers. They can also be found in missile form.

#### **Krak Missile**

Used as tank-killers, there is little that can survive a direct hit from a krak missile. Krak missiles can only be used in missile launchers.

## **Gunmetal Solid Mark III Frag**

#### **Grenade**

Gunmetal is known for producing a slightly heavier version grenade, ideal where a larger blast is needed. These grenades can be purchased to be used either by hand (thrown) or in grenade or RPG launchers.

#### **Stun Grenade**

Designed to incapacitate and disorient rather than kill, a stun grenade's concussive effect, thunderous noise and bright flash is highly effective and usually causes no lasting injury. Anyone caught in a stun grenade's blast must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or become Stunned for 1d5 Rounds. Photo-visors and sealed armour provide a +20 bonus to this Test.

#### **Explosives Det-Cord and Det-Tape** Explosives

Det-cord and det-tape are the two most common types of timer material, often used in conjunction with tube-charges. The delay is set by either peeling back the tape or cutting the cord to the desired length. Both can be used as a low-grade explosive material in an emergency, inflicting 1d5 X Damage for every one kilogram used with a blast radius of twice its weight in kilograms.

#### **Fyceline**

A chemical used in many standard Imperial explosives, it is mined from rare ores and its production often becomes the primary tithe for many planets. Refined fyceline can be used to fashion crude explosives. Fyceline explosives inflict 1d10+5 X Damage for every kilogram used in their construction and have a blast radius of five times their weight in kilograms.

#### **Cressin Pattern Limpet Mine**

A less powerful and less expensive directional explosive similar to the melta bomb, it is applied directly to the target structure and focuses the blast against it. The resulting explosion is more powerful than a regular krak detonation. When a limpet mine explodes, it deals 4d10 X Damage to anything within one metre, with a Penetration of 8.

#### **Mines**

Mines can be made from pretty much any of the explosives and grenades listed here, and use triggers from simple pressure-sensors to advanced bioscanners. Most are placed just under the ground and are designed to explode underground, whilst others spring into the air when triggered to maximize shrapnel damage. Imperial Guard troopers are trained in using frag grenades to fashion improvised mines and booby traps. Only careful observation of your surroundings (or a good mine-detector) can pick out a well hidden mine.

#### **Melta Bomb**

Designed to be manually fixed to their target with mag-adhesives, melta bombs detonate with a charge of intense heat similar in effect to a melta weapon, and are ideal for destroying bulkheads, vehicle hulls and other heavily armoured targets. Imperial melta bombs are roughly domed in shape but heavy and unwieldy and not designed to be thrown. When a melta bomb explodes it deals 6d10 E Damage to anything within two metres with a Penetration of 12. Anything surviving must take an Agility Test or catch on fire.

#### **Promethium**

Petrochem-based liquid fuel, promethium is the jelly-like substance used to power flamer weapons. It can also be used to create anti-personnel explosives and bombs as it is highly flammable. Promethium explosives inflict 2d10 E Damage for every kilogram used in their construction and have a blast radius of four times their weight in kilograms. In addition, anyone caught in the radius of a promethium explosion must make an Agility Test or catch on fire.

#### **Weapon Upgrades Duplus Ammo Clips** Weapon Upgrades

Double-ended ammunition clips designed to shorten reloading time. Users simply flip the clip over when one side is exhausted. The clip is effectively two clips attached to each other and requires two clips worth of ammo to fill. A weapon with these special clips reduces their loading time by half (thus a weapon that takes two Full Actions to reload becomes a single Full Action). Normally only utilised by officers—troopers finding tape just as effective to holding to clips together, and a lot cheaper!

**Upgrades:** Any Basic, Pistol, Solid Projectile or Las weapon with a removable clip.

#### **Forearm Weapon Mounting**

As the name suggests, these heavy gauntlets allow for a single ranged weapon to be mounted along the arm, with specific hand movement triggering the weapon. This upgrade allows the user to keep both hands free. A weapon in a forearm mount functions as listed except that its range is reduced by 30%.

**Upgrades:** Any Primitive, Las, Solid Projectile, Bolt or Melta pistol.

#### **The Tranch War**

A grimy and relatively minor hive world, Tranch's only lasting fame is a slow burning and vicious civil conflict that, despite countless lives lost, shows no sign of abating. Tranch's economy before the war was sustained in part by a sizable population of mutants utilised as slave labour in the Soot Warrens of the furnace levels. Its masters, the Oligarchs of Tranch, were pitiless and sadistic rulers with a history of brutal repression. When a portion of the mutant population rose up, few dreamed it would spark a conflict that would spread to engulf the entire planet and leave more than a billion dead. As initial policing actions by the Oligarchs' brutal enforcers failed, and battles boiled over from the warrens to the hab levels, it became clear that the mutants had powerful help and organisation on their side. Led by the Shrouds, a cabal of powerful rogue psykers and witches, the mutant's onslaught was further aided by the terrorist attacks of hidden Chaos cults that struck without warning in the upper hives, sowing confusion and terror in the spires. As the situation rapidly worsened, the Oligarchs' grip on power began to slip and, giving in to fear, they redeployed troops away from the mid-hive levels in order to protect their own interests—with disastrous results. The mutants surged up from the depths and slaughtered thousands. Soon the Oligarchs faced a second popular revolt by the masses they had all but abandoned. Tranch descended almost overnight into anarchy, and as news and lawlessness spread, nearby worlds, many long suffering from woes of their own, threatened to do the same.

Seeing a world under his domain slipping unexpectedly into Chaos and with others threatening to follow suit, a bloody lesson was clearly needed and Lord Hax himself personally gave the order to raise regiments to "Crush this foul and treacherous vipers' nest in our blessed Emperor's dominion." Regiments were raised from Scintilla, Malfi, Iocanthos and elsewhere to descend upon beleaguered Tranch, accompanied by elements from the Holy Ordos who sought to decapitate the tainted rebellion's warp-twisted leadership. The war that followed is considered to be the most brutal in living memory in the Calixis Sector. Although the grip of the Shroud Council was swiftly broken and the mutants' unity shattered, the war did not end, and, instead of a single mutant army to face, there were now countless numbers of rebel factions, mutant bands, cults and scavengers picking over the burned out and shattered hives to contend with—with no easy victory in sight. The purging campaign took nearly five years of inglorious and dirty warfare. Afterward, Tranch was left a seething pit of conflict and discord, and many of those "saved" now relegated to the status of empty-eyed refugees eking out what living they could in the ruins.

Now classified as "officially pacified", the Calixian Guard regiments who are routinely rotated through deployments on Tranch still take the brunt of the slowly simmering conflict and must face a thankless war of ambushes, desperate victims, booby traps, atrocities and ever present terror. Tranch today is still a militarised zone, administered as a fiefdom of the powers of the Malfian sub-sector. Large-scale efforts to recolonise and restart the world's industry have only been partially successful, and whole hive spires, not to mention much of the Soot Warrens, are still lawless battlegrounds—the domain of rogue mutants and worse.

#### **Targeter**

Expensive, heavy and rarely used except by elite forces, a targeter uses a variety of guidance cogitators and omni-sights to improve accuracy. These upgrades are normally hard-wired into a specific weapon for maximum efficiency. Commonly viewed as adding to the weapon's machine-spirit, they create an even closer bond between gunner and gun. A targeter grants a +10 bonus on all Ballistic Skill Tests made with the weapon.

**Upgrades:** Any Las, Solid Projectile, Bolt or Heavy weapon.

#### **Tripod and Bipods**

These attachments are for heavier weapons or those using integral ammunition canisters rather than a backpackmounted source (such as plasma guns or meltaguns). Resting the weapon on the ground increases accuracy but sacrifices mobility, thus making them more common in static defence lines. Bipods and tripods allow a weapon to be braced anywhere there is a reasonably flat surface. A weapon braced on a bipod has a 90-degree fire arc while one on a tripod has a 180-degree arc. Bracing with a tripod requires a Full Action. Bracing with a bipod requires a Half Action.

**Upgrades:** Any Basic or Heavy weapon.

*"No, bring your blade up to parry, then across. Try again. No, that's totally wrong! Ten lashes for getting blood on my uniform. Medic!"*

— Corporel Linus Razreil, Drill Instructor, Mordian

21st Expeditionary Force.

#### **Combat Knife**

**Class:** Melee (Primitive)

These oversized bladed weapons are almost to the size of a short sword. Each has a heavy, straight-edged blade designed to cut flesh as well as puncture light armour, and can be affixed to most basic weapons as a bayonet.

#### **Guard Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Several guard regiments use modern shields as part of their combat style, particularly the Wasteland Legionnaires who often advance through hostile areas with camouflaged shields. They are generally made from quality plasteel plates, lighter than they would appear. Some even have small visors of glassteel so that the user can peer out without sacrificing protection. Guard shields can provide cover for the user concealing all of their body should they choose. As cover, a guard shield provides 6 Armour Points.

#### **Trophy Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Many fighters use the remains of their kill to fashion a memento of the action, and xenos fighters are no exception. A thriving secondary business goes on in many regiments where claws and teeth from alien creatures are removed and honed into valuable weapons. Each is a unique creation representing some of the monstrous races that have threatened the sector, some even unknown by scholars. They serve to show off the battlefield prowess of a warrior to their fellow troopers.

#### **Power Fist**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

Rather than encasing an edged weapon with a power field, the energy field here is instead used to disrupt material in a more violent fashion. Worn as a hugely oversized glove, when the mechanically augmented fist strikes or clenches its target it can tear open the heaviest armour. Unprotected enemies simply erupt in a shower of ruined flesh, as if a grenade had exploded inside them. Power fists are more common as part of power armour suits where the massive power requirements can be met by integral energy packs, but some elite Imperial forces and high-ranking officers also use them with the aid of backpack power sources.

#### **Waller Pattern Mark VI Power Longsword**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

As the name suggests these blades are longer than normal power swords, requiring two hands to wield effectively. They are popular among the Brontian Longknives.

# <span id="page-181-0"></span>Armour Armour

*"Your faith is indeed admirable Confessor. But I'll keep my helmet on."*

— Captain Vladmir Gatt, 115th Yostin Royal Guards.

#### **Windrider Carapace Scale Armour**

An odd mix of armour styles, this uses small diamond shaped armplas plates bound together in overlapping sections, forming a flexible covering that is less restrictive than normal carapace armour. The officers of the Lacustan Windriders favour this armour for the extra mobility it affords, as well as its savage appearance.

#### **Flak Greatcoat**

Many Imperial Guard and PDF officers favour these heavy garments, as they offer protection against colder climates as well as enemy fire. Stylish as well as functional, they are also favourites among civilian fighters as well.

#### **Lidhl Light Power Armour**

Despite its heavily ornamented and impressive visage, this armour it is at the low end of protective value. It sees the most widespread use among the officers of the Scintillan Guard, for it allows a great deal of customisation to better display their heraldry and accomplishments.

#### **Refractor Field**

Although still very rare, refractor fields are perhaps the commonest form of force field defence available in the Imperium. Their creation is a closely guarded secret, a relic of a more "powerful" age. Sometimes employed by Imperial Guard officers of high rank, the wealthy scions of noble houses or awarded as a mark of great distinction to senior Adepta, refractor fields take the form of elaborate gorgets or belt units that generate an all but invisible impedance field a short distance away from the body which refracts and defects energy.

A refractor field generator is a kind of force field defence. Anytime that the wearer is struck by high velocity Impact, Energy (gunfire, etc.) Explosive (bolt weapons) attacks; they may roll 2d10 and reduce the Damage dealt by the sum of the dice. Should the wearer roll double ones ("11"), the attack bypasses the field completely (do not reduce the Damage). If the wearer rolls double tens ("00"), the field overloads and the power cell burns out and must be replaced (Damage is reduced by 20).

Refractor fields of this type are ineffective against very close range or slow moving attacks such as blows struck in close combat, mines and the like.

The compact high-discharge powers cells are enough for 1 hour of continuous use and are classed as Rare items with a base cost of 1,000 Thrones each. The power cells are not re-chargeable.

# <span id="page-182-0"></span>Infantry Gear In fan try Gear

*"The most important item of gear cannot be carried in your kit, and that is your faith in the Emperor. Without that, nothing can help you."*

— Imperial Guard saying.

#### **The 9-70 Entrenching Tool**

Used mostly to fill sandbags, this small folding shovel is durable and handy for a variety of other duties such as ditch and grave digging. It also serves as a nasty improvised weapon.

#### **Backpack or Field Sack**

Heavy and durable, each can hold almost everything listed here. For many a Guardsman a field sack also serves as his body bag when his service to the Emperor comes to an end.

#### **Bedroll**

Bedrolls are one of the infantrymen's favoured possessions, for it offers a modicum of comfort at night or whenever there is a change to catch a few winks. Bedrolls include heavy blankets.

#### **Compass/Orienting Device**

Normally a simple magnetic compass, calibrated to current planetary true and magnetic polar locations, these tools are vital additions to any infantryman's kit.

#### **Dog Tags**

Dog tags are issued to all Imperial soldiers and often serve as the only means of identifying their remains. The more heretical renegades collect them as souvenirs.

#### **Hostile Weather Gear**

Depending on the battlefield, additional items such as tent liners, heating bricks, sunscreen, extra blankets, insect repellent, heavy gloves, greatcoats or parkas, filtration plugs, rad pills and more can be issued.

#### **The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer**

One of the most widespread books in the galaxy, every Imperial Guardsman must (by regulation) have a copy of it on their person at all times. It is filled with useful information including xenos recognition, weapon maintenance and use, survival and medical tips, and combat formations. More importantly, it carries prayers, hymns, litanies and inspirational passages to ensure that proper spiritual and morale levels are kept at proper levels.

#### **Infantry Lamp Pack**

Rugged and compact, these light sources can be hand-held or fitted to the bayonet lugs on most rifles. A focusing dial on the lens can adjust the beam to either a wide swath for general lighting or a tight longer range illumination. A lamp pack runs for 1d5+5 hours on a standard charge.

#### **Mess Kit**

A mess kit contains a combination spoon and fork, knife and collapsible mug, all fitting into a clamshell container that doubles as tray. Often a meal is simply placed in the container, closed tightly, and dropped into an open fire for rapid cooking.

#### **Personal Grooming Kit**

These kits include shaving gear, soap, dental care items and other things as deemed appropriate by the regimental commander, such as anti-fungal and parasite powders.

# VI: War Zones

#### <span id="page-183-0"></span>**Sandbags**

Doubly useful in the field as they can be filled with earth or sand to provide protection, or filled with clothing to create a makeshift pillow.

#### **Tent**

Simple and durable, this tent can fit two people and their gear. Standard issue tents are waterproof with a reflective side for sun-baked climates.

#### **Tool Kit**

A small set of screwdrivers, wrenches, wire and other items for maintenance and routine repairs, tool kits often contain rolls of "mud tape" (named as it sticks to everything and never comes off ) and a small multi-purpose axe as well.

#### **Uniform**

While many things are standardised in the Imperial Guard, uniforms are definitely not one of them. Each regiment has their own styles of dress, depending on their home world, background and combat style. In the Calixis Sector, uniforms can range from the impeccable dress of the Scintillan platoons to the ragged colours of the Penal Legions. Each also has differing standards such that individuals in each platoon may even maintain different battledress uniforms. Most, though, consist of heavy durable clothing and tough boots with thick socks to withstand a lifetime's worth of marching. Rain gear, gloves and other items can be included depending on Munitorum decree.

#### **Weapon/Gear Storage**

A variety of durable lightweight items used to store items such as ammunition packs, sidearm weapons and grenades. Common forms are hip packs, holsters, bandoliers and vests. Worn over armour, they allow easy storage while keeping the arms free for fighting. Most items a soldier needs quickly are carried in them, especially ammunition clips, grenades and a sidearm. Like uniforms these can vary from regiment to regiment. The harness can hold a maximum of 15 kg worth of small items.

#### **Weapon Maintenance Kit**

Most commonly designed around the ubiquitous lasgun, each kit includes items such as blessed oils and lubricants, swabbing cloths, cleaning gels, weapon-specific tools and spare parts such as a spare stock and barrel. As standard, these kits are calibrated to Calixis-patterns, but generally work on all Munitorum-issued lasguns. Bear in mind, without the proper litanies and invocations, however, even the finest efforts will not ensure that the weapon maintains its proper function.

#### **Whistle**

A surprisingly effective tool for alerting other members of your platoon of dangers or calling for help, whistles are standard issue. Some of the Scintillan regiments have adopted

hiver ocarinas to also relay battle instructions in coded tones when electronic communications may be compromised.

#### **Battlefield Rations Civilian Relief Rations** Battlefield Rations

Ration bricks made from recycled food waste or any other organic materials, used for civilian relief in areas of intense fighting. Also known as "Emperor's Mercy" bars, each can just barely keep a person alive for a day. The less said about their taste the better.

#### **Combat Ration Pack**

Each metallic pouch contains foodstuffs for one complete meal (including vitamin supplements) along with salt and water puri-tabs, a protein bar and minor medical supplies. No cooking is required but most troops either use open flames, squad hexamine stoves or their tank armour to heat them where possible. These packs are more or less sufficient to keep a soldier fighting, albeit flavourless (or worse bad tasting) and unappealing for extended use.

#### **Daily Prayers**

Another civilian relief item, these parchments can be airdropped into cities or even rolled up and fired from grenades or mortars. Each contains inspirational addresses to maintain spiritual wellbeing and morale. Each is also heavily imprinted with nutrients chewed they can sustain physical well-being as well.

| Table 6–7: War Zone Battlefield Rations |      |       |              |  |  |  |  |  |

| Long Duration Ration Pack               | 5    | 1kg   | Common       |  |  |  |  |  |

#### **Emergency Rations**

Just a step above relief rations, these are generally stowed in tanks or aircraft to supplement individual packs. When a unit must wait for relief or rescue, they can stretch daily packs into weeks of sustenance.

#### **Long Duration Ration Pack**

Much the same as a regular pack, but includes higher-energy items for troopers conducting forced marches or intense activities away from central command.

#### <span id="page-184-0"></span>**Drugs and Medical Gear** Drugs and Medical Gear

*"Faith heals all wounds."*

— Ancient saying of the Orders Hospitaller.

All Guardsmen carry a standard basic medikit, which can vary in contents and effectiveness from regiment to regiment. Advanced medikits are standard issue gear for Medicae in the field. Other medical help is available for most Guardsmen and other combatants, ranging from the simple to the sophisticated.

#### **Cast Spray**

A variation of synth-skin, cast spray forms a tough rigid coating over broken limbs so the trooper can be more easily transported. The temporary cast has coagulants and counterseptic drugs laced into the material to help fight Blood Loss and infection (reduces Difficulty of Medicae Test to stop Blood Loss by one-step).

#### **Counterseptics**

These include a broad range of antiseptics and analgesics to fight off infections, either injected via a pre-packaged needle or ingested in tab form. When taken, a counterseptic drug gives a +20 bonus on any Tests made to resist disease or infections for six hours.

#### **Ghostfire Pollen Extract**

An incredibly dangerous liquid distilled from the condensed pollen of the Ghostfire flowers of Iocanthos, Ghostfire extract is the material from which the bulk of the Segmentum Obscurus's versions of Frenzon are actually derived. The potency of the extract is such that the Imperium long ago concluded it was a far better idea to create a "lesser version" than lose soldiers to the overwhelming effects of a pure dose.

A dose of Ghostfire pollen extract grants the Fearless and Frenzy talents and the Unnatural Agility (×2) trait. The effects last for 2d10 minutes. As a side effect, however, the user takes 1 point of Damage (ignoring Armour and Toughness Bonus) as he bleeds through his pores.

#### **Halo**

Commonly given to Penal Legionnaries, Halo creates a compliant state suitable for combat prisoner indoctrination. Users can be better readied and even made enthusiastic to meet their coming fate on the battlefield. Other heavily stressed troopers use it to forcibly induce a calmer frame of mind. A dose of Halo adds +10 on all tests to resist Fear and Pinning, but reduces Perception by -10, effects lasts for 1d10 hours.

#### **Kick**

A potent combination of neural accelerants and stimulants, Kick makes the user feel supercharged with energy. It is ideal for short-term assaults as the effects burn off rapidly inducing profound fatigue and listlessness for the next several hours. A single dose of Kick removes all Fatigue levels and provides immunity to Fatigue for 2d10 Rounds. Once it wears off, the user takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.

#### **Rainbow**

A somewhat dangerous all-in-one injection covering almost anything that can be wrong with someone. It includes an anti-bacterial serum, a blood clotting agent, an allergen, poison and radiation antidote broad-band immune booster, vitamins, a white cell stimulator and a sedative. This much stimulation to the body's system can also cause massive shock, but when faced with a life or death situation against an unknown ailment some medicae take the gamble. An application of this drug allows the patient to immediately re-roll any failed Tests to resist disease or toxins and automatically stops Blood Loss. However, users must also immediately succeed on a Toughness Test or take 1d5 points of Damage ignoring Armour and Toughness Bonus.

#### **Synth-Skin**

A thin foam sprayed over burned flesh wounds to staunch bleeding and promote new skin regeneration, synth-skin is commonly issued to troopers for their own battlefield dressings. An application of synth-skin, a Full Action, stops Blood Loss.

#### **Toxin Wands**

Easy to use by untrained personnel, toxin wands work to detect poisons and recommend counter-agents and immunisers. A character can use a toxin wand to determine whether or not someone has been poisoned or not by succeeding at a Challenging (+0) Perception Test or a Routine (+20) Medicae Test. Success by two or more degrees also grants enough information to identify an antidote (if one exists).

### Chapter VII: The Holy Ordos Chapter VII: The Holy Ordos

*"There exist out there in the unbroached void of night and in the deeper darkness beyond, things so terrible and vile that they would devour us and destroy everything we have made. And why? Because they fear us—and rightly so, for we are humanity and the stars are ours."*

— Lord Solar Macharius, *On the Eve of the Macharian Crusade*.

Rather than detailing the kind of specialised weapons and gear you might find on a particular world, this chapter illustrates some of the unique tools of the Holy Ordos of the Inquisition itself. The Calixian Conclave and its agents span the sector from the imposing bulk of the Tricorn R

Palace on Scintilla to lonely fortress stations and hidden watchposts on scores of worlds. The tools of the Inquisition and its agents are similarly diverse. The Holy Ordos thrives on adaptability and demands it from its servants, and an Acolyte that cannot make do with what they have to hand isn't worthy of the title. This having been said, there are certain tasks that the Holy Ordos must undertake and enemies they must face that demand more "unique" responses and solutions than most people can imagine. In answer to this, over the years the Calixian Conclave has built up is own specialised arsenal of strange weapons and bizarre devices to meet the xenos, the Daemon and the heretic head-on if needs be, and it is these mysterious and often savage artefacts you will find here.

Most of the items listed in this chapter are singular and rare creations, and available only from sources either within the Holy Ordos itself or contacts among high-ranking members of one of the Adepta. Base prices and Availability are still listed for these, but these should be viewed as measures of how common these items are and what kind of value is placed on them by those that create them, and rather than simply stumping up cash to the amount given, some other task, favour or boon of like value might be asked instead.

#### **Catechist Pattern Stake-Crossbow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

An usual weapon to say the least, the Catechist-pattern is a high-power, self-loading mechanical crossbow weapon designed not to fire regular crossbow bolts but rather specially constructed 15 centimetre adamantine-silver alloy stakes. These stakes, as well as being diamantine-tipped and fired with sufficient force to pierce body armour, are microetched with deadly prayers of anathema against the witch and the Daemon and feature razor barbs that snap out from the stake to embed in the target's flesh.

The special stake-bolts fired by the Catechist count as "holy" weapons, and so many have a particular effect on certain warp creatures (as will be noted in their description) and count as having the Tearing effect when used against targets with a Psy Rating or Sorcery. If more than 5 points of Damage are dealt after Armour and Toughness Bonus, the bolt becomes embedded in the victim. Removing the bolt by force deals an additional 1d5 points of Damage ignoring Armour and Toughness Bonus.

Stake-bolts for the Catechist can only be acquired through the Holy Ordos itself, for the purposes of getting hold of them they have a base price of 50 Thrones each and Rare Availability.

#### **Sacristan Bolt Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

This class of bolt pistol is produced under secret license for the Ordos Calixis by the Fane of Orthlack on Scintilla, and is based on the ancient and venerated Godwyn-De'az patterns used by Adepta Sororitas. Although bolt pistols are both relatively rare and expensive to maintain, their great killing power is extremely valued, and the Sacristan, branded and sealed with the symbol of the Holy Ordos itself, is the chosen sidearm of many Inquisitors and senior Acolytes alike who see it as a mark of rank.

Unless the firer has a Strength Bonus of 4 or more, the Sacristan imposes a –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests due to its massive size and recoil.

#### **Eviscerator**

#### **Class:** Melee (Chain)

Favoured by Ecclesiarchy zealots and witch-hunters, the eviscerator is an obscenely large double-handed chain weapon fitted with a crude version of the disruption field generator more commonly found on power-blades. Although very unwieldy and tiring to use, the eviscerator is fully capable of ripping an armoured man in half or tearing open the most blasphemously corrupted mutant in a single stroke. Outside of the agents of the Holy Ordos, the Redemptionist sects that plague the lower levels of Hive Tarsus on Scintilla employ the eviscerator as a weapon of terror and corporal mortification.

Any character that rolls 96–00 on their attack roll while wielding an eviscerator risks losing control of the roaring chain blade and must succeed on an Agility Test or take Damage as if struck by the weapon (including the wielder's SB).

#### **Force Weapons**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Made from the rarest materials and interlaced with psychic reactive and channelling circuitry of a design said to have originated with the Emperor himself when he walked among mortal men, force weapons are capable of channelling the mental power and aggression of a psyker into deadly, realityrending force. It is theoretically possible to create force weapons in almost any form, and several unique and potent variants, such as the Nemesis weapons of the Grey Knights and the legendarily destructive Daemonhammers, exist. The three commonest types of force weapons are given here, the force sword, force axe and force staff.

Unless wielded by a psyker, force weapons simply count as a Good Craftsmanship Mono variant of their standard Primitive weapon type (see pages 128 and 142 of Dark Heresy). However, in the hands of a wielder with a Psy Rating, they are much more. For every point of Psy Rating the wielder has, the weapon's Damage and Penetration increases by +1. For example, a force sword wielded by a character with Psy Rating 3 would inflict 1d10+3 R (plus SB) and have a Penetration of 5.

In addition to normal Damage, whenever a psyker damages an opponent, he or she may, as a Free Action, channel psychic force and killing will into the blade. Treat this effect as a power with a Threshold 6. On a success, the wielder and victim make Opposed Willpower Tests. For every degree of success, the force weapon's wielder deals an additional 1d10 points of Damage ignoring the victim's Armour and Toughness Bonus.

Force weapons cannot be destroyed by a power weapon's field.

A force staff also acts as a Psy-Focus (see page 151 of Dark Heresy).

#### **Witch Lance**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

A potent weapon that is a mix of the techno-arcane and the sacred, the Witch Lance, sometimes also known as a "power stake" or "excoriator" is designed to destroy rogue psykers and witches utterly and without mercy. A heavily modified power weapon taking the form of a metre and a half long spear or stake of cold iron and adamantine, it contains at its heart a pressure-release reservoir of concentrated promethium mixed with sacred oils and anti-psy compounds. Should the lance successfully impale the victim's body this mixture is explosively vented, consuming the victim utterly in a blast of holy fire.

Whenever Righteous Fury results while fighting with a witch lance, the weapon deals an additional 2d10 E Holy Damage and sets the victim on fire in lieu of the normal results of Righteous Fury.

#### **The Blades of Inquisitor Herrod**

A renowned member of the Calixian Conclave for nearly two centuries, Inquisitor Herrod famously owned a pair of anointed Lathe-sabres and acquired a skill for using them that made him one of the most feared swordsmen of his time. Forged in the high Imperial style, these long, louche sabres sent countless heretics and unclean beasts to their deaths. Herrod himself was an infamous duellist, ready to avenge any slight with blood—even one made by a fellow Inquisitor. Herrod habitually bore one of the blades himself, while the second was carried by his foremost Acolyte during his apprenticeship as a mark of honour. On the nine occasions during his career that Herrod officially sponsored one of his charges to full Inquisitorial rank, he presented them with a Lathe-blade of their own, never a copy of his but each a unique design that "best suited their true character". Seventy years ago, Herrod and his ship disappeared without trace while pursuing a horrific warp cult known as the Vile Savants deep into the Halo Stars, but tales of the flamboyant Herrod and his gifts live on, not least because Herrod's blades are now borne by several of the sector's most renowned Inquisitors.

<span id="page-189-0"></span>*"Daemon I name thee! By the writ Holy Ordos of the Inquisition I abjure thee! By silver and sacred fire I burn thee! With the armour of my contempt I mock thee! Perish in the formless pit of nightmare that spawned thee! In the name of the Emperor, Daemon I cast thee out!"* — Inquisitor-Exorcist Harkness, Ordo Malleus.

#### **Hexagramatic Wards**

Powerful wards, null-psy lattice circuits and prayers of protection are woven into armour carrying this upgrade, often visually represented by ornate carvings and graven icons embellishing its surface. Armour upgraded in this way serves not only to protect the wearer's body but also their soul.

Armour with this upgrade provides it wearer with a +20 bonus on Tests made to resist any direct psychic attack or manipulation used against them. Additionally, the armour provides double the Armour Points against attacks of psychic force or warpenergy that directly deal Damage (such as the Psychic Blade or Fire Bolt powers), and keeps its value against attacks made with the Warp Weapon effect.

**Upgrades:** Carapace breastplate, full carapace armour and power armour.

#### **Rosarius**

A protective device granted to senior members of the Ecclesiarchy's chamber militant and most zealous battlefield preachers, this traditional badge of faith also incorporates a powerful conversion field generator to shield its wearer from harm. Because of their close ecumenical ties to the priesthood, Inquisitors and agents of the Ordo Hereticus are often found in possession of Rosarius and depend on their almost miraculous powers to fend off harm.

The Rosarius' conversion field is generated some distance away from the wearer and so has no effect against blows struck in close combat. Roll 2d10 and reduce the Damage caused from ranged attacks by this amount. If "11" is rolled, the attack has slipped through the field completely and the Damage is not reduced at all. If "00" is rolled, the Damage is reduced by 20 but the Rosarius has been temporarily overloaded and may not be used for another 1d10 Rounds. If the Rosarius overloads, roll an additional 1d10. If this rolls a "9" the generator has failed and it may not be used again until repaired.

Additionally, as this is a conversion field system and works in part by transforming incoming energy into radiant light, if the field blocks more than 12 points of Damage from any single attack, the blast of light released is the equivalent to the effects of a photon flash grenade centred on the wearer (see page 137 of Dark Heresy).

#### **The Tetragon Facility**

Aside from it "public" face in the form of the Tricorn Palace on Scintilla and its fortresses on other worlds, the Inquisition has numerous other holdings whose names and natures are secret even to its own. The Tetragon Facility is one such locale. An echoing cold space station whose origin and original purpose are lost to silent history, it now serves the Tyrantine Cabal. Empty and dead save when it is in use, the Tetragon is comprised of data-looms and stack archives, forensic bays and sensor auguries, it has staterooms for scores and barracks for a thousand and cells for thousands more. Its function is to go wherever it is needed, towed into position by the leviathan-power of Mechanicus Highliners to serve as a forward base to observe the aftermath of Komus's visitations and mark the passage of the Tyrant Star. Once all that can be learned has been learned, the concentrated data is rendered down and transferred to the Bastion Serpentis, the Tetragon is purged and falls silent once more until it is needed again. Rumours persist though that other shadowy forces within the Ordos still use the Tetragon in the long, cold dark between visitations for purposes of their own, for inquiries, for trials and experiments perhaps, things they cannot afford even their brethren to know…

*"You think you can be an Inquisitor just because you've the courage to kill? Ha! Wisdom is a more terrible weapon than bravery, or hate, or even love.

— Inquisitor Herrod.

#### **Blessed Ammunition and Sanctified Weapons**

The prayers and blessing of those of true faith in the God-Emperor of Mankind, coupled with the ancient lore of Ecclesiastical alchemistry, is able to turn mere mundane bullets and blades into weapons that are capable of harming the foul denizens of the warp and other such unnatural horrors.

The sole effect of these upgrades is to make the Damage caused by the weapon in question counted as "Holy", which has certain effects on some Daemonic and warp creatures (as will be noted in their description). Obtaining such items is only possible through the Holy Ordos or high-ranking members of the Ecclesiarchy, and the cost and rarity shown reflects this.

Blessed Ammunition is used with: Bolt Weapons, Flamers, and Solid Projectile Weapons.

**Sanctified Weapon Upgrades:** Any Primitive weapon (including Mono upgraded weapons) or Chain weapon of at least Good quality craftsmanship.

#### **Null Box**

Occasionally vital for preserving or safely containing a sample or woeful artefact, null boxes are portable stasis field generators in the shape of small armoured boxes, although some go right up to the size of a large chest or sarcophagus. Inside a stasis field, all time and motion halts and whatever is trapped inside is effectively frozen and removed from any interaction with reality—essentially contained in a psychic dead zone. True relics of the Dark Age of Technology, most null boxes are extraordinarily resilient and tough (almost supernaturally so, which may be the result of the time-control field within) and once active require no further power unless deactivated and turned on again. For obvious reasons the control mechanisms of most null boxes are often hidden and heavily encrypted. Unless breached with enormous force or simply turned off by someone able to do so, a null box and its contents can out-sit eternity if needs be.

#### **Psy-Jammer**

Somewhat esoteric examples of techno-arcana, these devices can at least partially disrupt psychic energy and offer some degree of protection against the dark arts of the psyker and the witch. Expensive and rare, their use is largely restricted to the agents of the Holy Ordos, the Mechanicus itself and those among the Imperium's elites whose paranoia often matches their vast wealth. Much more powerful examples of anti-psy technology do exist but they have a tendency to be exceeding rare and often unique.

Psy-jammers can be obtained in two types: a protective amulet and a cranial implant. The amulet has the disadvantage that it can be physically removed; but while the implant cannot be so easily countered, it can have unpleasant long-term side effects to the user.

A psy-jammer grants its wearer a +20 bonus on any Test involved to resist the effects of a Psychic Power and +10 bonus

#### **The Blasphemy of Erya Nephthys**

Perhaps the greatest foe any Inquisitor fears to face is one of their own number turned renegade. The sealed and proscribed annals of Imperial history accounts the dark paths of some whose very names have become bywords of treachery and destruction, but for the Calixian Conclave, there is no renegade in living memory more reviled than Erya Nephthys. Renowned as a dogmatic Monodominant within Ordo Hereticus, beneath Erya's façade shadows grew and festered in her heart: she had become utterly and secretly obsessed with her own survival at all costs. Wounded many times over her career, she had lost an arm to a Daemon on Sinophia, been resuscitated twice and had to spend a full year convalescing after terrible events on the ill-famed world of Dusk. It was this last horror that drove her over the edge.

Secretly for years she had bent her efforts to pursuing those like her—obsessed with death and immortality. She hunted down necro-cults and heretek vivisectors, destroyed them and keeping their secrets for herself to conduct blasphemous sorceries to conquer the grave. After an armed raid on the Genators of the Hippocrasian Agglomeration, she sparked a schism between the Mechanicus and the Holy Ordos that threatened outright conflict. Recalled to the Tricorn Palace on Scintilla to explain her actions, when she did return it was no more than a ruse, and using terrible and unguessed at sorceries and forbidden sciences, she struck, slaying several Inquisitors and scores of Acolytes before stealing several artefacts from the deep vaults and making her escape.

In response, the wrath of the Ordos was terrible to behold and, united in grief for the fallen and outrage at Erya's crime, it acted with single and terrible purpose. The pursuit lasted for fifteen years and left no stone unturned, regardless of the consequences. Erya and her agents were hounded from the Scarus Drift to the far side of the Hazeroth Abyss, and as she died for a final time, burning in the blaze of Witch Finder Rykehuss's inferno pistol, she swore she would yet rise again to avenge herself on the living. Her ashes now remain in a sealed vault in the depths of the Tricorn Palace.

on Tests to resist possession attacks. The jammer, however, has no effect on psychic attacks that inflict direct physical Damage.

Psykers cannot use psy-jammers (they naturally overload them).

#### **Psy-T racke r**

Sometimes referred to as aetherscopes, these are a particular form of scanner designed to monitor disturbances in the empyrean and detect and analyse psychic energies. These sophisticated and tricky devices are used extensively by adepts and savants attached to the Holy Ordos, although very similar scanners are actually used as a common part of the engineering equipment of major starships to monitor the status of the ship's Geller field and its generators.

The Tech Use skill is required to be able use one of these scanners. Awareness Tests taken in conjunction with the device enable the user to determine the presence and relative strength of psychic force, Daemons, the lingering effects of warp disturbances and the like. Psy-trackers are somewhat temperamental devices with an operating range of no more than a few hundred metres (although they might register very powerful spikes and signals from far beyond that). They are also easily clouded and confused by powerful energy fields and psychic "background noise".

#### **Psycannon Bolts**

A true psycannon is a highly advanced form of bolter weapon utilised by the legendary Grey Knights, and aside from their armouries and a few powerful members of the Ordo Malleus, it is extremely rare even among the ranks of the Inquisition. Psycannon bolts, however, utilise the same core of psy-anthaemic substance in their construction and are capable of ripping through warp-stuff and barriers of psychic force with ease. Shockingly fatal even to those without psychic powers, it is whispered by some that those slain by psycannon bolts have their souls snuffed out like guttering candles.

Psycannon bolts add +5 to all Critical Damage inflicted. Psycannon bolts inflict double their rolled Damage against targets with a Psy Rating, Daemons and other warp entities after Armour and Toughness Bonuses are taken into account. Damage inflicted by psycannon bolts is classed as Holy and ignores any psychically or warp-generated armour or protective field (such as Daemonic Resilience, Telekinetic Shield, etc).

Psycannon bolts are only ever obtainable from somebody with full Inquisitorial rank.

**Used with:** Bolt weapons.

# <span id="page-192-0"></span>An Inquisitorial Miscellany An Inq uisitorial Misce llany

*"All one has to do is look upon the face of the alien to know we are right. That every hatred and prejudice, every spite and fury that has coiled in man's heart since time began was put there for this single sacred purpose—to hate them and bring them death!"*

— Lord Inquisitor Nihilus, Collected Sermons of Monodominance Vol I, Part XI.

#### **The Calixian Black Grimoire**

Thought to have been first penned by the Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Lord Quate'maz Knael in the in the aftermath of his expeditions into the Hazeroth Abyss, and substantially added to a century later by the infamous Inquisitor Kol Shek, the Black Grimoire is no less than a field manual detailing many forms of xenos creatures they had encountered in their long years of service—explaining how to identify, combat

and destroy them. Kol Shek's numerous later entries, often considerably briefer and laid down in his distinctive and somewhat sensationalistic prose style, widen the work's scope to include xenophile cults, warp entities and a host of other unconnected horrors. The very existence of the Grimoire is a point of contention among the Calixian Conclave as most in the Ordo Malleus feel that such information should never leave the heavily guarded libraries of the Ordos, while more Puritan factions of the Hereticus claim that the work is far too dangerous to be allowed to exist at all, and all copies should be hunted down and purged (although this might have something to do with the somewhat disparaging remarks that Kol Shek makes about the witch hunters throughout).

The Grimoire takes the shape of a small black data-slate made of high-impact polyflex that opens in the fashion of a clasped book and also has a short-range audio and pict recording and a playback function. Their owners, in addition to numerous other safeties built into them, personally encrypt all copies of the Black Grimoire and the Grimoire self-immolates if opened by an individual not specified by its gene-lock, or if tampered with.

The Black Grimoire provides a +10 bonus on Research Tests involving Ciphers (Occult), Scholastic Lore (Legend) and Forbidden Lore (Cults, Daemonology, Warp and/or Xenos).

#### **Cherubim**

The bio-constructs known as Cherubim are of uncertain origin, but they are one of the few permitted examples of such biosculpted homunculi allowed within the Imperium. Taking the form most commonly resembling that of somewhat corpulent and unwholesome looking genderless children, they are also often implanted with augmetic feathery wings (and a grav generator) allowing limited flight. Cherubim are not truly alive at all and their synthesised, bloodless and waxen flesh needs neither to eat nor sleep and is fed from their internal power-cell. They are controlled by an augmented cortex and nervous system usually harvested from some lesser creature such as a simian, bird, swine or felid, and implanted with a set of programmed commands that allows them to perform some simple task such as copying text, fetching and carrying small items or tirelessly singing the Emperor's praises with augmetic vocal cords.

Outside the rarefied noble houses and Imperial hierarchy (most notably the Ecclesiarchy) where they are used, most citizens view Cherubim with a degree of distaste and superstitious fear. This is not entirely without cause as it is a matter of record that in rare instances Cherubim have been known to "devolve" allowing some corrupted and mangled version of their organic cortex to take over their behaviour with unpleasant consequences.

They flee if injured or startled, and left to their own devices they are indolent creatures, often perching in high places and simply watching until called for or set a task. Some might even regard them as sly, and stories flourish in noble households and churches of them filching small shiny objects and hiding them in the rafters.

#### **Drusine Incense**

Said to be rendered from a proscription laid down by the warrior-saint Drusus himself during the war-torn days of the Angevin Crusade, this incense—a mixture of myrrh, camphor, verdigris and the crushed blossoms of the rare Iocathine rose—is prepared ritually in the vaults of the Cathedral of Illumination in Hive Tarsus and is renowned for its powerful purifying effect. Highly valued by the faithful, Drusine incense is used in high masses and ceremonies of import across the Calixis Sector, and the Holy Ordos know that folk tales of the incense's ability to ward-off evil hold more than a grain of truth.

Drusine incense is a coarse reddish-gold crystalline powder burned in a self-heating metal censer suspended on chains called a thurible. The incense burned and dispersed in this creates a cloud up to three metres across. Within this cloud, characters with 10 or less Corruption Points are immune to the effects of the Daemonic Presence special rule. A single portion of incense burns for 1d10+20 minutes.

#### **Excruciator**

The contrary to popular reputation, the Inquisition frowns on crude physical coercion and torture, finding information extracted by such methods to be ultimately flawed and utterly unreliable, not to mention often entirely inadequate against those whose minds and bodies have been given over to dark forces. However, when direct interrogation is called for in extremis and more thorough methods (such as psychic probing) are unavailable, devices that induce mental discomfort, terror and illusory agonies though neural and chemical manipulation without uneedful injury are employed. The most common (and mobile) of these devices are known as excruciators, and consist of a variety of long monofilament induction needles and auto injectors linked to a control unit and a specially modified medicae auspex.

Using such a device requires a about an hour to set up on a subject (who must be restrained) and can only be employed by a character with both the Medicae and Tech-Use skills. The use of an excruciator adds a +20 bonus to Interrogation Tests for the questioner and a -10 penalty to Deceive Tests for the subject.

Individuals with the Fearless talent or From Beyond trait are immune to this device's effects.

#### **Icon of Holy Wrath**

There usually comes a time even in the most labyrinthine covert investigation, or ongoing deception by the Inquisition, when the facts have been gathered and the guilty identified. A time to punish and purify with all the awesome might and magisterial fury the Holy Ordos can muster. It is at these times that the Icon of Holy Wrath is displayed. Each icon differs, based on the traditions and tastes of the Inquisitors that own them. For some it will be an unfurled banner depicting the avenging visage of the Emperor himself, for others a sainted reliquary of martyr's bones or even the simple uncompromising symbol of the Ordos itself held aloft in a suspensor field. Not all Inquisitors use these icons but those that do either carry them into battle themselves or entrust them to a prominent Acolyte to carry in the forefront of battle as a sign to the corrupt and the fallen that their judgement is at hand.

The presence of the Icon of Holy Wrath enhances the character's visibility for the purpose of certain talents (Into the Jaws of Hell, for example). Additionally they give the bearer and their allies within six metres a rating of Fear (1 Disturbing), to cultists, mutants, heretics and anybody else the GM deems appropriate.

These icons cannot be bought, only fashioned appropriately by a full Inquisitor, and their use granted for a particular battle.

#### **Torpor**

Long used by the masters of the Black Ships to control their harvest of charges, torpor is a chemical cocktail of neural-inhibitors and narcotics deigned to render the subject docile and, more importantly, negate their ability to use Psychic Powers. Likewise the Holy Ordos maintains it own supplies of Torpor for prisoner control and other uses, while hereteks and some cults have been known to manufacture their somewhat unreliable version for their own dark purposes.

A single dose of torpor lasts for 1d10 minus the subject's Toughness Bonus in hours, during which time the subject is overcome by a grey anxiety-ridded haze in which he counts as Fatigued and must succeed in a Difficult (–20) Willpower Test to perform any Actions of his own volition. In addition, psychic characters have their Psy-Rating reduced by 4 while under this drug's effects.

### Chapter VIII: Religion & Superstition Chapter VIII: Religion & Superstition

*"…and his faith in the Emperor was both his shield and his sword…"*

— Except from *the First Book of Saint Drusus*.

The Imperium is a star-spanning empire, built upon the will of a single individual—the Emperor. He is both god and lord to uncounted billions across tens of thousands of light years of space. He stands above the highest of the Lords of Terra and has no equal. Belief in the Emperor is not an act of faith or a personal choice, but rather an irrefutable fact. The Emperor exists; it is through His efforts that the Imperium of Man endures. When a man looks up into a night sky filled with stars, he knows without question that he gazes upon the God-Emperor's domain. Nor does the Emperor tolerate those who do not offer Him worship. Either you are counted among His servants or you are marked as an enemy to all mankind and damned forever in His eyes. Delivering the word of the Emperor falls to the Ministorum, also known as the Ecclesiarcy or Cult of the Emperor, a vast cult that spans the galaxy. On almost every world in the Imperium, preachers, confessors and zealous missionaries spread His word and enforce His spiritual rule. Imperial citizens are raised to the sound of songs sung in His name and taught to venerate Him in all of their endeavours. The Emperor and the Imperium are one and the same; inextricably intertwined and dependant on each other for existence. T

This is the universe into which an Acolyte of the Inquisition is born. Whether base-born scum from the toxic depths of a hive world, a naked primitive who stares in wonder at the night sky or a scion of the Adeptus Mechanicus birthed from a vat, they are all born into the world of the God-Emperor. Growing up in such an environment is to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is the Emperor that keeps the dark of the void at bay. Of course, a lifetime of exposure to the worship of the Emperor and the wonder of His saints does not make every Acolyte a devout worshipper, though; there are few that would openly reject His divinity (well, few that have lived very long after expressing such opinions). For most Acolytes, their faith extends to a firm belief in the power of the Emperor. After all, the proof of His majesty is writ large wherever the Imperium extends. Beyond this, however, the Emperor is just another master, unseen, but ever watchful (much like the Inquisition). However, that being said, an Acolyte's line of work is somewhat risky, to say the least, and, like most who regularly place themselves in "harm's way", they tend to find solace in superstition. To this end, many Acolytes favour a saint (or many saints), invoking their names to "help" them accomplish their tasks. Even an Acolyte who scorns the endless prattle of a preacher will, more often than not, say a quick prayer to Vidicus the Saint of Forlorn Plans and tuck a stone-shard from the tomb of Drusus into his sleeve before leaping into the fray.

This chapter explores the role that the Ministorum, the saints and the worship of the God-Emperor play in an Acolyte's life. It delves into the myriad of ways in which the Emperor is revered and the various organisations and people that devote their lives to His service. It also reveals how, simultaneously, the followers of the Emperor of Mankind can be both resolutely unified and dangerously fractured in their faith—this last part being especially true for that manyarmed beast known as the Holy Inquisition. Here you will find information on how the Ministorum spreads the word of the Emperor and the process of bringing new worlds "into His light"—a task that Acolytes can sometimes find themselves involved in. Also of importance to Acolytes is a guide to rooting out heresy and heretical cults. Often the taint of corruption hides behind faith in the Emperor and only through the eternal vigilance of both the Inquisition and the Ministorum can such blasphemies be discovered and destroyed. Finally, contained herein is a list of saints, relics and pilgrimages to help Acolytes better observe their worship of the Emperor.

#### **Holy Days**

Every world in the Imperium (and often nations and communities on that world) observes its own set of holidays and religious festivals in the name of the Emperor. There are, however, a number of holidays common to many worlds in Calixis, though their time and the exact details of their execution still vary from world to world.

#### **Feast of the Emperor's Ascension**

This annual event is the most common festival held in the Emperor's name. It celebrates the moment, ten thousand years ago, when He was raised to the Golden Throne and made the transition to divinity. On many worlds this is a week-long event, with feasting, games and spectacles to honour the Emperor. Often symbolic sacrifices are made in His name, such as the burning of books to offer their knowledge up to Him. It is also an auspicious time to join people in wedlock or conceive children, leading to mass gatherings of citizens intent on one or both of these undertakings. It is also said that during the Emperor's Ascension, no false judgements can be made, making it impossible to overturn a ruling made during this time.

Not all worlds celebrate the Ascension with feasts and festivals. On some, especially primitive worlds, this holiday marks a time when the Emperor looks down from His divine realm and remembers His mortal followers. It is at this time that those brave and bold enough can earn a place at His side. Thus the Ascension becomes a bloody time when men and women fight and die in an effort to please the Emperor, each trying to outdo the courage and skill of the others.

However it is celebrated, the Feast of the Emperor's Ascension is the most notable Imperial holiday and the one that the majority of Imperial civilians observe, even if they do so only to gain a brief respite from their daily drudgery.

#### **Drusus Day**

Drusus is the patron saint of the Calixis Sector and is venerated first among the saints on dozens of worlds. It is unsurprising, then, that he has a day dedicated to his memory and his achievements. Celebrated at the turning of a planet's cycle, when it takes the first day of a new year, Drusus Day reminds people that "new beginnings" are the gift that Drusus brings. When he led his armies into the Calixis Sector and drove out the xenos and rebels, he brought with him the gift of brotherhood and unification from Terra. On this day, citizens, especially soldiers, renew their vows and oaths to the Golden Throne and all it stands for. Clerics too remind people of the saint's sacrifice and courage by putting on retellings of the crusade. In these stories, depending where the tale is told, each world often plays up its own importance, claiming that theirs was the first to be liberated or was the only one that rose up to aid the crusaders, or some equally fanciful twist. Drusus Day is a popular time for thousands of pilgrims to embark upon retracing the steps of the warriors of old.

#### **Festival of Saints**

Most saints have their own holy days that are specific to them and their deeds (such as Drusus). However, the Festival of Saints provides a day for all saints to be honoured, as well as a time when new saints may be considered to join their ranks. This is especially important for very minor saints, such as Yorgic Thrice-Branded or Ewerft the Handless, who have small followings and little power within the Ecclesiarchy. During this time, stories are told and devout followers try and convert people by extolling the virtues and merits of their chosen saint. As a result, it can be a dangerous (or at least frightening) time to go near to a shrine as citizens are accosted by frothing saint worshippers dressed in bizarre costumes and spouting proverbs. Causing an equally strong response is the chance of being raised to sainthood. While it is uncommon for anyone to be so bold as to try and claim that they themselves should become a saint (though there are a few that have tried—some with surprisingly good cases), everyone seems to know of someone who died serving the Emperor and thus deserves the eternal recognition of the Ecclesiarchy. As a result, clerics and priests are subjected to long lines of supplicants and must listen to countless hours of prattle to then judge whether any are worthy of the greater attention of the Ecclesiarchy. Needless to say, it almost never happens; the last saint raised in the Calixis Sector occurred some two centuries ago.

#### **Emperor's Gift**

Every planet in the Imperium owes loyalty and gives tithe to the Emperor. Whether this tithe is collected once every solar cycle or once every one hundred years, it is the first and most important responsibility that the Emperor demands of His subjects. Because of the importance of a planet's tithe, it has on many worlds become a sacred day known as the Emperor's Gift. On this day when millions of tonnes of ore, precious metals or foodstuff are borne skyward, citizens look up and give thanks to their contribution to the great work that is the Imperium. It is also on this day that a world offers up newly raised Guard regiments, fresh-faced soldiers who leave their world forever to serve the Emperor among the stars. These men or women spend the day of the Gift enjoying themselves and are refused very little by those they leave behind—in some places it is considered good luck to serve such soldiers before they depart. The Gift is also a time of fierce pride amongst citizens toward their world, making it dangerous to be an off-worlder, for slandering the name of a planet during the time of the Gift is almost guaranteed to start a fight. Some have speculated that it was, in fact, not the Ecclesiarchy but the Administratum that sanctioned this holiday. After all, how else could you hope to strip a planet of its wealth and leave it feeling good about it?

#### **The Burning of Sins**

Sin is a concept propagated by the Ministorum on every world it touches. It is the unconscious debt all citizens owe to the Emperor for the improper way in which they live their lives. Because most people feel bad about themselves most of the time, it is not hard for the Ministorum to convince them that they are sinners, and that they must somehow make amends. This was no doubt the logic behind the holiday known as the Burning of Sins. At this time people are allowed to absolve themselves of their wrong doings and transgressions against the Ecclesiarchy through a symbolic burning of their sins. Great bonfires are built before cathedrals and shrines, and citizens gather, clutching their sins written onto paper. Those who are brave enough can then come forward and let the presiding cleric or priest read aloud the sin and decide whether or not to grant forgiveness. If he does so, the sin is thrown into the fire and the citizen receives a blessing and permission to leave. If however, the sin is too great for such a simple "fix", then the citizen has a choice: they may either tithe the sin's monetary worth to the Ecclesiarchy, (a sum decided on by the cleric), or leap into the flames themselves.

### <span id="page-198-0"></span>A Dark Millennium A Dark Mille n n ium

*"Stand fast brothers! We are on the precipice, gazing into the void, with only His hand to stay our fall!"*

— Vorgrett Gors, preacher attached 117th Barsapine Light Foot.

I t is a dark time for the Imperium. Beset by foes within and without, it clings precariously to an empire grown large and fractious. For most, this means they are alone in the universe, never setting foot beyond their worlds (sometimes travelling no more than a few kilometres from the place of their birth), and never fully comprehending the great empire in which they live. For many, all that connects them with the galaxy-spanning brotherhood of man is the Cult of the Emperor, a divine being so great that it is said that without Him the human race would perish and vanish from the stars forever. Unlike many religions, however, this one is base solidly on truth. The Emperor does, in fact, protect and guide the Imperium. For it is the very "light" he projects through the warp from Terra, known as the Astronomican, that helps vessels to find their way in the warp across tens of thousands of light years. His was also the hand that forged the mighty Adeptus Astartes, whose legions carved out the Imperium and who, even now, stand watch over their master's domain. I

More important than the physical facts, though, is the idea of what the Emperor embodies. Nothing as vast or diverse as the Imperium could hope to survive through mere administration or law alone (though the Administratum would have you believe otherwise). Instead, it is the belief in the power and divinity of the Emperor that unites its citizens, a belief that has forged mankind into a single cultural identity. Even the most isolated of worlds can know that, from His Golden Throne on Holy Terra, the Emperor is watching them, guiding them and protecting them from the unspeakable terrors that haunt the darkness beyond.

#### **A Life of Worship** A Life of Worship

The Emperor has a profound effect in the lives of the people he protects. To most, He is everywhere and everything. Part of every citizen's life is to honour the Emperor, often on a daily basis, for the protection and guidance that He provides. How they honour Him, however, will of course vary depending on where they live and just how they choose to view the Emperor. For example, on the world of Acreage, the priests of the High King teach that the Emperor is the "King of the Sky"; sky-mill workers must keep there eyes averted from the heavens when they work high above the ground, lest they anger Him with their impudence. Villages often make "candle-balloons" in which to offer their prayers. On the mining world of Luggnum, the pit-shafts are so dangerous that all miners undertake hour-long blessings by the station abbot before they descend. Miners that have refused or avoided such blessings are scorned (or even killed) by their co-workers, lest they bring ill-luck to all, proving that perhaps the blessing does in fact protect from harm. Then there are worlds like Dwimlicht, a feral world far from the civilized core of the sector, where primitive locals see the Emperor as a mighty star-god and shave their heads so that at night He might look into their minds with His million eyes and see that they are faithful.

Whatever the world's particular teachings, almost universally, citizens pray before work, before meals and before downtime. They thank the Emperor for what they have and pray to Him for what they desire. As most citizens of the Imperium are poorly educated, often knowing only what they need to do their jobs, prayer and the teachings of the Ministorum are all they know of the galaxy or world beyond their homes. They often believe wholeheartedly that if they do not pray to the Emperor and follow the instructions of His clerics, they risk their very souls (a belief unfortunately justified on many worlds). Over time, citizens become entwined in the rituals of worship, so that daily prayers to the Emperor are as natural to them as breathing. For most, this is as far as they come in their religious observance, convinced of their faith, living and dying without ever questioning the Ministorum or the god it serves.

Of course there are those who stray from the path. Paying no more than lip service to the Imperial Creed, these people forget their faith (if indeed they ever had it) and instead choose to see the Emperor as a distant overlord, ruling an empire that He will never see from a state of neither death nor life. Such folk choose to live by their own set of morals and ethics, though usually they have little of either. On many advanced worlds these kinds of people thrive. Where the rise of technology has overshadowed spirituality and wonder, so too does it undermine the belief in a power greater than mankind. Such places can be breeding grounds for the faithless or for those that would scorn the power of the Emperor for more tangible and immediate rewards.

For many citizens, however, the truth is, as always, somewhere between fevered worship and the brink of heresy. Most citizens pray at their local shrine once a ten-cycle, and invoke the Emperor's name to protect them from evil; but beyond this they go about their daily lives like everybody else.

### <span id="page-199-0"></span>A Question of Faith A Question of Faith

J ust what your PC believes, when it comes to the Imperial Creed is up to you. All Acolytes have been raised in the shadow of the Cult of the Emperor and cannot doubt His influence and the power of the Imperium. However, deciding to accept or reject any of the myriad of nuances making up His religion, such as the stock placed in certain saints or the best way to interpret His will, is up to you to decide. The following questions may be used to help you round out your character's religious beliefs. J

#### **How was the Emperor revered on your home world?**

The worship of the Emperor varies greatly from world to world and, quite often different cultures focus on a key aspect of His power. For instance, on an agri-world it might be the grace of the Emperor that protects and nurtures their crops and villages, while keeping them safe in the night. Hence the population would view Him as a benevolent figure that guides and shelters them. Alternatively on a penal world, the Emperor is a harsh judge and overseer who weighs your every deed and strikes you down if you are found wanting. Here the population would view Him as an unquestionable overlord to be obeyed and feared. These various experiences colour how you see the Emperor and His role in your character's life; even though your circumstances may have now changed, you remember the mighty Star-God or glowering statues of your childhood.

#### **Were there any saints on your home world?**

Many worlds have their own saints, whether sanctioned by the Ecclesiarchy or not. This helps people to better relate to the Emperor and His Creed. After all, at one time or another, saints were humans who lived, struggled and died in His name. If your character grew up on a world where the Ecclesiarchy was strong, it is likely that he or she would have also been taught about some of the many saints of the Imperium and be able to name each of the twenty-three trials of Quirdas, or tell the story of Kinorr the Pure and the three-armed Ork for instance. You would also have been taught about any local saints, such as the founder of your world (provided he was not a foul traitor who resisted the Imperium in any way). All this, of course, is not to say that a character born far from the schooling of the Ecclesiarchy could not come from a world blessed by saints. In many primitive cultures, for instance, the first warrior to approach the skyship when it landed is credited for "welcoming" the Emperor to their world (whether he got a bolt shell for his troubles or not).

#### **Are there any saints that you personally identify with?**

Where the Cult of the Emperor is strong, so too is the influence of its saints. On such devout worlds, when a child first receives the blessing of the Emperor it is not uncommon for the residing cleric to choose a saint to watch over the infant, sometimes adding the saint's name to that of the child. These guardian saints are said to follow the person through his life, helping him to overcome his problems and finally, when he dies, usher him into the Emperor's light. Sometimes, people come to have a guardian saint through other means, such as a man who nearly drowns taking up the worship of Epps the Unwell, saint of dangerous environments, for example. So it is possible, either though his upbringing or a chance event, that your character may have a very close relationship with one or more saints, praying to them regularly and looking to them for guidance in times of need.

#### **How do you believe people should best serve the Emperor?**

The people of the Imperium are often taught that they serve the Emperor in everything they do, whether it is vanquishing His foes or cleaning bilges on His cargo ships. However, most citizens of the Imperium believe that certain tasks please the Emperor more than others. For example, many believe that there is no greater service to the Emperor than killing His foes, be they aliens, heretics or witches. These people claim that His favour can only be found by wading through a sea of xenos blood. Others extol the virtues of self-deprivation and abstinence, claiming that the true light of the Emperor can only be found within our frail mortal shell. These folk suggest fasting and flagellating as the means to seek His grace. Some believe that what the Emperor truly desires is souls to cry out His name in worship, demanding that His word be spread to new worlds in order to turn unbelievers from their wicked ways and into His light. Of course it can be all of these or none, and ultimately it is up to you to choose just what your character believes.

#### **What do you believe will happen when you die?**

The Imperium is a violent, perilous place where life is cheap and death is common. For citizens on even the most stable and safe of worlds, most expect a lifetime of toil that leads to an unmarked grave. For this reason, the Ministorum teaches that, through service and sacrifice to the Emperor, the faithful can find eternal peace beyond the gates of death. For many, it is enough to know that no matter how terrible their lives or the drudgery of their days, this reward awaits them. Some, however, know more than they care to about the nature of the universe and the things lurking beyond the veil of death. Acolytes often know or have seen things that can alter their perception of death and what lies beyond, all of which is tied closely to their religious outlook. It is possible that every action your character makes is a step along the path to his eternal reward at the Emperor's side, or perhaps your Acolyte has seen too much and knows that all they have to look forward to is the chilling madness of the warp. In either case, with such a risky occupation, your character's feelings about death can have a profound effect on his personality and how he reacts to others.

#### **How has the Ministorum affected your life?**

Finally, the most important aspect about how your character feels about the Ecclesiarchy and the worship of the Emperor comes down to how he or she was treated by those that claim to work in His name. Perhaps he was treated well by the faith, raised by caring, if strict, abbots and clerics of the Schola Progenium and he views all those who wear the mantle of the Ministorum with respect and obedience. On the other hand, your character might have seen his family and friends put to the torch for trivial crimes in the name of the Emperor by corrupt and cruel confessors, leaving him with a deep distrust of those who claim to work in His holy name. This can be made more complicated by the fact that the Ministorum is often at odds with itself, and, like the Inquisition, there are equal amounts of the faithful and the flawed in its ranks.

# <span id="page-200-0"></span>Imperial Cults Imp erial Cults

*"No, no, the Sons of Sol are those chaps in the golden hoods; the Sons of Sept are the ones who paint their fingers and toes blue."* — Conversation between two merchants during the Festival of Saints, Scintilla.

Within the sprawling infrastructure of the Ministorum there are countless factions, philosophies and fraternities all striving to worship the Emperor in their own unique way. These groups gather about themselves followers, power and influence and have become "cults". A cult is simply a particular brand of Emperor worship that has the sanctioning of the Ecclesiarchy. They come about most commonly for two reasons. Firstly, when the Ministorum brings a new world into the fold of the Imperium and absorbs the local religion (allowing the natives to retain their holy days, rites and customs in exchange for supplanting their god(s) with the Emperor). Thus a new cult is formed, with its very own set of rules, rituals and saints. W

The second instance occurs when a (rare) individual arises whose deeds in the name of the Emperor become legend and inspires others to follow in his footsteps. Such an occurrence requires careful scrutiny by the Ecclesiarchy to determine whether or not such an individual's motives and practices were "pure". In many cases, whether such sanctioning is granted or not, the individual becomes the focus of a cult, who attempt to emulate their idol in an effort to better serve the Emperor. However they form, cults can wield great

power within the Ecclesiarchy and, by extension, across the Imperium. Belonging to the right cult can mean favour and status, just as belonging to the wrong cult can get you killed. Cults bring both stability and discord to the Ministorum. They create the former by bringing together millions of souls in to the light of the Emperor. By allowing cultures to retain the comfort and familiarity of their old faith in the form of a cult, the Ministorum unites men and women who have little in common beyond a genetic ancestry. As a result, all Imperial cults are one because they all worship the Emperor. Such diversity, however, can also cause internal conflict and strife. Many cults clash over small nuisances of faith, such as disagreeing over which foot to lead with when entering a shrine, lest the Emperor become angered by being presented with a "lesser" soul. The results of these altercations can range from small local affairs, limited to heated arguments and sly politically manoeuvring, to planet or system-wide pogroms being enacted against a particular cult. At any one time, it is likely that dozens of cults across a sector are engaged in some form of conflict, often resulting in open warfare. The Ministorum only steps into such conflicts if they either threaten the stability of the Imperium (which is to say it threatens to delay or reduce a planetary tithe), or if it strays into heretical thinking. Otherwise, they are content to let cults settle their differences as they see fit, as long as they do so in the name of the Emperor.

Beyond facilitating variant peoples to worship the Emperor, cults are also an avenue of attack for those that would seek to subvert and destroy the Imperium. Tragically, the abundance of cults is a breeding ground for such foul and dark practices as xenos worship and veneration of the Ruinous Powers. Under the guise of revering the Emperor, such groups can spread and prosper unnoticed. This can make it difficult to tell the difference between a cult that is sincere in its devotion to the Emperor and one that hides a festering heart of heresy. Of course this is where the Inquisition comes in…

#### **Calixian Cults** Calixian Cults

There are many sanctioned cults within the Calixis Sector, some of which boast considerable wealth and power, as well as a prestigious membership. It is almost certain that some of these are known to Acolytes, either because of the cult's reputation (whether fair or foul) or because of its influence within the Ministorum. Some may even become allies or patrons to Acolytes in the course of their Inquisitorial duties, though, it is often difficult to tell whether such aid is for the good of the Imperium, or the good of the cult. Listed here is a selection of cults that thrive within the sector.

#### **Drusians**

The Drusians were among the first of the Calixian cults to gain official recognition by the Ministorum. Formed in the wake of Drusus's rise to sainthood, it quickly spread across the sector and it is said that even Cardinal Ignato himself is counted among its numbers. The purpose of the cult is simple: to continue the great work of Drusus through the tightening of Imperial control within the Calixis Sector. Only through total dominance of the sector can Drusus's memory be properly honoured and his dream of total conquest realised. Drusian cultists teach that bravery and sacrifice in the Emperor's name is paramount. Those not willing to give their lives for the Emperor are unworthy to receive His blessing. Likewise, to refuse to battle the enemies of the Imperium, or worse yet, make common cause with them, is an unforgivable and irredeemable sin.

The cult's most important holy day is, unsurprising, Drusus Day. Cult members must gather and proclaim deeds done in the saint's name for the year past. The cult primarily attracts soldiers and other martially-orientated individuals, though it is open to anyone who would kneel before the statue of the saint and vow to continue his work. The cult's symbol is the Blade of Drusus, a curved silver chainsword.

#### **The Vitrian Covenant**

Like much of the rest of the Imperium, the Calixis Sector is touched by the green-plague: Orks. Whilst Calixis has, so far, been fortunate to have avoided a full scale invasion, there are pockets of feral Orks infesting the deep wilds of certain feral worlds, as well as, their more "advanced" cousins who have appeared to threaten numerous outposts and colonies. Orks are the focus of the Vitrian Covenant, a cult formed with the imperative of destroying these hated aliens. Vitrian was a confessor who fought alongside the Heronoris 88th in the 4th Epocanus Crusade. Just before the final defence of Spire City against the Obsidian Tooth Orks, Vitrian gave a speech to the soldiers, declaring a promise that, if the Emperor gave them victory, he would not to rest until all Orks had been purged from Calixis. Against the odds, the Orks were repelled and destroyed, thus the Covenant was forged. Though Vitrian was killed during the battle, the survivors went on to spread the word. Many men and women who had had their lives destroyed by Orks joined, all united in ending the alien menace within the sector.

The cult works on two levels. The first are those who tell the story of the Battle of the Spire, and how the Emperor sent to them a message of their final triumph in that victory. These members also seek out war zones where Orks are being fought to take an active roll in the destruction of the xenos. The second are those who move behind the scenes, using the cult's finances to help fund enterprises and campaigns that lead to the destruction of Orks. These cultists also engage in political manoeuvring to get more Imperial resources diverted to eradicate the Orks and try and gain support to launch new military campaigns into known Ork territory.

As a martial cult, the Vitrian Covenant honours the holy days of warrior saints, including Drusus, especially those that won great battles against the greenskins. They have also been known to stage great symbolic Ork sacrifices during the Feast of the Emperor's Ascension. On more civilized worlds, this is usually the burning of effigies or the killing of criminals painted green, though in some places actual Orks are used (though they are usually battlefield dead). The membership of the cult varies widely, though most have had some part of their life affected by Orks. This could be as traumatic as the loss of a loved one or as trivial as having the

supply of your favourite cheese interrupted by an Ork raid on Imperial shipping. Whatever the case, all cult members passionately hate Orks. The cult's symbol is a flaming spire, commemorating the formation of the Covenant.

#### **Sisters of the Void**

This benevolent all-female cult spends much of its time plying the space-routes between worlds, helping travellers and crew to deal with the stresses of the warp. Formed unofficially as a group of clerics and priests to help travellers, they were eventually recognised and sanctioned by the Ecclesiarchy. Since that time, their numbers have continued to swell. The Sisters can mostly be found on pilgrim trails, though, there is a chance of encountering them on any Imperial vessel. Few captains would refuse passage to a Sister and most crews readily welcome their presence. No one knows why the cult only allows female members, although it has been rumoured that it has something to do with the nature of warp travel. There is an old, though unproven, belief that women can cope better with this kind of travel, their minds being more resilient to its inherent dangers. In any case, few males would probably be interested in joining what they see as a nonmilitant cult of "nurses".

The cult has no saints of its own, though it does revere holy days that reflect its beliefs. The cult attracts strong women, from all strata of society, who have decided to leave their lives behind to help others. A large proportion of the cult is

made up of void born, many of whom have grow up with the Sisters in their midst. The symbol of the cult is a black disk, representing the emptiness of space. It is worth noting that, unlike most cults that have shrines on many worlds and large central churches from where the cult is governed, the Sisters have but a single shrine. This can be found on the Misericord and acts as the single official meeting place for the Sisters of the Void.

#### **The Redemption**

The Redemption is an extreme faction of the Ministorum found in many parts of the Imperium. Depending on whom you ask, it is either described as a refuge for bloodthirsty zealots and madmen, or the last true cult of the Emperor. This split view springs from the fact that the members of the Redemption are ultra-puritanical in their execution of what they perceive as the Emperor's will. They pride themselves on hunting down and expunging mutants, psykers and heretics with no respite and no quarter. They are also very fond of fire.

To belong to the Redemption is to embark on a lifelong quest to purge the Imperium of taint, usually through the most violent means possible. After all, the Redemption teaches that there are no half measures. The cult is also much easier to join than it is to leave, as many cultists take a very dim view of those that would "betray" the Emperor in such a way. Redemptionists, as they are commonly known, have been known to turn on their own at the slightest hint of taint, tearing them to bits and burning the remains.

The cult only observes the holy days of the Emperor, who they see as the only true power in the Imperium. They are distrustful of other cults and saints, always suspecting them of corruption and treachery. The cult's membership is made up mostly of the poor, downtrodden and illiterate masses of the Imperium who find within its ranks a sense of power and purpose. These unflagging soldiers of faith are led by dangerous and charismatic individuals, driven by their devotion to the Emperor. The Redemption has many symbols throughout the Imperium, though within the Calixis Sector the most common is the sign of crossed torches.

#### **Belonging to a Cult**

Many Acolytes were once part of, or still belong to, a variant cult of Emperor worship. This could be because of the world on which they were born, the nature of their profession or the result of a life-changing event. Whatever the case, being part of a cult often marks one for life, becoming an important part of the Acolyte's identity and often imposing upon them a code of behaviour and conduct. This can sometimes create a conflict of interest where the Acolyte's cult requires them to do one thing, while their Inquisitor requires them to do another. Fortunately, such occurrences are rare, and Inquisitors are careful to recruit Acolytes whose beliefs and motivations harmonise with their own. Far more likely is that the cult an Acolyte's Inquisitor belongs to influences his decisions, and by extension, his Acolytes.

Some of the common commitments that come with being part of a cult can include such things as giving tithes, observing special rituals or holy days, attending cult gatherings or making contact with local cult members when travelling and spreading the word of the cult, whether overtly or covertly.

The first of these is probably the most important; after all, without the tithes and gifts of the cult members many cults could not exist. While money is always an accepted method of showing one's devotion to a cult, those with special talents or privilege can show it in other ways. This is especially true of Acolytes whose relative freedom within the structures of Imperial society allow them access denied to most citizenry. Thus an Acolyte may be called upon to deliver messages, check up on wayward cult members or seek out new converts in their travels. Other sacrifices may also be required in place of a monetary tithe. These can include anything from information gathering to offering up friends and family members to serve the cult. Whatever the case, few cult members resent these tithes, as they seem them as simply part of their greater devotion to the Emperor.

The observance of certain rituals and rites is another part of belonging to a cult. While outsiders may view such things as unusual dress, erratic sleeping habits and eccentricities, these are solemn duties for a cult member. To spurn such rites is to display a lack of conviction in one's beliefs and, by extension, a lack of faith in the cult. Marking holy days is also a part of a cultist's duty. This can sometimes be tricky for individuals such as Acolytes who find themselves travelling from world to world, where cycles, seasons and years can vary wildly. The usual practice to get around this is to keep a personal time, marking the days by the Acolyte's own waking and sleeping. In any event, a holy day takes precedent over most things that the Acolyte does that day, and can sometimes lead to them refusing to travel, fight or engage in social behaviour until it has passed.

It is also required of a cultist to make contact and common cause with other cultists wherever they travel. Likewise, an Acolyte cultist should be able to call upon the cult if in need. The reality of this, however, is that a cultist inevitably ends up doing far more for the cult than it does for him. Of course if he truly believes in the cult's teachings, he won't mind. This can cause problems for Acolytes, who might find themselves drawn into local disputes and conflicts. While most cults respect the work of the Inquisition and leave Acolytes to do their holy duty, some are not above using an Acolyte's position to their own ends. At this point, it falls to the Acolyte to decide whether aiding the local cultists is worth the trouble it might cause.

As should be apparent, being a "good" cultist is a lot of work and only those Acolytes who really want to belong to a cult should consider joining one.

### <span id="page-204-0"></span>The Word of the Emperor The Word of the Emp eror

*"The Emperor's light can reach every corner of this galaxy, so long as we bear his torch."*

— Pax Missionary Flestin Drunn.

The Ecclesiarchy never stops spreading the teaching of the Emperor. It is a faith constantly expanding, growing and spreading on the heels of the Imperium's armies. Not counting those worlds soiled by aliens or incapable of supporting life, there are countless worlds where humanity has taken root but has lost contact with the Imperium. Often these places fall to barbarism and the worship of heathen gods, isolated and alone as they are in a hostile universe. When such a world is discovered, the Ministorum is among the first to make contact, ensuring that the local population embraces the glory of the Emperor. They are also vital in weeding out heresy among the inhabitants and deciding whether or not they are a worthy addition to the Imperium. In some cases, a population is irredeemable and must be purged, so that the world can be resettled with "good" stock. Even after a world has accepted the rule and worship of the Emperor, complete conversion of the population can take many years. Whole arms of the Ministorum are dedicated to this task and travel from world to world, ensuring the faith of local populations. T

#### **New Worlds** New Worlds

When a new world is identified, the Administratum records its position and reviews its worth based on the information at hand. While some worlds are discovered by Imperial explorator fleets, most are chanced upon by individual vessels such as Rogue Traders and other questionable characters. Initial information about the new world can be sketchy at best or misleading at worst. More than one Rogue Trader has concealed the location or details of a planet so they might exploit it themselves. In any case, once the Administratum has properly processed the information available, a task that can sometimes take years given the thousands of worlds discovered within the Imperium each year, they issue it a priority. This is an order that allows other arms of the Imperium to decide whether or not the planet is worth their notice. If the world appears to have a human population, the Ministorum becomes involved.

The next step when such a world has been identified is to conduct a high-orbit survey. This allows data to be gathered, such as the technology level of the world, basic geography and a list of its abundant resources. Depending on the sophistication of the populace, this may be the point where they become aware of Imperial presence. When this is the case, one of two things occur: they concede to the will of the Imperium, or they resist. In the latter case, Imperial forces are swift and brutal in the suppression of such dissent, crushing it utterly. If this occurs, or the inhabitants remain unaware of the gaze of the Imperium, then things move along to the next step.

Now the Ministorum arrives in full force, hundreds of missionaries and thousands of lesser Ecclesiarchy servants descend upon the world. Their task is to educate the populace and instruct them in the worship of the Emperor. They are also there to delve into the planet's culture and history to examine it for signs of taint. Typically, they start with the world's leaders, kings, governors and dictators. Turning them to the cult makes it easier to sway their subjects. They subvert local beliefs and religions, either by integrating them into the Ministorum as a cult of Emperor worship or by outlawing them as heresy. Over time, the population is taught that they have always been servants of the Emperor and the gods they once worshiped have been "echoes" of His great cult all along.

Dealing with Heresy

Acolytes sometimes play a role in this part of a world's integration into the Imperium. Called upon by the Inquisition, they arrive disguised as settlers or traders and integrate themselves inside the communities. They explore the culture and the planet, often travelling to remote areas in search of the stain of heresy and sedition.

### The Taint of Heresy The Tain t of Heresy

#### *"My first clue? Well the tentacles were a tip-off."*

I

— Confessor Crexus. n its simplest terms, heresy is anything that contravenes the worship of the Emperor or goes against the Imperium. Because the Emperor is not just a ruler—He is a god, to take up arms against Him or His followers is more than treason, it is heresy. Thus all enemies of the Imperium can also be deemed "heretics". Of course this is not always the case, as the Ministorum seldom marks people as heretics for trying to throw off the yoke of Imperial rule or killing a Guardsman. These are simply rebels and, though their deeds may hide the taint of heresy, they are usually dealt with by more conventional forces. The Ecclesiarchy is more interested in those that not only reject the Emperor, but also embrace something else in His place. These slaves and servants to alien and warp entities are viewed as true heretics and their discovery and eradication is a prime I

goal of the Ministorum throughout the Imperium. Finding such heretics can, however, be a difficult task. Amidst the thousands of Imperial cults and saints, it is easy for seemingly faithful practises to mask heretical deeds. To a certain degree, the Ministorum polices its own ranks against this corruption, but it is an impossible task keeping tabs on a cult that spans tens of thousands of light years and countless worlds. Even those who obviously seem to bear taint are not always guilty. Psykers and mutants, for instance, are two groups that often bear the suspicion of heresy, sometimes unfairly, sometimes not. While it would be convenient to brand all of these individuals as an affront to the Emperor and a scourge upon the Imperium, they are far too integrated into Imperial society to purge them wholesale.

<span id="page-205-0"></span>As a result, the Ministorum and other Imperial forces such as the Inquisition, must rely on investigation and intelligence gathering. Planets and their populations must be watched and monitored for signs of taint. Saints and cults must be screened and rumours of dark deeds investigated.

#### **Dealing with Heresy** Dealing with Heresy

Acolytes often find themselves presented with the question of whether or not someone or something is heretical. Though by the time they have become involved, there is a good chance that something foul is afoot. In any case, they must still try and identify the true heretics from the simply malcontent. It is taught that there are three stages to the identification and eradication of heresy. These are suspicion, investigation and purging.

#### **Suspicion**

Often the only clue an Acolyte has to the presence of heresy is through his instincts. The Ecclesiarchy and the Inquisition both encourage investigators to follow these feelings, believing it is the will of the Emperor guiding them to His enemies. This, combined with the broad powers of an organisation like the Inquisition, means that few people are safe from scrutiny when it comes to the rooting out of heretical behaviour. Acolytes are taught that no one and nothing should be above their suspicion, which can lead to them becoming extremely paranoid, another "virtue" encouraged by the Inquisition.

#### **Calixian Heresies**

#### **The Umbrian Heresy**

Deep in the Drusus Marches lies the world of Spectoris. An ocean planet, its surface almost completely covered by waves, its inhabitants farm the sea and export their bounty to surrounding planets and systems. Years ago it is recorded that a cult rose on the world of Spectoris, which worshipped the Emperor in His aspect as a mighty sea god, dwelling deep beneath the waters. The cult would sail out to places where the ocean grew deep and throw sacrifices into the sea. As the cult grew in power so too did its practices darken and whispers of human sacrifice and other blood rituals abounded. Eventually the Ecclesiarchy intervened, and though they lost several agents in their investigations, the cult was unmasked. It was revealed that they worshipped a xenos being known as the Umbrian, which lived in the deepest of the world's ocean trenches. After a violent conflict, both above and beneath the waves, the creature, its children and many of its human followers were destroyed. As a precautionary measure, all marine life not essential to food production was purged. Rumours still persist, however, that all of the Umbrian's children were not found and some of the creatures live still in the deep waters of Spectoris, waiting and watching for the time when they shall rise again.

#### **A Halo of Darkness**

The Calixis Sector sits close to the galactic rim, bordered by the Halo Stars. It is said that those who cross the rim seldom return the same. Out in the darkness of the void, beyond the gaze of the God-Emperor, things inhuman and unimaginable are said to dwell. Recently, the Ordos Calixis uncovered an organisation calling itself the "Halo of Darkness" that transported people beyond the rim and returned them somehow "changed". The cult appeared to be made up of a cabal of ship captains, some even holding ranks within the Imperial Navy, which would take hundreds of people out to unknown destinations within the Halo Stars. They would then return these people to their lives, though altered somehow and evidently not "themselves". Fearing some kind of xenos infiltration of the sector, the Inquisition moved quickly and smashed apart the Halo of Darkness. Unfortunately the Inquisitorial agents were unable to discover the cult's destinations within that forbidding area of space. Some within the Ordos say the purge moved too quickly and vital clues were lost, whilst others argue that by moving as quickly as they did a terrible disaster was narrowly averted. Whatever the case, the search for those individuals "touched" by the organisation and the true power behind the cult continues.

#### **Investigation**

Once a target has been identified, the next step is to begin an investigation. In many cases, especially within the ranks of the Inquisition, the gathering of evidence is secondary to identifying guilty parties. Such clues are more to help lead the investigator to his quarry rather than prove anything in particular once he gets there. Because it is vital the heretics be discovered, the most important aspect of many investigations becomes stealth. Quite often, even the hint of Acolytes nosing around sends cultists underground, vanishing into the general populace and becoming practically impossible to find. As a result, the Inquisition especially advocates striking against heretics as soon as possible, even when there is only the most circumstantial of evidence. In the end, any number of innocent deaths is acceptable if it means a true heretic is found and destroyed.

#### **Purging**

Once the heresy has been unmasked the next step is to eradicate it. This can be harder than it seems, as, like weeds, many heretical cults can appear to be destroyed only to spring up once more. The teaching of the Ecclesiarchy and the Inquisition on this matter is clear—the Emperor rewards thoroughness. If there is the slightest suspicion of involvement in the heresy, they must be purged. Sometimes the heresy has consumed an entire hive or continent, and the Ecclesiarchy cannot be so discerning as to single out individuals. At this point, the Ministorum shows no mercy and offers no quarter, leading to the destruction of entire cities or even worlds through military conflict, atomic fire or virus bomb. Better a dead world than one that does not bow to the Emperor.

# The Holy The Holy

<span id="page-206-0"></span>*"Though they did flay her body with their blades, rend her bones to dust with their fists and consume her organs with their hungry maws, they possessed nothing that could touch her faith."*

— Excerpt from the Blessed Suffering of Saint Elana.

The Calixis Sector is full of saints, men and women who have given their lives to the glory of the Emperor. Some are very minor, only revered in a single city or town, while some can be found wherever Imperial rule extends. Large or small, saints form the human face of the Ministorum, giving worshippers something to relate to and aspire toward. Saints are also often associated with certain aspects and particular causes, such as stellar travel or guilt. Some saints are even more specialised, watching out for those that work with ill-tempered Grox for example. This means, regardless of your situation, there is always a saint watching over you and to whom you can offer a prayer of protection. The truly devout take no chances and festoon themselves with the symbols and tokens of many saints. Saints also have a prominent place in Imperial culture beyond their religious connotations. Their names can be found on everything from worlds and stellar craft to streets and children. Often something that is akin to a saint's cause bears their name, such as a warship called the Saint Drusus (of which there are one hundred and thirteen so named to date), so it might embody some of the fierceness of its namesake. Taking all of this into account, saints form an important part of a citizen's life, as prolific and ever-present as the Cult of the Emperor itself. T

#### **Drusus the Warrior**

Without a doubt the greatest of all the saints within the Calixis Sector, Drusus stands at the right hand of the Emperor in the hearts and minds of most Calixian citizenry. From early childhood, millions are taught the tales of the great general Drusus and his relentless armies. They learn of how he brought the light of the Emperor back to the sector and swept away the vile masses of xenos who had taken root. It is because of his efforts that the Calixis Sector exists today. The Ministorum makes sure that no one forgets his deeds and, wherever temples and shrines to the Emperor are raised, so too are statues of this saint. Likewise, few saints can boast a cult as large or powerful as Drusus and none can deny the influence that the cult has over all Calixian affairs.

Though a mighty and cunning warlord, Drusus is best remembered and revered as an honest and courageous warrior. It is this purity of faith in the Emperor and the Imperium that soldiers will pray to before heading into battle. To invoke the name of Drusus is to ask for the righteous might of the Emperor to guide your hand. On some worlds entire regiments of Guardsmen are dedicated to the saint's name, such as the 23rd Drusus Dragoons of Clove, who spend their days in prayer to the saint when they are not battling the enemies of the Imperium. Many combat training facilities have a likeness of the saint above their entrance and cadets are required to ask Drusus for his blessing before they enter.

The greatest shrine to Drusus can be found within the Cathedral of Illumination on Scintilla. This is also the headquarters of his cult, where his followers gather from across the sector to discuss cult business. It is also the place where prospective cultists are brought to pledge their devotion to the saint, often in mass blessings many thousand strong. Within the cult, Drusus is second only to the Emperor and comes even before the leaders of the Ecclesiarchy. Of equal importance to the grand shrine on Scintilla is Maccabeus Quintus, sight of the near death of Drusus during the Angevin Crusade. Then there is Sentinel, an obscure shrine world, located in the Drusus Marches. Exactly why the world is holy to the saint is unclear; thousands make the pilgrimage there, often to die in the shadow of Drusus's monument. It is also important to the cult, and any who would rise to the higher ranks within it must travel to the world and ask the saint's blessing. Due to the dangers involved, reaching the world and returning safely is usually considered as "proof " of the saint's favour.

#### **Vidicus the Forlorn**

Vidicus lived many hundreds of years ago and had a life plagued with misfortune and disaster. According to the tales, he was a Rogue Trader—unusual stock for a saint. He is said to have explored great areas of the sector single-handedly, pushing back its boundaries. During this time, it is said he was a greedy and petty man, who sought only to exploit the worlds he discovered and expand his wealth and power. Like many men in such stories, an unfortunate event taught him the error of his ways and brought him into the light of the Emperor. In Vidicus's case it was the abduction of his daughter by alien pirates. He became driven to find her and scoured the sector in his search. He also turned completely to the worship of the Emperor and beseeched him for His guidance. What Vidicus received, however, was one disaster after another. First, his crew tried to mutiny and he was forced to lure them into a hold and vent them to the void. Then, his ship became lost in the warp and he was almost overcome by madness before he could return to realspace. Later, he was captured by Orks and only escaped by eating his own hands in an effort to impress his captors. The tales of Vidicus's quest for his daughter are long and numerous; however, they have two important morals. The first is that no matter how forlorn the hope that he would ever see his daughter again, he never stopped searching. The second is that no matter what adversities the galaxy threw at him, he never lost faith in guidance of the Emperor. Years after Vidicus had vanished in his quest to find his daughter (whose name has oddly never been recorded), a group of clerics wrote an exhaustive treatise on his journeys and deeds. It was from this that the Ministorum recognised his deeds and devotion to the Emperor and raised him to sainthood. Even today there are few worlds in the Calixis Sector that do not have a tale of Vidicus and the time he visited their world seeking his lost child.

Though he has no cult, Vidicus has many worshippers. Most people have been touched by tragedy at one time or another or have embarked on a risky or foolish course of action. At these times, they look to Saint Vidicus to preserve them and give them hope. Likewise his shrines can be found throughout the sector, often tucked away in the corners of larger cathedrals, littered with small offerings and prayers. Travellers also often pray to him to guide them safely to their destinations and makeshift shrines exist to him on many vessels. The saint's name also appears in many common phrases such as, "a Vidicus hope", meaning something with a very small chance of success, or "following Vidicus", meaning to obsess about something unattainable. Acolytes have also been known to invoke the name of Vidicus in their missions, sometimes scratching prayers to the saint on the inside of their armour. It is often joked (though out of earshot of any Inquisitors) that Vidicus would have made a good Acolyte.

#### **Rybel Gorth the Watcher in the Dark**

Rybel Gorth is unusual among saints because in life he was a psyker. Shunned by the Ecclesiarchy at the time and held in deep suspicion by much of Imperial society, Gorth was seen as a "necessary" second-class citizen. It is written that in his early life he worked aboard a warp-faring vessel, aiding the Navigator and helping to protect its passengers and crew. His story begins, however, during the evacuation of Canopus during the Heresy of Numbers. At this time, the world was being turned to ashes by bitter civil war and a great army of heretics had turned upon the Ecclesiarchy. Formerly a haven for religious learning and scholarly study, Sylor was filled with thousands of prominent and learned members of the Ecclesiarchy. Rybel Gorth's ship was the only one to reach the world before the end and took aboard hundreds of Ministorum officials and scholars before making a hasty retreat into the warp. Tragically, however, the ship became lost in the warp and years dragged by as it searched for escape. During this time, the crew and passengers began to die. Fearing the loss of the wealth of knowledge he had been part of rescuing, Gorth used his powers to draw out and store the minds of those who died, keeping them safe within his own. When the ship finally broke free and found its way to safe harbour, Gorth was half mad with a brain brimming with a hundred minds. Before he died, he transcribed the gathered knowledge of the scholars of Canopus, ensuring its survival. For his sacrifice, the Ecclesiarchy at the time blessed his memory and raised him to sainthood.

Rybel Gorth has few shrines and statues erected in his honour. Even now, centuries after his death, a certain distaste of him exists within the Ministorum. Even the majority of citizens who know of him, see him more as a malevolent presence rather than a source of comfort and guidance. They associate their fears about psykers and the warp with the saint, seeing him as the embodiment of this evil. There are those, however, that do not have their vision clouded by such fears. These are mostly scholars, adepts and, of course, psykers. These people see Gorth for what he was—a powerful psyker who was able to use his gift to hold the warp at bay and keep safe those around him. He has become a protector of those who would deal with the forbidden and the unknown, especially psykers who try and divine secrets from the warp or use it to send messages across the stars. Psykers often say prayers to Rybel Gorth when they use their powers, hoping that he will protect them from the perils of the warp. Scholars

who seek ancient secrets also pray to him lest they unearth or awaken the unnatural. The tale of Rybel Gorth is also often taught to Imperial psykers during their training, impressing upon them the importance of their devotion to the Emperor and the Imperium.

#### **Quivvar Nog of Fedrid**

Few primitives have ever achieved sainthood, though Quivvar Nog is one of the rare exceptions. Hailing from the feral world of Fedrid, he was a warrior of one of the great plains tribes who told stories of long ago, when men were star-walkers. It is said he was present to witness the first failed attempt by the Imperium to recover his world. A group of missionaries came to Fedrid to spread the Emperor's word and bring it back to the fold. No sooner had they made planetfall than they were set upon by the locals and almost wiped out. It was Nog's tribe that gave the survivors shelter and listened to their tales of the Imperium. So inspired was the young warrior, he knelt beneath the stars and swore an oath to the Emperor that he would bring Fedrid back to him. For sixty long years, Nog made war on the tribes of Fedrid in the name of the Emperor, finally as an ancient and scarred old man unifying his people. It was not until two hundred years later that the Imperium returned, prepared to once again turn the wayward tribes of the world to the light of the Emperor. What they found was a world more devout than most, which honoured both the Emperor and his saint—Quivvar Nog. When tales of the primitive that had brought faith to the world reached the ears of the Ecclesiarchy, a delegation was sent to investigate. The results were that Nog was recorded as a hero of the Imperium and made a saint.

Shrines to Quivvar can be found dotted throughout the sector, especially on primitive or feral worlds where the inhabitants identify with him. There has been some dispute over the best way to revere Nog. On civilized worlds, marble or granite statues are built to him depicting the saint as a cleanshaven giant dressed in primitive but well-made armour with strong and handsome features. On primitive worlds, clay or wooden idols made in his likeness show him as a squat ugly man with dirty hide armour and a ragged cloak. It is argued that the former is a fantasy concocted by the Ministorum to make him more palatable to more civilized citizens, but one that ultimately betrays the saint's memory. This has lead to the unpleasant practice of befouling statues and shrines that promote this "false" image by those who claim to honour the "true" Nog. In either case, Nog enjoys a broad following as the saint of perseverance and final victory through faith. He is often revered by those with long, thankless tasks ahead of them. Nog is also associated with those too stubborn or too stupid to give up, an aspect many Acolytes can readily relate to.

#### **Elana the Unshaken**

A missionary, Elana made it her lifelong goal to bring the word of the Emperor to the dark places of the Imperium. In her time, she travelled far and wide across the sector, often choosing planets noted for their unruly populations or deadly indigenous life. It is written that she bore a <span id="page-208-0"></span>scar for each world she visited. From the swamps of Ichovor, where she suffered a disfiguring filth-fly bite, to the wilderness of Dusk, where she was savaged by predators, she stoically accepted these "scars" as part of her service the Emperor. More than once, Elana was captured by natives to be maimed or tortured in the name of heathen gods. In all such stories, however, despite the horrors inflicted upon her, she never faltered in her faith. In the end, after travelling to scores of worlds, Elana was captured by a foul Daemon-worshipping cult on a remote, unnamed feral world. The natives tied her up and threw her into their master's cave as an offering. Over the next month the Daemon tired to break her faith. Each day it would come and devour some of her flesh and offer her release. Each day she would refuse. Eventually the Daemon consumed her completely because she would not turn from the light of the Emperor. Elana had a final vengeance, however, as, in eating her flesh and spirit, the Daemon ingested that part of the Emperor that resided within her. The Daemon died screaming as the holy light burned its essence away and freed Elana to her final reward. Clerics like telling this story to prove that faith in the Emperor can overcome anything.

Elana is a much loved and widely accepted saint within the Calixis Sector, and shrines to her can be found on many worlds. This is no doubt because she embodies many of the most desirable qualities in revering the Emperor, namely duty and devotion above personal safety. It might also be because hearing even a little of the saint's suffering can make someone feel infinitely better about their own woes. Those that care for the sick commonly invoke the name of the saint in their work. They preach that Elana watches over all those who suffer in the Emperor's name but who do not lose faith. In some places this line of reason has led to self-flagellation to honour the saint, though the more mainstream elements of the Ecclesiarchy agree that this is probably misguided. Acolytes may find solace in the worship of Elana when they suffer grievous wounds, praying to her to remind them that all that they do, they do for the glory of the Emperor.

*"Behold! A fragment from the cloak of Saint Quivvar, still stained with his holy blood! For such a holy sir as yourself, I would not ask more than the pittance of one hundred Thrones, lest the Emperor Himself smite me where I stand for my greed."* — Final words of Fenex Plorb, Purveyor of Relics and Religious Paraphernalia.

Relics, tokens and charms are much sought after and prized items within the Imperium. In a place where the favour of the Emperor and the blessing of His saints can mean the difference between salvation and damnation, people are eager to secure for themselves the best spiritual protection available. This typically means owning and carrying some kind of charm. These can take many forms, from simple R

corpse hair charms (possibly harvested from a "lucky" relative) to rare and wondrous "true" relics of the saints themselves. The authenticity of such items is of course up to the GM, as for every true relic, countless fakes and copies exist.

#### **Blessed Bolt Casing**

Blessed bolt casings are common relics favoured by warriors and soldiers. Traditionally such casings come from the time of Drusus, used in the conquest of the sector. It is thought that any bolt casing used by a true-hearted warrior of the God-Emperor makes for a powerful charm. Blessed bolt casings are said to ward against the attentions of aliens and other foul creatures from the void. It is even said that presenting such a creature with the casing will strike fear into them and they will be unable look directly upon it. To attest to a casing's holiness they often come with inscriptions engraved into the metal. These usually tell the tale of the casing—who fired it, where and when, and what it killed. The more auspicious the individual who used it and the greater the foe they slew, the greater the shell's blessing. Some rare casings have been used more than once and have a detailed history scribed onto their shells telling of battles, heroes and confirmed kills.

#### **Bones of the First**

When Drusus came to the Calixis Sector, he arrived at the head of an army many millions strong. These men and women fought and died at his side in the saint's battles of conquest and liberation and were blessed for their service. The bones of these "first warriors" can still be found in reliquaries and shrines throughout the sector, often lending their names to towns and provinces where they settled after the conquest. It is said that they still hold the courage which Drusus instilled in them in life, and carrying a bone of one of the "first" is enough to steel a man before battle and calm the fearful with a touch. Whatever the case, bones of the first are among some of the most common relics to be found for sale within the sector. The fact that there were millions of dead makes it hard to disprove their authenticity.

#### **Drusian Tomb Shard**

The grand tomb of Drusus can be found within the Cathedral of Illumination on Scintilla. Of course there are countless lesser tombs scattered across the sector. All are said to hold a portion of the saint's blessing and to touch a tomb to Drusus is considered very favourable. More favourable still is to possess a part of one of these tombs, leading to a thriving trade in Drusian tomb shards. These are small fragments of stone, allegedly chipped-off one of the saint's tombs. The Ministorum outwardly frowns on the practices of defacing tombs, though it makes a small fortune each year in selling them. Where all the shards come from is a mystery and anyone who has seen the grand tomb on Scintilla will attest that it certainly looks "unsullied". Likewise, many other Drusian tombs are constantly guarded to prevent such vandalism. Nevertheless, the market in tomb shards continues to prove very popular with the faithful.

#### **Rags of Nog**

Saint Quivvar Nog is often depicted as wearing a long tattered cloak that swirls heroically around his shoulders. In many illuminations of his deeds, he uses the cloak to soak up the blood of the faithful, as well as, that of his own wounds. Whether or not Nog ever wore a cloak, thousands of fragments of cloth, stained and ancient, can be found in the hands of those that claim they come from the blessed saint himself. These fragments are purported to do miraculous things, ranging from protecting the bearer from wounds and disease, to making them more fertile or granting them superhuman endurance. Many missionaries also carry these pieces of cloth on their travels, believing that whatever powers it possesses, the determination and stubbornness of Nog resides within the rag and can aid them in their holy duty to the God-Emperor.

*"To walk the path of the saints is to look with their eyes and tread with their feet. You will never be as close to the beloved of the Emperor than you are when you don the pilgrim's mantle."* — Esah Gimlas, Sister of the Void.

E very year countless thousands of devout individuals embark on pilgrimages across the sector. Such journeys allow a person to become closer to the God-Emperor and, in theory, gain His eternal blessing. What a pilgrim hopes to gain from such a blessing is often a very personal thing. Some seek the status and honour within the Ecclesiarchy that walking the path of the pilgrim can bring, while others feel they must don the pilgrim's robe to seek absolution. Whatever the reason, those who become pilgrims gain a special status among the citizens of the Imperium: they are allowed to travel along the differing pilgrims paths, travelling to places sanctioned by the Ministorum. They are also permitted passage on many of the Imperium's vessels and many captains consider that having pilgrims on board brings good luck to their voyage. However, there is a price to pay for this special treatment. The Ecclesiarchy view a pilgrim's journey as a sacred thing and those that undertake to follow the path of the saints must first be approved and tested by the Ecclesiarchy. Even then, to abandon a pilgrimage or bring shame to the pilgrim's mantle is a grave offence that is dealt with swiftly and harshly. E

Another important aspect of the many pilgrim trails that criss-cross the sector is the creation of wealth. Where there are pilgrims so too can be found hundreds of industries to support them. These can range from the essential (boarding houses and guides), to the esoteric (spiritual cleansers and sintakers). Many establishments offer special rates for pilgrims, though as pilgrims are almost always new to an area, it is hard to tell if such rates are better or worse than normal. Those that complete a pilgrimage gain the right to wear badges or seals to mark them as an ex-pilgrim. Within the Ministorum, such honours are highly prized and are a symbol of an individual's faith and devotion to the God-Emperor. In fact, to hold office in many cults and parts of the Ministorum, having completed a pilgrimage is a requirement.

While there are scores of pilgrimages that touch almost every world within the sector, only a few are frequently travelled. Two of these more well-known pilgrimages are the Footsteps of Drusus and the Journey of the Hives.

#### **The Footsteps of Drusus**

Though no exact record of Drusus's campaign in the Calixis Sector exist that tell of everywhere he went and all of what he did, there are many worlds that have become sacred to his memory. A path between these worlds, known as the "Footsteps of Drusus", has long been established and a constant stream of pilgrims can be found "walking" it at any one time. It begins in the Golgenna Reach on the planet Scintilla. Each year, prospective pilgrims gather before the gates of the Cathedral of Illumination and members of the Ministorum move among them providing blessing of the saint and giving the pilgrims permission to being their journey. While such permission is mostly symbolic, there have been rare instances where a pilgrim has been denied the right to walk the footsteps of Drusus. This is usually as a result of some past crime that the Ministorum feels would stain the memory of Drusus. From here, the pilgrims march to the spaceport at Hive Tarsus. After ascending into orbit, pilgrims make a circuit of the core worlds of the Golgenna Reach—Sepheris Secundus, the Lathes and Iocanthos. On each of these planets, they travel to the places where Drusus is said to have made his landings and spend days in prayer. From the Golgenna Reach the pilgrimage then spirals out into the Drusus Marches where the journey becomes more dangerous, visiting Endrite and Tygress V. Pilgrims face real peril from both natives and local flora and fauna. The penultimate step sees the pilgrims descend to the dry surface of Maccabeus Quintus to see the shrines built where the man died and the legend of the saint began. Finally, the pilgrimage comes to its end on the world of Sentinel. Many of those who make it to the shrine world do not return. Exhausted by their travels, and without funds, they wander into the wastes to die and at last be at one with their saint.

#### **Journey of the Hives**

The ancient hives of Scintilla are a well-known wonder of the Calixis Sector, shining forth as a beacon of mankind's mastery over his domain. They are also seen as a sacred legacy of both the God-Emperor and his saint Drusus. Each year, pilgrims undertake a pilgrimage on Scintilla known as the "Journey of the Hives". At each of the hives the pilgrims visit a series of shrines and other holy places, spending days in prayer. Traditionally, the pilgrimage should take no more than one planetary cycle to complete. While this may seem an easy task, it is made infinitely harder by the fact that pilgrims must complete their journey on foot.

The trek begins at the base of Hive Sibellus, located on the northern landmass of Scintilla. Pilgrims gather in the last light of the last day of the year where they receive the blessing of the Ecclesiarchy before heading out into the dark. The first leg of their journey takes them to the sulphurous volcanic regions of the continent and the site of Gunmetal City. Entry to the city can be difficult and there are numerous gangs that prey on the pilgrims. For many, the base of the great volcanoes is as far as they get.

After resupplying and resting within Gunmetal City, the pilgrimage continues, this time to wondrous Ambulon. To reach the ever-moving hive, pilgrims must try and discern where it will pass and travel to a location that places themselves in its path. This can take weeks if not longer to complete, and those that are successful may well lose their nerve when they see the massive mechanical hive bearing down upon them. To board the hive, the pilgrims must be pulled up by ropes thrown down from its belly. It is an impressive site to behold as hundreds of men and women grasp at trailing ropes and attempt to hang on while they are drawn up. In fact, hundreds often turn out just to see if any fall to their deaths or are caught in the grinding gears of Ambulon's legs. They are seldom disappointed.

After a brief time in Ambulon, the pilgrims then begin the final leg of their journey. Now they travel south, through the jungles and deserts of the planet's equator. They pass Hive Ten-ebra, though do not enter, and then press on to Hive Tarsus. Here the journey ends at the gates of the Cathedral of Illumination, and those that have made it are given the Emperor's Blessing.

### <span id="page-212-0"></span>Chapter IX: Life as an Acolyte Chapter IX: Life as an Acolyte

*"I was born a gunsmith's scraper and when I was strong enough to carry a lasgun I joined the Guard. I made it all the way to sergeant before he found me. Now I work for the master, and I reckon that's as far as my story goes."*

— Wyree Kobass, Acolyte.

Within the Imperium of Man equality is something that seldom exists beyond one's peers and rare are those that can call themselves truly free, for the greater part of humanity is born into a galactic society of classes, castes and fealty. It is a society that demands loyalty to the Emperor and service to the Imperium. Just as only the tiniest fraction of mankind will ever tread the stars, so too will an equally small minority every rise above their station. Acolytes are among those few exceptions. Of all the agencies of the Throne, the Inquisition is arguably the one with the greatest freedom and the broadest operational mandate. Acolytes can enjoy this freedom as an extension of their service to their Inquisitor, though it comes at a price. Those that become Acolytes forever leave behind their previous lives; accepting that once they join the ranks of the Inquisition, their lives are no longer their own. W

*"A servant is only as powerful as the master he serves."* — Ancient Imperial Proverb.

As members of the Emperor's Holy Inquisition, Acolytes exist outside the bulk of Imperial society. They enjoy the benefits and disadvantages as a result of this. However, the factor that defines their existence more than any other is the person they work for and the favours he can grant them. A skilled and experienced Acolyte will become an indispensable tool in the hands of his Inquisitor. More than this, he will become privy to his master's secrets (probably participating in the creation and covering-up of more than a few of them). This places a bond of trust between Acolyte and Inquisitor, one that a dedicated Acolyte can cultivate and secure. Over time, Acolytes may rise high in their Inquisitor's retinue, becoming part of his personal cadre and travelling with him on the most important of missions. An Acolyte may even impress his master so much that he is granted a title within the Inquisition, perhaps becoming an Interrogator with right to bear the Rosette. After a time, this may even lead to the Acolyte becoming a full Inquisitor in his own right and graduating from his master's shadow to purse his own agenda. A

Most Acolytes, of course, never become more than valued tools and many have little desire to be more than this. While not everyone is fit to be an Inquisitor, anyone can amass

<span id="page-213-0"></span>power and influence, especially in the eyes of their master. Long serving Acolytes are often afforded special privileges and rights by their master as reward for their loyal service. Such boons, however, do not come easily and any gift granted by an Inquisitor is usually earned in blood and toil.

#### **The Secret War** The Secret War

Making a name for yourself and rising through the ranks of the Inquisition is no easy task. The Inquisition is like no other organisation within the Imperium. This is in part to allow it greater freedom to do its work, but also because of the rare and independent kinds of individuals it attracts. Therefore an Acolyte, as an individual in the service of an individual, seeks the favour of a person not an organisation. If an Acolyte wants to rise in the eyes of the Inquisition, he must gain the notice of his Inquisitor. The ambitious servant is rarely alone in this desire for recognition and must compete with scores of his master's other servants (some of whom he may work closely with) for his attention.

Just as Acolytes compete with each other, so too do Inquisitors. This can lead to a far more serious and altogether deadlier kind of competition where more than mere lives are at stake. Inevitably this rivalry affects the Acolytes as they become drawn into their master's conflicts. There is so much infighting within the Inquisition that, at times, much of its resources can become tied up in these internal struggles. Therefore it may become very difficult for an Acolyte to be sure of the foe he is fighting and the righteousness of his cause; he can only trust that the commands of his master are pure in the eyes of the God-Emperor.

#### **Gaining Favour**

Gaining favour within the Inquisition is all about doing the Emperor's work (or at least being seen to do His work). The will of the Emperor is the one thing that no loyal member of the Imperium can refute or disregard. Within the Ordos Calixis there is an intricate system whereby the Inquisitor Lord and his most trusted Inquisitors measure the value of an Imperial servant's contribution to the Imperium. For most Inquisitors, however, this comes down to who they know and the deeds they profess to have achieved. By extension, this is the same yardstick that an Acolyte uses to gain favour with his master. What is his worth? What has he done? And who thinks highly of him?

GMs should encourage their players to think about how their character's actions will influence their standing with their Inquisitor. Beyond merely letting the players know whether they have succeeded or failed in their missions, GMs can drop hints about actions that have especially pleased their master. This is usually something that comes to the Inquisitor's attention—possibly the Acolyte has gone out of his way to further the goals of his master. It could include additional information gathering (taking the chance to poke around when raiding an Imperial database), apprehending criminals and filling bounties (should the Acolyte cross paths with a wanted individual), or anything that shows initiative or dedication to the Inquisition's cause (turning in supposed loyal servants of the Emperor is also looked favourably on).

As with most things, what you can prove is more important that what actually happened. Creative Acolytes can always try and give their actions a positive spin. Even when dealing with an organisation like the Inquisition, which in theory is all about finding truth, some imaginative relating of events can get a character a long way. Apart from getting each player to relate their version of events to the GM (playing their Inquisitor), a method that allows the players to embellish their actions (or downplay their mistakes) is to ask them to write a report of the mission. It doesn't need to be long, just enough to touch on the main points of the mission and how it concluded. This allows the players to really think about what they are going to tell their Inquisitor and also gives the GM a record of each of the Acolytes' missions. GMs can also keep the reports as evidence for later should any of the Acolytes' actions ever be called into question.

#### **First Among Equals**

Like any group, a band of Acolytes usually has a leader and in most Inquisitorial retinues this individual is known as the "Prime". Most Inquisitors have a vast network of operatives branching out from them, becoming more and more scattered the further they get from their master. To organise and control each of these branches, and the cells of operatives they support, Primes are put in place, acting as links and junction points leading back to the master. The Prime acts as both a link to the Inquisitor (sometimes though other Primes), as well as a method of surreptitiously reporting on the others in their group.

A good Prime is rewarded with more power, sometimes getting to see a little more of the vast latticework that is his master's organisation and perhaps even being entrusted with another group of Acolytes somewhere further down the chain. Most Inquisitors, though, move their Primes about or pass the mantle of Prime around within a cadre of Acolytes. This is partly to get a better picture of those that work for him and partly so that no one individual in his organisation can gather too much power without his knowledge. As a result, bearing the mark of the Prime can be a mixed blessing, and sometimes a group of especially close Acolytes will share the responsibility, creating their own internal hierarchy despite the wishes of their master. Far from angering most Inquisitors, they appreciate such independence in their servants.

#### **First Among Inquisitors**

The pecking order that exists between Inquisitors is far less formalised than the idea of Primes. Each a powerful, independent individual in their own right, they naturally do not like being told what to do by others. It is worth remembering that most Inquisitor's were once Acolytes and they take with them much of their former master's reputation when they enter the office. This can lead to complicated and convoluted lines of fealty within the Inquisition, much as exists among an individual Inquisitor's Acolytes, with lines of masters and servants stretching back across the centuries. Quite often, as a result of rejuvenate treatments, an Inquisitor may still be in contact with their former master and possibly their master's master, or even their master's master's master, and so on…

#### **Wielding the Rosette**

The greatest gift an Inquisitor can grant an Acolyte is the right to wield the Inquisitorial Rosette in his name. For much of an Acolyte's work he will never identify himself as a member of the Inquisition and even when he does, it is usually at the behest of his master. Much rarer are the times when the Acolyte uses the raw power of the Inquisition to get the job done, for example commandeering vessels or pressing soldiers into service.

A Rosette is more than a mere medallion of precious metals bearing the mark of the Inquisition (the Inquisitorial "I"), notated in the Calixis Sector by the mark of the Ordo Calixis (the Chalice). Each one is a sophisticated means of identification specifically keyed to an individual Inquisitor. "Fooling" a Rosette is no easy feat as a complex system of biorecognition and DNA scanning technology ensures that it only functions in the hands of its rightful owner, or those who are deemed worthy of its use. For an Acolyte to be granted a copy of their master's Rosette (and the sanctioning to use it), shows great trust on the part of the Inquisitor and as such, it is a rare occurrence. Only when an Acolyte ascends to the station of Interrogator is he usually granted this honour.

Other tokens of authority, such as a Legate Investigator's Sigil of Question or a Excoriator's gilded bolt shell, are sometimes granted by the Acolyte's Inquisitor, though usually only for the execution of specific tasks. Such items are more commonly given, while the Rosette is reserved for those who have earnt the faith of their Inquisitor. After all, when an Acolyte uses the Rosette his actions are not his alone, ultimately it is their Inquisitor who must answer for abuses of power. In such cases, the Inquisitor may well survive the outcome, unlike the unfortunate Acolyte.

The status of an Inquisitor is a result of his accomplishments and the perception of his peers. Those that have laid great piles of heads at the Emperor's feet (either figuratively or literally) earn for themselves great rights within the Ordos Calixis. Likewise, those that earn a reputation, either good or bad, also win high acclaim. Quite often an Acolyte might find himself in the line of fire (sometime literally) because of his Inquisitor's relationship with his peers. Warbands of rival Inquisitors especially can come to blows over a myriad of things, most often a difference of opinion on how best to serve the Emperor's will. Such is the nature of an Inquisitor's work that these kinds of struggles are accepted and sometimes even condoned by higher powers. It is said that Lord Inquisitor Caidin likes a degree of rivalry between his subjects, all the better to ensure that they are working at their best. All an Acolyte needs to know, however, is that when he swears to serve an Inquisitor, he accepts the enemies and rivals of his master without question.

Beyond merely risking life and limb in such conflicts, Acolytes can also sometimes find themselves sought out for service by rival Inquisitors. In the Calixis Sector at any one time there are scores of Inquisitors at work and below them, hundreds of Acolytes. As a result, it is not uncommon for these Inquisitorial servants to brush shoulders in their tasks, especially if they happen to be investigating the same thing. This gives some Inquisitors the chance to win over new recruits and, in such circumstances, Acolytes are sometimes deployed with the specific task of "headhunting". An Acolyte that does trade masters, however, is in for a rocky road; even if they should prove themselves competent and loyal to their new master, they will always be tarnished by their betrayal.

This can, in turn, lead to Acolytes working for more than one Inquisitor; a not altogether uncommon occurrence. This is a dangerous path to tread and should either of the Inquisitors become aware of the Acolyte serving two masters, the best he can hope for is a short-lived career as a double agent or informer. When an Acolyte loses the trust of his Inquisitor, he does not remain an Acolyte long; in fact, he is fortunate if he remains as anything.

### <span id="page-215-0"></span>The Web of Shadows The We b of Shadows

*"Most Inquisitors never truly know how many people work for them. Indeed, many of those that do never know that they work for an Inquisitor."*

— Vi Dorapps, Master of Names.

By its nature the Inquisition is an organisation that sprawls across sectors, worlds and social strata. At any one time, an individual Inquisitor may have agents scattered across a sector. Just as all the resources of the Imperium are at an Inquisitor's disposal, so too are its citizens. This is a resource that Inquisitors make good use of. After all, this is where they find their Acolytes. As they rise in their master's organisation, Acolytes find themselves more and more relying on their own initiative and ability to use the people at hand to get the job the done—normally this means manipulating and recruiting the people around them. To effectively make use of this massive resource, Acolytes must master two of the oldest and most useful tactics employed by their masters—secret identities and maintaining a "healthy" network of contacts. B

Acolytes will not often use their own identities, especially when performing investigations. While anyone can of course come up with a false name on the fly, clever Acolytes usually have a set of prepared identities ready to use. Likewise, cultivating a good contact can make an Acolyte's life infinitely easier. It is much better to have someone on the inside during an investigation than having to trawl the local drinking holes in the hope of finding some clues.

Presented here you will find a set of guidelines for creating alter egos and developing contacts for your Acolyte. These rules can be used to enhance the capabilities of your character, allowing him to better access secret information, travel unnoticed or obtain rare equipment. Power-hungry Acolytes can also make good use of these tactics in order to build their own empires of informers and spies, perhaps preparing for the time when they themselves might be

granted the Rosette. In addition to these obvious game advantages, both secret identities and contacts can be used as roleplaying tools, adding depth and substance to your PC. An Acolyte's contacts should be much more that a set of bonuses to dice rolls, rather they should develop into fully fledged NPCs during the course of play, perhaps even building emotional and personal ties to the PC.

*"Greetings, my name is Lord Greor, First Master of the Ralkir Fleet, High Councilman of the House Vigilant and Commander of the Dark Reproach… no, the other Lord Greor."*

— Lord Greor.

Acolytes are deliberately chosen by their Inquisitors rather than assigned. An Acolyte could be anyone from anywhere within the Imperium. Often an Acolyte is chosen for his anonymity within Imperial society, allowing him to move freely from one place to another and go where more obvious authorities would arouse too much suspicion. To this end, Acolytes, during the course of their careers, find themselves often posing as a variety of people and professions in their efforts to root out heresy and track down traitors. This is where secret identities come in extremely handy. A

#### **What is an Alter Ego?** What is an Alter Ego?

An alter ego is simply another name and persona you employ to conceal your true intentions and to protect yourself from your enemies. You can have several alternate identities, some almost as detailed as your real identity, some merely a different name and set of credentials. Such false personas are a staple of most Acolyte's work, especially when conducting investigations, but also when dealing with contacts and even other members of the Inquisition. In essence, an alter ego becomes another character for you to play, a set of mannerisms and quirks used by your PC to change their personality.

#### **Plot Hooks**

One of the key benefits of creating and using both secret identities and contacts is that they make excellent plot hooks for the GM. Contacts make excellent NPCs, since the Acolyte already knows them and presumably has a vested interest in keeping them alive. Thus if an adventure calls for the Acolytes to rush to the aid of someone or search for a missing person, one of the Acolyte's contacts makes an obvious choice. By that same token, contacts can be used to get information to the PCs that they would otherwise have no way of knowing. This can be very useful in an adventure if, for some reason, the Acolytes miss a vital clue or set off in the wrong direction. However, this "trick" should be used sparingly as having the PCs contacts coming to their "rescue" can be unsatisfying for most groups and may stretch the players' belief in the game-story too far.

Secret identities can also provide plenty of fun for GMs. The classic example of this is that they can be used to create cases of mistaken identity. Perhaps an Acolyte's false persona bears an uncanny resemblance to someone else and he suddenly finds himself hunted for crimes he did not commit. Worse still, an Acolyte may find that his enemies have learned of one or more of his secret identities and are secretly manipulating him, leading to the unsettling situation where the player discovers that his "other" self has been doing things and travelling to places without his knowledge! A particularly bizarre (but nevertheless intriguing) use of this device is to have the Acolytes effectively investigating himself. Someone might use his identity to commit a crime; though only through gathering clues does the Acolyte discover that the person he is looking for is in fact someone he has "created".

#### **Creating Alter Egos** Creating Alter Egos

The first step in constructing an alter ego is to decide how he or she differs from your character. Obviously, your new persona will have things in common with the old, such as (usually) basic appearance and gender. However, there should be some fundamental differences. In addition, you need to decide what purpose your alter ego serves, as they can be used for a myriad of things from simple misdirection to deep infiltration. When creating an alter ego you should try and address each of the following questions:

#### <span id="page-216-0"></span>**Why do you need an Alter Ego?**

For what purpose does your Acolyte require a false identity? Is it simply something to hide the fact you work for the Inquisition? If this is the case, it is probably not too far removed from your own profession (i.e. a Guardsman claiming to be a mercenary). Alternatively, you might want to create an identity for a specific task, such as infiltrating a cult or gaining access to restricted Imperial authorities such as the Adeptus Arbites or the Ministorum. Some identities might even be more specific than that, designed for a particular mission, such as framing or "befriending" someone.

#### **Who is your Alter Ego?**

You'll need a name for your alter ego. A name carries a lot of weight; it evokes expectations, beliefs and goes a long way towards making your new identity believable. For instance, if you wanted to create a noble identity you might choose a particularly regal sounding name, like Augustus Voght. You might then add some kind of title or honorific, like Patriarch or Hierarch. Of course, at its most basic, any name that sounds like it would fit the person you are trying to become should do.

#### **How does the Alter Ego differ from you?**

With the name in place, you should decide on what ways the alter ego differs from your PCs true identity. Does your alter ego walk with a limp, wear a green wig or end every sentence with "…by the grace of the Emperor"? Such minor details add "character" to this new identity, whilst also providing you with a few props when taking on the role of this character.

#### **Can the Alter Ego be widely used?**

Is this an identity that can only be used once or numerous times? Often, the more detailed the persona, the more restricted it becomes. For instance, if you were posing as a member of the Plumes in the city of Olrankan on the world of Acreage, that identity is not likely to be of much use anywhere else (though it would be very useful in Olrankan). However, if you were to pose as a missionary or pilgrim, you could doubtless use your alter ego anywhere in the sector, but it would naturally not afford you much access to local authorities. For this reason, Acolytes often have several sets of identities, some broad and some specific.

#### **How detailed is the Alter Ego?**

Is it just a name? Do you have identity papers, records and other false methods of proving who you are? Creating a new name and history should be quite easy. After all, this is in essence a set of prepared lies that the Acolyte has on hand to fool others and, unless they are really looking, these are all you need. If someone digs deeper and runs any kind of security check, the identity is going to need proof to back itself up. Usually this is some kind of local ID endorsed by whatever passes for the planetary government, though on more advanced or sophisticated worlds, it can include detailed bio-scans or gene-printing which can be considerably harder to fool.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### <span id="page-217-0"></span>**Does the Alter Ego have any special powers?**

This is an important part of an alter ego and one most likely to test its strength. If an identity is just used for hiding, it probably doesn't need to do anything special: for example, "Dufra the hab worker" is good to use when you don't want to be noticed, but she certainly doesn't have any kind of special clearance or authority. Pretending to be a PDF lieutenant or even a planetary governor can put all sorts of options at your fingertips, though they are markedly harder to get away with. Any kind of special abilities related to an alter ego should be discussed with the GM.

#### **Do you need to do anything to maintain the Alter Ego?**

Do you need to keep in contact with anyone, log reports or make appearances to keep your alter ego alive? This is important for identities with any kind of authority, special access or those who are very "visible". You might find that your secret identities come with responsibilities and obligations that must be honoured in order to keep them from getting into trouble.

#### **How often do you use the identity?**

How often you use an identity often directly relates to how real it is. In some cases, you might use an alternative persona more than your real one. In fact, it is even possible that your fellow Acolytes don't know for sure who you really are

#### **Example**

*John wants to create an alter ego for his character Morden in order to be able to travel to the world of Sentinel unnoticed. As a shrine world, Sentinel sits on one of the many pilgrim trails that criss-cross the sector. John therefore decides that Morden's alternative identity is a pilgrim. Firstly, he comes up with a name, Horpus Feldor. He then creates a sad story about how Horpus lost his family to the Simpering Rot on Scintilla and how he donned the pilgrim's mantle to find peace. Finally, John spends some Thrones on various pilgrim medallions and badges to complete the disguise. Thus Horpus the Pilgrim is born.*

#### **Buying Alter Egos** Buying Alter Egos

While an alternative identity is more about roleplaying rather than hard rules, if it affords your PC significant powers above and beyond what they could normally employ, the GM may require an xp cost to pay for it. This should be rare, and only if the identity is one you can use in almost every game session. For example, if the Acolyte was believed to be a high level Administratum Overseer and he used his connections in every game to gain information he would not normally have access to, this is a strong advantage that should require the player to spend xp upon. Of course, if he was merely a bounty hunter with the right to claim money for bringing in the occasional criminal, this is not really a great benefit to the player beyond being a way to hide his character's true persona.

When determining the cost of such connection and abilities, the GM can use the cost for contacts as a guide (see [page 220\).](#page-220-0)

More often, the cost of having an alter ego is only monetary, for such things as false IDs, records, disguises and bribes. In such cases, the player may decide how little or how much money they wish to spend in creating the identity. The GM should consider the Difficulty of obtaining these things when working out the price, taking into account the Skills and Talents that the Acolyte might be able to use to obtain them (such as underworld contacts, scribing skills for forgery and so on).

#### **Using an Alter Ego**

Whenever you are to deal with someone, you must decide what identity you will use. This is especially true when you travel from one place to another or first enter a new locale such as an organisation or a hive. The GM should decide how curious people are about you and how good your alter ego really is.

An Acolyte talking to people in a bar could give a false name and be fairly confident that most of the patrons would not think to question him (mostly because they wouldn't care). Even if someone was looking for him, unless they have a detailed description, a false name would be enough. However, if the Acolyte wanted to make contact with a local gang in the same bar, he might be subjected to far greater scrutiny.

If at any time the GM decides that the alter ego is coming under scrutiny, he may require the player to make a Charm, Blather, Deceive or Disguise Test. The GM should determine if any bonuses apply, depending on how detailed the player has made their identity, or what penalties must be taken into consideration for how suspicious the questioner is. Typically though, even someone on their guard will accept an identity if it seems genuine enough and if it can be "backed-up".

Should the identity be tested in other ways, such as checking official ID, seeing if they exist on records or taking genetic scans, it comes down to how many of these bases the Acolyte has covered. Clever Acolytes have at least one form of officially endorsed ID and one credible person somewhere to vouch for them, as this is usually enough to convince most authorities. Again, the GM will determine what, if any, bonuses or penalties should be applied to Tests. Typically, the more a player has spent (in terms of xp and/or money) will provide a greater Test bonus, in addition to how well the player has "maintained" the persona (where the alter ego is a long-standing or well-known personality).

# Contacts Contacts

<span id="page-218-0"></span>*"I know a guy who talked to this enforcer that arrested this girl who had a drink with this other guy who swears he saw Drusus's ghost down on hab level three two nights ago."*

— Ungel Slib, Information Broker.

Amidst the undulating sea of humanity, Acolytes find a myriad of citizens they can utilize for their own ends. Whether it is because of their position, influence or special talents, these people can provide an Acolyte with things they could not otherwise obtain, possibly even with the weight of the Inquisition at their back. Over time, an Acolyte may even create a web of such people, hailing from diverse worlds and backgrounds, to act as allies and informants throughout the sector. However, finding a range of good contacts can be a full time task, as is keeping them. A

#### **What is a Contact?** What is a Contact?

A contact is anyone the Acolyte knows that is willing to provide information, equipment or favours. This might be out of the goodness of their own heart, because they feel obligated to the Acolyte or perhaps it is for money or favours in return. Contacts might be individuals, groups or even entire Adeptus. Acolytes may even cultivate members of the Inquisition as contacts, which could be other Acolytes (though not PCs) or other Inquisitors. Fundamentally, to be considered a contact, the NPC must have some kind of relationship with the Acolyte and must be able to provide him with something useful in game play.

#### **Creating a Contact** Creating a Contact

During the course of their career an Acolyte comes into contact with countless people, not all of them intent of killing him. Some of these may be ripe for cultivation as contacts. There are two main ways in which a Player Character might gain a contact: either when they first create their character or during play by meeting likely NPCs. In both cases, it is up to the GM to approve a contact for the game, though in the latter case the player can choose whether or not to turn an NPC into a contact. When a contact is created, whether it is by the GM or by the player, you can use the following questions to help you determine who they are and what they can offer the Acolyte.

#### **Who is the Contact?**

More than their name, you need to decide whether the contact is an individual, a group or something larger. For instance, having the ear of Sabius Gout the local Enforcer Captain is different from being able to receive favours from all enforcers in Hive Secondus on Malfi.

#### **How powerful is the Contact?**

This is probably the most important aspect of your contact. Most contacts will only be able to provide limited information or help specific to their area of expertise and almost never beyond the bounds of their world. For instance, a colonel in the Barsapine PDF, while quite powerful within the ranks of the general military, would have limited influence with other organisations on Barsapine and none beyond its borders.

#### **What can the Contact give you?**

The easiest commodity, and often the most useful, is information. However, a contact might also be able to get cheap or difficult to find equipment. Some might even be able to provide items not normally available within the Imperium. Contacts could also provide favours, ranging from something as simple as putting in a good word with their bosses up to "lending" out an Imperial Guard infantry battalion.

#### **What is your relationship to the Contact?**

Your relationship with your contact is the result of many factors, such as how you came to find and "recruit" them, their social background in contrast to yours and how you intend to use them in the future. In most cases, the Acolyte exploits the contact's obligation to the Emperor or their greed. Sometimes an Acolyte may form a bond with a contact and they come to be close friends. Equally, some contacts may actually hate the Acolyte and only "serves" them out of fear or for the chance to one day get even for some past slight or harm.

Some contacts might adore you while others hate your guts. How the contact regards you aids the GM in portraying your contact appropriately, as well as shaping the contact's general actions. It is worth mentioning, that whether or not a contact likes you does not have to affect their trustworthiness or reliability. Someone who hates you might still take pride in their work and do a good job, while someone who loves you might do something misguided.

#### **How trustworthy is the Contact?**

Stemming from the Acolyte's relationship with the contact is their trustworthiness. While ultimately it is up to the GM to decide just how loyal a contact is, a PC may already have a fair idea, especially if they continually treat the contact badly. While many players might reject the idea of using a contact they cannot fully trust, sometimes the benefits they offer make it worth the risk.

#### **How did you meet the Contact?**

This is an important question for helping the GM to decide where the contact "fits" into the game. Most contacts don't travel about (though they may be contactable from a great distance) and in all probability live somewhere within the Calixis Sector. Where they live and how you came to meet them will give you an idea of the role they might play in the future.

#### **Do any of your fellow Acolytes know about the Contact?**

Contacts are often personal things and while an Acolyte might share the information he gains grouping order for the group to meet its objectives, it is unlikely he will let others make use of his "special" sources. Clever Acolytes keep their contacts to themselves, but you need to decide whether others in your group may be aware of your connections.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Example**

*John wants to create a contact for his PC—Morden—that can get him high-spec weapons. Working with the GM, he decides that Morden's contact is an arms merchant from Gunmetal City, named Kout. Kout owns his own shop but beyond that has little power or influence. He can offer information (only pertinent to Gunmetal City), but is mostly useful for procuring arms. They met when Morden was investigating arms smuggling between the hives of Scintilla and he used the information he gained to "convince" Kout to work for him. Kout does not like him very much but Morden doesn't care as long as he gets what he needs.*

#### **Contact Reliability**

Some contacts are more reliable than others and some are downright dangerous to associate with. The quality of a contact determines such things as how frequently you can use them and just how good the services they provide are. There are three grades of contact: Trusted, Common and Dubious.

#### **Trusted**

Some rare contacts actually like the Acolyte and may even have become fast friends with them. These are people who assist out of duty and honour and go to great lengths to provide help. A Trusted contact in the right place at right time can be worth more that a squad of storm troopers.

A Trusted contact can be used as many times as the Acolyte likes, provided he has some way of getting in touch with them. If the Acolyte is actually operating in the contact's immediate locale, it is even more likely that he will be able to provide good information or access to equipment, as well as being freer with favours.

#### **Common**

Most contacts fall into this category. These are contacts who, on the whole, are reliable and able to offer good information or equipment, though, they don't usually go out of their way for the Acolyte.

A Common contact can be used once per game session provided the Acolyte has some way of getting in touch with him. If the GM decides that he should play a larger role in the adventure (i.e. the Acolyte's mission is taking place in the contact's immediate locale), you might be able to use the contact more than once.

#### **Dubious**

Some contacts are of questionable value or who are mostly unreliable. These are contacts that either don't like the Acolyte and who resent being used or are simply fickle by nature. They can sometimes offer good quality information and access to equipment, but there is a greater chance that they will be unhelpful.

A Dubious contact can be used once per game session provided the Acolyte has some way of getting in touch with them. Unlike Common contacts, there is a greater chance they provide false or misleading information.

### **Example**

*John and the GM decide that Kout, even though he doesn't like John's character, is a solid individual that knows his trade well. This makes him a Common contact—far from the Acolyte's best friend, but reliable nevertheless.*

#### <span id="page-220-0"></span>**Buying Contacts** Buying Contacts

Whether gained through play or during character creation, GMs may require players to pay a cost in xp for their contacts, especially if they are particularly useful and give them an advantage. Once you have decided who your contact is and what he can do for you, use Table 9-1: Pricing Contacts to work out how many of these benefits apply and add up the cost in Experience Points. Some aspects of a contact will reduce their overall cost, but no reduction in price can make a contact worth less than 0 xp.

| Table 9-1: Pricing Contacts               |                |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------|

| *PC must have related Peer talent.        |                |

#### **Contact is an Individual**

**Cost:** 10

The contact is a single named individual, such as an Arbitraitor or Administratum clerk. He might be powerful within his position, however he remains a single person and the Acolyte can only deal with him. Individuals are the most common kind of contact, though also the most vulnerable.

#### **Contact is a Group Cost:** 50

The contact is a group of some kind, usually limited to a specific place or world. This could be an underhive gang or a cult. Like an individual, a group is usually limited to influencing a single area of expertise or locale. However, they enjoy several benefits over individuals. These include added resources and the advantage of being less vulnerable to the Acolyte's foes.

#### **Contact is an Adeptus**

#### **Cost:** 200

**Special:** You must have a related Peer talent.

The contact is an arm of the Imperium. This could include such star-spanning organisations as the Ministorum or the Adeptus Arbites. Unlike other kinds of contacts, adeptus have vast resources and power covering many worlds. While having an adeptus as a contact does not automatically guarantee that every member of the organisation will be disposed to helping the Acolyte, it gives him much greater access than he would normally enjoy. Adeptus are also the most resilient kind of contacts as they are practically impossible to destroy.

#### **Contact has Military Connections Cost:** 50

The contact has access to military forces or equipment. This could be because he is part of the Imperial Guard, local PDF or some other kind of paramilitary organisation. Contacts with military ties have greater access to weapons and equipment as well as classified information. In addition, the contact can sometimes offer direct military assistance in the form of Guardsmen, fighting vehicles or even warships.

#### **Contact has Special Powers**

**Cost:** 200

The contact has some kind of special power, such as the unquestionable authority of an Inquisitor or the mental powers of a psyker. The contact can perform special feats that would normally be beyond the ability of the Acolyte. Such contacts are rare and difficult to find.

#### **Contact has a Skill**

#### **Cost:** 10 per Skill

The contact has a useful Skill. Usually this will be Inquiry when trying to gather information but it can also include such things as a Common, Scholastic or Forbidden Lore. At the GMs discretion, it may also include more unusual Skills. Note that the Acolyte does not need to possess the Skill for the contact to make use of it.

#### **Contact is an expert in a Skill**

**Cost:** 20 per Skill

The contact has expertise in one or more Skill (Skill Mastery). Experts gain a +20 Test bonus when using the Skill.

#### **Contact has a Skill Group**

#### **Cost:** 50 per Skill Group

The contact has a complete Group of Skills, usually all Common, Scholastic or Forbidden Lore skills. With the GMs approval, your contact could have a more unusual range of abilities. However, these must either be all from the same Skill Group or be closely related. Note that the Acolyte does not need to possess any of these Skills for the contact to make use of them.

#### **Contact is an expert in a Skill Group Cost:** 50 per Group

The contact has expertise in a Skill Group (Skill Mastery). Experts gain a +20 Test bonus when using any of the Skills in their Skill Group.

#### **I used to know someone…**

At the discretion of the GM, an Acolyte's Career Path may also play a role in how they make contacts. Obviously it is going to be easier and make more sense for an ex-Imperial Guardsman to know someone still serving in the army, just as an Arbitraitor is going to have more reason to still deal with the Adeptus Arbites. In these cases, if the player can come up with a plausible story as to why he as a contact that relates directly to his background, you can reduce the contact's cost. Typically this kind of background contact should cost 50% of the normal price. The advantage of giving this kind of discount is that it creates a more logical and believable spread of contacts throughout the group and each character will have his own fields of speciality. After all, if you want to contact a hive gang who better to ask than the Scum character. GMs should be careful, however, of players who come up with far-fetched stories to allow them cheaper access to particular kinds of contacts that do not really fit into their background.

#### **Contact is able to reduce an item's Availability**

#### **Cost:** 10 per level

The contact can reduce the Availability of a particular kind of equipment (such as tools or drugs), ranged weapons, melee weapons or armour. This advantage can be purchased in up to three levels.

Example: If your PC was trying to acquire a Rare item, a contact with one level of this advantage would reduce it to Scarce, two levels would reduce it to Average and three levels would reduce it to Common.

#### **Contact can reduce an item's price**

**Cost:** 20 per 10%

The contact can reduce the cost of a particular kind of equipment (such as tools or drugs), ranged weapons, melee weapons or armour. This advantage can be bought in up to three levels.

#### **Example**

*If your PC was trying to purchase a long las (cost 100), a contact with one level of this advantage would reduce the cost to 90, two levels would reduce it to 80 and three levels would reduce it to 70.*

#### **Contact is able to reduce all Availability Cost:** 50 per degree

The contact can reduce the Availability of any equipment. This advantage can be bought in up to three levels and otherwise works as above.

#### **Contact is able to reduce all prices**

#### **Cost:** 100 per 10%

The contact can reduce the cost of any equipment. This advantage can be bought in up to three levels and otherwise works as above.

#### **Contact offers Favours Cost:** 150

The contact can offer favours. A favour does not need to be specified when the contact is created. However, each time you ask your contact for a favour, he is less likely to grant it. Favours are always something that is reasonably within the power of the contact to grant and the GM has the final say on what favours are offered. Favours are covered in more detail on [page 223.](#page-223-0)

#### **Contact is Trusted**

#### **Cost:** 100

The contact is Trusted. He can be used as often as the player likes and are very reliable. Favours from Trusted contacts are also easier to obtain and are more impressive than those from other kinds of contacts.

#### **Contact is Common**

**Cost:** 0

The contact is Common. He can be used at least once a game session and is reasonably reliable.

#### **Contact is Dubious**

#### **Cost:** –50

The contact is Dubious. He can be used only once a game session and there is a greater chance that he provides false (or just plain wrong) information or flawed equipment. Favours from Dubious contacts are few and far between and usually not to be trusted should they manifest.

#### **Contact is Dangerous**

#### **Cost:** –100

The contact is dangerous to use. Every time the contact is used for information, equipment or favours there is a chance it could all go horribly wrong.

#### **Example**

*John decides that Kout can offer both a little information and access to weapons. Though Kout owns his own shop and has a network of contacts himself, he is still an individual (+10). He finds out information for the Acolyte, thus he has the Inquiry skill (+10). He can make ranged weapons two degrees easier to find (+20) and reduce the cost of ranged weapons by 20% (+40); Kout is also a Common Contact (+0). John decides that Kout does not like his character enough to offer any favours. Thus Kout costs John's character a total of 80 xp.*

#### <span id="page-222-0"></span>**Using Your Contacts** Using Your Contacts

You may employ your contacts at any time by simply declaring their use to the GM. You may use your contact only a limited number of times each game session, depending on the contact's Reliability . The GM then decides how difficult this will be, depending on such factors as how far away the contact is (perhaps the other side of the sector) and your current access to communication. If it is reasonable for you to make contact (GMs should not be too harsh in restricting Acolyte's access to their contacts), you may ask your contact for information, equipment or a favour. If the GM wants, the interaction between Acolyte and contact can be roleplayed, with the player trying to ask the right questions of his contact or even trying to convince him to help. However, this should be in the interests of fun and shouldn't penalise players who are not as skilful negotiators as are their characters.

#### **Getting Information**

There are a number of ways the GM can handle requests for information. If the information is something the contact would know and is well within their ability to impart, the GM might simply pass it on to the player. For instance, a citizen would be able to tell the Acolyte all the local news pertaining to their home. If the information is harder to obtain, or secret in any way, the GM should Test the contact's Inquiry skill. Likewise, if the Acolyte is asking any kind of question that falls into the contact's area of expertise, such as Common, Scholastic and Forbidden Lore skills, the GM should also take a Test. These Tests are made from a base score of 40. This reflects the contact's training with the Skill as well as his connections and resources. The GM may add modifiers to this roll just like a normal Test to reflect the Difficulty or ease of the task requested.

It is also possible that a contact may provide misinformation, either intentionally or by mistake. If, after modifiers, the Test to acquire information fails by more than three degrees, the contact provides the Acolyte with a piece of false information. This can be anything the GM wants, from the merely misleading (providing confusing or nonsensical information) to the downright dangerous (sending the Acolyte into peril). Dubious contacts are more unreliable than most and any failed Skill Test from such a contact always provides false information.

Ultimately, it is important to remember that the GM always has the final say when deciding what information a contact can provide. After all, it would be somewhat of an anticlimax to solve a complex investigation just because Rynns from Hab Maintenance happened to pick up the head cultist's wallet.

#### **Equipment**

Getting equipment is much the same as finding information. The Acolyte requests a piece of equipment from his contact and then the contact makes an Inquiry Test (even if he does not have the Skill for the purposes of providing information) at 40. Use the rules for Availability from Dark Heresy (see page 125), remembering to adjust the item's Rarity depending on the ability of the contact. If successful, the contact finds the item and can provide it for the Acolyte at its cost, remembering as well to apply any discount afforded by the contact's ability.

It is possible for contacts to provide faulty equipment in the same way as false information. If a contact fails his Inquiry Test to find a piece of equipment by more than three degrees, the item the Acolyte is looking has something wrong with it. Typically this means that, if a weapon, it has a much greater chance of jamming (any miss will result in a Jam), or its Range or its clip capacity is reduced, if a drug, it inflicts 1d10 points of Damage when used, or if a scanner, it provides a false reading, and so on. An honest contact might tell the Acolyte about the item's faults and see if he still wants it at a reduced cost. Most contacts, however, sell it anyway and plead ignorance if the Acolyte demands a refund. Dubious contacts are more unreliable than most and any failed Inquiry Test by one or more degrees always provides faulty equipment.

At the GMs discretion, a contact capable of providing equipment may also be able to provide other items not normally available to the Acolyte (i.e. not listed in the Armoury). In these cases, the GM must assign a price and Availability to the item, usually Rare or Very Rare with a high cost. A contact's ability to make items easer to find or cheaper never applies when trying to procure such items. In addition, trying to get such items, especially if they are of xenos origin, can be very risky. Whenever a contact is used in this way it counts as being a Dangerous Contact.

In both cases, the GM makes all Tests secretly, thus the player cannot be sure of the quality of their information or item, or, perhaps, exactly why their contact is not being forthcoming.

#### **Example**

*John's character, Morden, travels to Gunmetal City. He wants to find out some information before he gets there. John tells the GM that Morden is contacting Kout to ask him about a particular gang, the Lock Blades, who operate in the city. Information on the Locks is not common knowledge, so Kout has to make an Inquiry Test. His base Skill is 40, but the GM decides that because of the merchant's ties to the underworld, and the fact that he sells guns regularly to gangs, the Test is Routine (+20). The GM secretly makes the roll and gets 97. Since he has failed by more than three degrees he provides John's character with some misleading information on the gang. Kout gives Morden a false location for the Lock Blades headquarters, which may well get him into trouble when he arrives…*

#### **Using Contacts in Downtime**

Contacts can also be used in downtime between adventures, and in the case of contacts that provide equipment, this is probably the most useful time to make use of them. So long as the Acolyte can reasonably get in touch with his contact (i.e. he is not trapped on some isolated world far from Imperial space), he should be allowed to make full use of the contact to get weapons, amour and other gear. The amount of equipment and how long it takes to arrive is up to the GM. As a rule of thumb, a player should not be able to procure more than two or three weapons or pieces of gear. The time it takes for the equipment to arrive is directly proportional to the distance currently between the Acolyte and his contact, which can sometime equate to weeks or months of ship transit time.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### <span id="page-223-0"></span>**Example**

*John's character wants a boltgun. Since it is between game sessions, John asks the GM if he can use his contact, Kout, to make it easier. Normally, a boltgun costs 500 Thrones and has an Availability of Very Rare. Because Morden is using Kout, the cost drops to 400 Thrones (–20%) and becomes Scarce (dropping two levels of Rarity). In addition, John can use Kout's Inquiry skill of 40 and the population of Gunmetal City (several million) to influence the roll. Normally the Difficulty of the Test to find a Scarce item would be Difficult (–10). However, the population of the city increase this to Routine (+20). These factors combined means that the GM Tests against 60 to see if Kout has a boltgun in stock.*

#### **Favours**

Favours are another commodity that contacts can sometimes peddle, though these are much rarer and harder to obtain. A favour can include anything within the contact's power to grant. This could include security clearances, the use of expensive or rare equipment and even personnel.

With a favour, the Acolyte can ask anything and it is up to the GM to decide whether or not the contact will (or even can) grant it. GMs should take into account such things as the relationship the contact has with the Acolyte and just how much trouble the contact might get into if he grants the favour. For some, especially small favours (such as providing transport across a hive or a bed for the night), the GM may not require a Test. This might also be the case if the contact wants to grant the favour. Mostly, however, the Acolyte just needs to convince the contact. To do this, the player must Test against Intelligence or Fellowship (though they can use appropriate Interaction Skills at the GMs discretion) adding +5 for every Rank he has. This Test can be modified as normal. If he passes, the contact provides the favour.

The first time the Acolyte asks his contact for a favour, he may make his Test at no penalty. However, for each successive time, the Acolyte takes a cumulative –10 penalty to the Test. For favours that do not require rolls, the GM might decide that after a certain number of times a Test will be required, applying penalties as normal from that point forward. Trusted contacts do not incur penalties on any rolls to grant favours, no matter how often they are asked. Finally, over a reasonable length of time (such as a mission that takes several gaming sessions), the GM should reset this penalty, reflecting the fact that the contact has not been asked for anything for a while and is more disposed to helping the Acolyte.

#### **Dangerous Contacts**

Some contacts are just hazardous to an Acolyte's health. A dangerous contact is one that could cause the Acolyte undue trouble whenever he is used. This could be for obvious reasons, such as the contact being a suspected rebel or heretic, or less obvious ones—perhaps he is a double agent or some kind of xenos in disguise. While a player can come up with reasons as to why his contact is dangerous, he might also choose to let the GM decide the reason and keep it secret.

#### **Example**

*Augustus has a contact in the Administratum. He wants to get some official records changed to cover up his activities. His contact in the Administratum is only of Common reliability so he is really going to have to spin a tale to get this done. Fortunately, he has never asked his contact for a favour before so he incurs no penalties on his Test. Augustus is a Rank 3 Imperial Psyker and has an Intelligence of 42. Using all his wits, he tries to convince his contact to help. He needs to roll under 57, (42 + 15 for his Rank of 3). He scores a 34, and gets the records changed, expunging his dark deeds.*

Whenever a player uses a dangerous contact, the GM should make an Opposed Test with the player (keeping his results secret). If the GM rolls equal to or higher than the player, in addition to the contact being unhelpful, something has gone amiss. This usually means that either the contact has turned on the Acolyte or has done something that will bring Imperial authorities down on his head. What exactly happens is up to the GM and he is encouraged to work it into the plot. This might include such things as mercenaries turning up to try and kill the Acolyte or an arrest warrant being issued by the Adeptus Arbites in his name. At the very least, it is a licence for the GM to make something go wrong for the Acolyte during the game session.

#### **Losing Contacts**

Contacts can sometimes be lost during play, either though roleplaying or as part of the GMs plot. This is usually the result of someone coming after the Acolyte or his Inquisitor. Players should bear in mind that their contacts are not untouchable and are encouraged to keep them secret and protected, possibly even from their own master. Unless the player is directly responsible for the loss of his contact (his actions either directly or indirectly leading to the contact's death), then he should either be allowed to gain a new contact of the same xp cost or be reimbursed the contact's xp cost.

#### **Burning Contacts**

In certain circumstances, a GM might allow a player to ask something of his contact that the contact is not normally willing to give, losing him in the process. This is called "burning a contact". When a contact is burnt, he is doing the Acolyte "one last favour" and usually tries to do his best. If a contact is burnt for equipment or information, no roll is needed to find the item (though it must still be paid for) or to acquire the information (though he still cannot learn things he would not normally be able to). When burning a contact for a favour the player can add +30 bonus to the Test (no penalties should be applied). Once a contact is gone, he is gone forever and players do not regain xp lost in this way.

# Expanded Skills Exp anded Skills

*"The purpose of this instruction is not to deepen your understanding, but rather to broaden it. Ignorance, friends, is a virtue."* — Hyrum IX, to his students.

<span id="page-224-0"></span>Dark Heresy explores a broad range of Skills available to Acolytes, each of which offers a variety of uses and applications. The entries in the core rulebook, though, are just a foundation and as can be seen here, there are many more uses for the most common Skills. The expanded Skill entries that follow offer additional functions for Skills and are available to all characters. D

#### **Acrobatics (Advanced, Movement) Agility**

Useful for the Acolyte on the move, Acrobatics can be used in numerous situations to negate obstacles and circumvent treacherous conditions. Acrobatics can also provide a definitive edge when facing less agile foes.

#### **Hot Pursuit**

Normally, chasing after an opponent or fleeing from a pursuer is an Opposed Agility Test. To the acrobatic Acolyte, however, the environment can be a valuable tool, an advantage that allows the Acolyte to leap over railings, run along aerial walkways, jump across rooftops and careen down staircases. Whenever you are engaged in a pursuit through a congested area—crowds, difficult terrain, and so on, you may make an Acrobatics Test (in place of your Agility Test) for the Opposed Test.

#### **Negotiating Obstacles**

To a skilled acrobat, every obstacle is an opportunity, and every obstruction a challenge instead of a barrier. Whenever you Charge or Run through treacherous

#### **Pursuits**

At some time a character is bound to find himself involved in a chase, pursuing or being pursued by unfriendly heretics. This can be a thrilling component to roleplaying games, especially those involving dangerous environments, but such encounters can be a chore to run. To resolve pursuit simply, use the following rules.

#### **A Pursuit Dissected**

All pursuits occur in Detailed Time, so participants roll for Initiative and move as described in Dark Heresy. Where pursuit differs from normal combat encounters is in the tracking of Pursuit Points.

After rolling for Initiative, the character that acts first gains 1 Pursuit Point. On their Turn, each character involved in the pursuit, may take normal Actions (such as shooting at the fleeing opponent or pursuer, using a power, and so on). Alternatively, the character can Chase or Flee by making an Agility Test. The GM assigns the Difficulty based on the environment, with open areas being Easy (+30), while a densely packed marketplace would be Very Hard (–30). A success equals 1 Pursuit Point plus 1 Pursuit Point for each degree of success. A failure reduces the number of Pursuit Points by 1 and by another 1 point for a failure by two or more degrees. A failure by four or more degrees, reduces the Pursuit Points by 1d5. A character with negative Pursuit Points is effectively out of the chase or, for the fleeing character, pulled out of the chase. The first character to accumulate 10 Pursuit Points gets away or catches their prey, depending on who's doing the chasing or fleeing.

#### **Example**

*Karl runs away from a pair of drugged-up gangers who want his stylish boots. Karl's player rolls Initiative as normal (1d10+AB) and the GM rolls Initiative for the gang members (1d10+AB). Karl wins the Initiative, so he gains 1 Pursuit Point. On his Turn, he flees, so he Tests Agility. The GM rules that the streets are lightly congested, so the Test is Challenging (+0). Karl succeeds on the Test and gains a degree of success, netting him 2 more Pursuit Points for a total of 3. The gang members follow and Test Agility. The GM should Test them separately, which he does, with one succeeding and one failing, so one of the gang members falls behind. The other only succeeded, so he has just 1 Pursuit Point to Karl's 3. The chase continues over a number of Rounds until either Karl or the gang member achieves 10 Pursuit Points or until one breaks off the chase.*

#### **Slowing Pursuit**

If you're being chased, you can slow your pursuers by creating obstacles. There must be something to use—a crate of bottles, boxes, barrels, people and so on. Creating an obstacle reduces the number of Pursuit Points you would earn for a successful Agility Test in the Round by 1, however, you increase the Difficulty of your pursuers' Agility Tests by one-step.

#### **Distance**

While these pursuit rules are somewhat abstracted, actual distance is covered. For each Round of pursuit, the participants cover a number of metres equal to their Run movement.

terrain or through an area containing an obstacle, you may make an Acrobatics Test in place of an Agility Test to avoid falling Prone. You may also attempt an Acrobatics Test as a Free Action prior to moving at your normal rate through treacherous environments (but not environments made treacherous because of poor visibility).

#### **Tumbling Evasion**

When engaged with an opponent, you may Test Acrobatics to disengage as a Half Action instead of a Full Action. A successful Test allows you to move as if you had taken a Half Move Action without granting your opponent a free attack (see Fleeing in Dark Heresy on page 192). A failed Test means you still move, but your opponent gets a free attack with a +10 bonus.

#### **Awareness (Basic) Perception**

Easily one of the most important Skills to an investigator, as without this Skill, he is doomed to forever stumble into ambushes and traps, and to overlook vital clues.

#### **Eye for Detail**

Particularly perceptive Acolytes are trained to take in every aspect of a scene with just a quick scan, later recalling the subtlest of details that turn out to be critical to the investigation. Awareness cannot be used as an Investigation Skill in its own right, but it can be used to assist an Investigation Skill. When examining a crime scene, you may make an Awareness Test to attempt to notice any clues. Every degree of success reduces the Difficulty of a subsequent investigation Test by one-step.

#### **Example**

*Mattheus takes a quick look around the scene of a grisly ritual murder, but does not have time to carry out a lengthy investigation as his companions need him elsewhere. He makes an Awareness Test to notice any clues, getting two degrees of success. Later he comes to make an Inquiry Test, and recalls clues he spotted earlier, reducing the Difficulty of the Test by two-steps to Ordinary.* 

#### **GM Note: Using Awareness**

Given Awareness's importance to an Acolyte's mission, requiring characters lacking this Skill to Test at half their Perception may be too excessive, unduly penalising the player for a poor choice of Skills or slowing game play as the Acolytes fruitlessly scour the same area in search of that elusive clue. Rather than requiring all characters to Test Awareness, just have characters Test Perception. Those with the Awareness skill should face a lower Difficulty (usually two-steps) than those without.

#### **Barter (Basic) Fellowship**

Whether conducting menial chores in the marketplace before setting off on a mission, bribing guards to let you slip in the backdoor unnoticed, or negotiating for a choice piece of information, the Barter skill is always handy for minimising the impact to an Inquisitor's cred-stick.

#### **Bribery**

By first making a Barter Test, you can increase your chances of success with a subsequent Interaction Test by offering goods, services or cold, hard Thrones. A successful Barter Test and each degree of success beyond, grants you a +5 bonus on your next Interaction Test against your target made within a number of days equal to your Fellowship Bonus. The Difficulty of the Barter Test depends on the nature of the bribe as determined by the GM, who take in account the value of the bribe and the target's honesty and motivations.

#### **Blather (Advanced, Interaction) Fellowship**

Whilst unable to spin elaborate webs of lies as with Charm or Deceit, Blather is useful for baffling a guard long enough to escape, creating a distraction or stalling for time... or for coming up with a good excuse to feed your Inquisitor.

#### **Create Disturbance**

You may spew inane and nonsensical banter to create a distraction to divert attention from some other ally or event. If you have allies nearby who might benefit from the distraction—sneaking past a guard or picking their pocket, you may make a Blather Test to help them out. You make a Blather Test as normal and, if successful, use your Blather skill to assist your ally. Your opponent is dumbfounded as normal, although if your ally fails their own Test then the opponent may realise what is going on.

#### **Distract Opponent**

You can attempt to distract your opponent and conceal your hostile intentions. So long as you are not in combat and have not exhibited any hostile or overly confrontational actions towards your opponent, you may make a Blather Test opposed by your opponent's Willpower or Scrutiny. If you are successful you distract your opponent as though you had successfully feinted in combat, and so long as your next Action is a standard attack, it cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a standard attack then this advantage is lost. You may only use this function of Blather once per encounter.

#### **Carouse (Basic) Toughness**

Whilst excessive drinking is hardly encouraged by the Inquisition, only the most puritanical of Inquisitors would begrudge their Acolytes a drink or two. In addition to its primary use for relaxing, many an important clue or tip-off has been gained whilst carousing in a none too salubrious establishment, and only Acolytes who can hold their amasec stand any chance of remembering it come the morning.

#### **Drinking Contests**

A drinking contest, whether in the form of a competition to drink alcohol the fastest or to be the last man standing, is simply an Opposed Carouse Test. The consequences for failure are usually embarrassing rather than harmful, although this does depend on the drink consumed.

### <span id="page-226-0"></span>**More Than Human: Unnatural Characteristics, Test and Skills**

#### **Explained**

Certain creatures and antagonists have the Unnatural Characteristic trait representing a superhuman level of ability in one or more areas. Each Unnatural trait has a multiplier illustrating just how great the ability is (×2, ×3, etc.) which applies in the following ways:

The Characteristic Bonus is the first digit of their Characteristic score multiplied by the amount in brackets. For example: an Ogryn with Unnatural Strength (×2) and a Strength Characteristic of 43, would have a Strength Bonus of 8 (4×2=8).

Note that Unnatural Agility whilst increasing the AB, does not affect the creature's Move Rate—this is a separate Trait, Unnatural Speed (see Dark Heresy page 333).

When taking a Skill Test based upon a Characteristic with the Unnatural trait, the base Difficulty of the Test is staged downwards one level for degree of multiplier past normal (to maximum of +30), For example: the Archmagos Voltaic has a Dark Age of Technology cortical implant giving him Unnatural Intelligence (×3). He is called on to repair a damaged plasma core using his Intelligence based Tech Use skill. Normally this would be a Very Hard (–30) Test, but thanks to his Unnatural Intelligence the Difficulty is reduced by two stages to Difficult (–10), (–1 stage for ×2, and –1 for ×3).

During Opposed Characteristic Tests, where success is achieved, the Unnatural multiplier is added to the degrees of success. In the case of a tie, the participant without the Unnatural Characteristic trait loses the Opposed Test. For example: Garm Felbood is struggling with a tentacled monstrosity from the swamps of Dusk. Garm has Strength 40 and the thing from the swamp has Strength 33 (Unnatural (×2)). Garm rolls 20 (two degrees of success) and the thing rolls 30 (straight success), unfortunately the thing adds +2 degrees of success because of its (×2) modifier, bringing the Opposed Test to a draw. This translates to a victory to the swamp thing as it has Unnatural Strength and poor old Garm does not!

#### **Iron Stomach**

Acolytes who spend a great deal of time ingesting drugs and alcohol find that they develop a tolerance for a whole host of toxins. Whenever you knowingly consume something that is poisonous or toxic, you may make a Carouse Test in place of the Toughness Test. This use does not apply to poisons or toxins that have been injected, applied to weapons or delivered by any other non-oral methods.

#### **Charm (Basic, Interaction) Fellowship**

One of the more vital tools available to Acolytes in their pursuit of the witch and heretic, Charm allows you to instil feeling of kinship and companionability in those you meet. A successful Test can make friends out of foes, bank the fires of anger and get you into places where the bullet would otherwise fail.

#### **Compel**

You can convince a target to do something they otherwise might not do by laying it on thick with flattery or encouragement. You can compel the target, effectively improving his Disposition by two-steps instead of the normal one-step, by accepting a –20 penalty to your Charm Test. The target does as you ask, but afterwards he is entitled to an Intelligence Test to realise he has been used. If he succeeds, his Disposition worsens by three steps.

On a failed Charm Test to compel, the target's Disposition drops by one-step.

#### **First Impressions**

First impressions last, as the old Imperial adage goes, and it will do you well to keep this in mind as you make your way through the universe. When you first encounter a character, you may make a Charm Test to leave them with a positive impression, making subsequent Interaction Skill Tests onestep easier until you fail a Skill Test or commit some breach of etiquette or social blunder. Of course, if you fail this Test your attempt has the opposite effect, making Interaction Skill Tests one-step more difficult.

#### **Chem-Use (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

The life of an Acolyte is one fraught with peril, with hidden dangers everywhere as enemies of the Imperium do their best to survive under the oppressive weight of the Inquisition. Since many foes lack the firepower to mount significant opposition against the agents of the Inquisition, many resort to cowardly tactics in the forms of poisons, toxins and other vile substances to confuse, injure or kill their enemies. Chem-Use, then, can serve as the first line of defence against these vile weapons, while also giving the Acolyte the tools to concoct filthy brews of his own.

#### **Alien Toxins**

From the unholy cocktails imbued with the warp by Chaos cultists to the strange and lethal venom of the Tyranids, the galaxy brims with an appalling assortment of venoms and poisons, all of which are available if you know the right place to look. Normally, when you encounter a toxin, you may Test Chem-Use to identify it (see Detecting Poisons). If you fail this Test, you may still use the toxin, but the Difficulty worsens by two-steps.

#### **Concealing Poisons**

Whenever you want to introduce a toxin into a target's food, drink or air and want to conceal your activity, you may make a Difficult (–10) Chem-Use Test to administer the chemical in a way the victim may not detect. On a success, you apply the poison normally. However, for each degree of success, you worsen the Difficulty of the Chem-Use Test made later to identify the toxin from the victim's remains.

#### <span id="page-227-0"></span>**Detecting Poisons**

You may use Chem-Use when analysing the remains of a victim to detect toxins and chemicals buried in the flesh. Provided you have a toxinwand or a chymistry lab, a successful Chem-Use Test reveals the absence or presence of such a substance. Each degree of success reveals one more component of the substance, including such things as what it is, its method of delivery, and the most likely places where it can be procured.

If you lack proper equipment, you take a –20 penalty on your Chem-Use Test. Other factors can modify the Difficulty, including the quality of the remains, attempts to mask the substance chemically, or even the nature of the substance itself.

#### **Ciphers (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, Occult, Secret Society, Underworld and War Cant.

Ciphers is the ability to communicate in a specific code, a language developed by a group to conceal the contents of their conversations. Many Inquisitors develop their own Ciphers to communicate their instructions to their Acolytes, while also giving a vital tool for use between their servants while on missions. Whilst the Skill Groups for this Skill are quite broad, you can make them more specific, effectively creating sub-groups for each sub-skill. When using the Ciphers skill to discern or translate the meaning of the code of which you do not actually know, but is within a Skill Group for which you are trained, you may Test Ciphers normally, but at a –20 penalty.

#### **Countermeasures**

When a cipher is cracked by the enemy, it usually means bad news for those groups who rely on it, leading to misinformation and signs laid by the enemy that lead them into traps. If you suspect that your cipher has been cracked or that someone is using it to feed you bad information, you may make a Cipher Test opposed by your opponent's Cipher Test. Success indicates that you have worked out that something is wrong, giving you the opportunity to turn the tables on your opponent. Failure indicates that you are none the wiser to the subterfuge. The GM always rolls both sides of the Opposed Test in secret to avoid tipping you off that something is up.

#### **Deciphering <sup>a</sup> Cipher**

Once you have identified a cipher, the meaning remains hidden unless it can first be deciphered. The easiest way to decipher a cipher is to capture someone who already knows its meaning and then persuade them to reveal its secrets. Otherwise, the task becomes a lot harder, requiring days of painstaking code cracking and number crunching, and even then you may only be able to decipher this particular message and not crack the entire cipher. Cracking a cipher is an Investigation Test with a Hard benchmark, meaning that Tests to overcome it are at a –20 penalty. The process takes one month. You may use raw Intelligence, or your Logic or Scholastic Lore (Cryptology) as the Investigation Skill. Successfully interrogating or bribing someone who knows the code may reduce the benchmark of the investigation or negate the need for a roll at all.

#### **Climb (Basic, Movement) Strength**

Whether breaking into a cultist stronghold, clambering up scaffolding to find a good place for sniping at your enemies, or scrambling up a tree to escape from the snapping jaws of some alien beast, Climb is a useful Skill to have.

#### **Abseiling**

You may make a Climb Test in place of Strength when abseiling. See Chapter VII: Playing the Game in Dark Heresy for details.

#### **Helping Others Climb**

You may help novice climbers climb by setting up guide ropes for them, pointing out good hand holds or physically helping them up. You may assist another person with a Climb Test, even if they don't have the Skill themselves.

#### **Rappel**

You can descend more quickly when rappelling ropes are in place. When using ropes to rappel, you may Test Climb to safely descend at a speed of three times your normal Move Rate. A failed Test means you make no progress. A failed Test by one or more degrees means that you have become tangled up in the rope and must succeed on a Climb Test on the following Round to free yourself. A failed Test by three or more degrees means that a dreadful mishap has occurred and you fall, taking Damage as normal.

#### **Speed Climbing**

You may climb more quickly by taking an additional penalty on your Climb Test. By worsening the Test's Difficulty by –20, you can ascend or descend at your normal Move Rate instead of half your Move rate.

#### **Command (Basic) Fellowship**

As you rise in Ranks and esteem in the eyes of your Inquisitor, you ought to invest in Command so that when the day comes that you attain the Rank of Inquisitor yourself, you will be better able to lead your own Acolytes. Even before this distant and unlikely day of glory, Command has its uses, allowing you the ability to exert your influence over citizens, soldiers and more.

#### **Compel**

This expanded function works just like the Charm function except it applies to Command Tests. For details, see Charm.

#### **Devoted Followers**

Whenever you succeed on a Command Test to issue an order to an NPC who is Devoted or Fanatical (see Dispositions on page 230 in Dark Heresy) you grant a +5 bonus on a single Test related to that order for every degree of success attained. Multiple successful Tests are not cumulative and the benefits of a successful Test remain for a number of hours equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

#### **Instil Loyalty**

The greater the respect that your minions have for you, the greater your influence over them. You can improve the Disposition of your followers by making a Command Test while giving them a rousing speech, handing out medals or offering them encouragement. This Test takes a few minutes and a successful Test improves the target's Disposition by one-step. The improved Disposition remains until circumstances or your behaviour gives them cause to change.

#### **Common Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

<span id="page-228-0"></span>IX: Life as an Acolyte

**Skill Group:** Adeptus Arbites, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Creed, Imperial Guard, Imperium, Machine Cult, Tech, Underworld and War. Other Common Lores may be available at the GMs discretion.

Much as its name suggests, the Common Lore skill is possessed by every Acolyte in some capacity, representing the little snippets of local knowledge and information picked up when growing up in a place or inside an organisation. Such knowledge, whilst overshadowed by more scholarly Skills, should never be underestimated, as knowing just the right thing to say, place to hide or contact to meet can be the difference between success and failure, life and death.

#### **Famous Stratagems**

Whenever you would be called upon to make a Scholastic Lore (Tactica Imperialis) Test, you may instead make a Common Lore (Imperial Guard or War) Test, but at a –20 penalty, so long as the Test relates to famous battles or strategies.

#### **Local Knowledge**

For all a navigator's charts and maps, sometimes nothing beats local knowledge. You may make a Common Lore (Imperium, or other related lore) to see if you know anything useful about the local area. If successful you gain a +10 bonus to the next Navigation or Survival Test made in the same locale.

#### **Practices and Procedures**

A little knowledge about an organisation's practises and procedures goes a long way to smoothing things over when dealing with them. You may make a relevant Common Lore Test prior to dealing with members of an organisation. If successful, you gain a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests made when dealing with them.

#### **Red Tape**

Knowledge of the inside workings of the Administratum can give you the means to cut through endless layers of bureaucracy. When requesting information or assistance from the Administratum as part of an investigation, you may make a Common Lore (Administratum) or Scholastic Lore (Bureaucracy) Test. If successful, you may reduce the time taken by a further two hours for every degree of success. Alternatively, you can attempt to delay an attempt to get information by an enemy, increasing the time taken by two hours for every degree of success.

On a failed Test, you increase the time taken by two hours plus two hours for every degree of failure, or if delaying an enemy, decrease the time taken by two hours plus two hours for every degree of failure.

#### **Example**

*In the effort to track down a bit of elusive information, you research in the depths of an Administratum building, requesting data-slates on various suspects. As normal, you Test Scholastic Lore. Since the investigation counts as Drudging, it normally takes 24 hours. However, you succeeded on the Test, roll a 2 on your 1d10 and add your Intelligence Bonus of 5 for a total of 7. The investigation now takes 17 hours. But, you are in a bit of a hurry so try to cut through the red tape. You make a Common Lore (Administratum) Test and get two degrees of success. The investigation is further reduced by four hours, to 13 hours. Still a long night, but not as long now that the bureaucrats are on your side.*

#### **Concealment (Basic) Agility**

Sometimes there's no better option than to just hide from your enemies, whether it be from a rampaging Chaos Titan, a unit of corrupt Arbitraitors, or the guards of a townhouse that you have just violated. A successful Concealment Test may allow you to slip away, unseen and unnoticed, to continue your service to the God-Emperor.

#### **Camouflage**

Whenever you would attempt to conceal another character, you can Test Concealment and apply the results of your Test for that character. The effects of a successful Test remain only so long as that character has the benefit of cover, reduced visibility (fog, foliage, etc.), and does not move. If the concealed character moves, he is no longer concealed.

#### **Sniping**

Whenever you attack an enemy while successfully hidden, you automatically reveal your presence. You can attempt a Concealment Test as a Half Action to duck back under cover, but your opponents gain a +20 bonus to their Awareness Tests.

#### **Taking Time to Hide**

Normally a Concealment Test is a Half Action, representing you ducking behind cover or out of sight. However, if you take longer to conceal yourself, you have a better chance of remaining hidden. For every additional five minutes you take to hide yourself (or another), you gain a +10 bonus to the Concealment Test, to a maximum of +30 for taking 15 minutes to hide.

#### **Contortionist (Basic, Combat) Agility**

Don't underestimate the Contortionist skill. With it, you're not only harder to pin down, capture or generally tie up, but you can reach places others can't follow.

#### **Hiding in Odd Spaces**

You may make a Contortionist Test in place of a Concealment Test if you use the Skill to hide in an odd place, such as an air vent or oil drum.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Slippier than a Greased Kroot**

The contortionist's life is made all the more easier with the help of grease, helping him to slip out of hitherto impossible bonds. If you can first grease your body in some way, such as with oil, you gain a +10 bonus to all Contortionist Tests.

#### **Deceive (Basic, Interaction) Fellowship**

Unlike the quick-fire distraction of Blather, Deceit is far subtler and more useful in the long term. It can be used to convince an enemy that you are there to help, a guard that you really have just found the corpse in the room, or a merchant to invest his hard-earned Thrones into your "scheme".

#### **Acting**

When pretending to be someone other than who you are, such as when you use the Disguise skill, you may Test Deceive to enhance your disguise. A successful Test Opposed by your opponent's Scrutiny grants you a +10 bonus to all Disguise Tests made for a number of minutes equal to your Fellowship Bonus. You may only use this feature if you are communicating with someone and you must make a successful Deceive Test before Testing Disguise.

#### **Compel**

This expanded function works just like the Charm function except it applies to Deceive Tests. For details, see Charm.

#### **The Con**

The Deceive skill can be used to "con" a victim. When conning—that is, misleading him for any length of time for your own gain—you may make a Deceive Test in place of another Interaction Skill, such as Charm.

#### **Soothing Platitudes**

Not all lies are bad, and sometimes a tactful white lie here or there can smooth the way. You may make a Deceive Test to convince another character of some falsehood, whether in the form of a compliment or a plain deception. If you succeed on an Opposed Deceive Test against your opponent's Scrutiny Test, you gain a +10 bonus on Interaction Tests against that target for a number of minutes equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

#### **Demolition (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

Despite the constant drilling to be cautious and subtle by their masters, most Acolytes love to blow things up. The Demolition skill is useful for making sure it's not themselves.

#### **Booby-Traps**

A booby-trap is an explosive device intended as a trap. It is planted as a normal explosive, but typically with a proximity trigger designed to go off when a door or package is opened. An Awareness Test Opposed by the Demolition Test to plant the booby-trap may be made to notice it before it goes off.

#### **Detecting Explosives**

Normally an explosive device is located using the Awareness skill (to physically notice the device) or Security skill (to detect it using sensors). You may use the Demolition skill to find an explosive device (if you are using your own knowledge of planting explosives to find the most logical place where it could be placed). In all cases, the Test to detect the explosive is Opposed by the Demolition Test made to plant the explosive.

#### **Explosive Entry**

Sometimes, when there isn't enough time to bypass a lock manually or a doorway proves too much of an obstacle, only a well-placed explosive charge will do. If you have a small amount of explosive, either in the form of a shaped charge or a carefully placed grenade, you may make a Demolition Test instead of a Security Test to bypass a lock. Success indicates that the lock or door is destroyed, allowing access but probably alerting any guards. Failure indicates that the lock is destroyed but the door remains sealed, the explosives failed to detonate, or that the explosion emanates outwards instead of inwards, catching anyone nearby in the blast.

#### **Repurpose Explosive**

Whenever you successfully locate a bomb or some other explosive device, you can alter its trigger mechanism so that it detonates when you want it to rather than when the original demolitionist wanted. Resolve this as an Opposed Demolitions Test, with a success on your part allowing you to reset the bomb as if you had planted it, thereby allowing you to make all decisions about the explosive as normal. A failed Test indicates that you are unable to alter the explosive without first defusing it. A catastrophic failure by five or more degrees indicates that the bomb goes off.

#### **Disguise (Basic) Fellowship**

Whether pretending to be the servant of a corrupt noble, infiltrating a sinister cult or lying low in a vile dive, the Disguise skill is handy for helping you be someone you're not. Of course there is more to a good disguise than appearances, but this Skill goes a long way to giving you the best possible chance of remaining undetected.

#### **Disguise Voice**

You can use the Disguise skill to alter your voice so that you sound like someone else. If you simply want to change the tone of your voice in a way that you are unrecognisable, simply Test Disguise as normal. If you want to alter your voice so that it matches someone else, you must spend at least a week (minus your Intelligence Bonus in days) training your voice by listening to and replicating recordings of the specific voice. Impersonating a voice is always a Difficult (–10) Test or Hard (–20) if the person is particularly well known.

#### **Impersonation**

Generally, a Disguise Test allows you to pretend to be a nameless, faceless individual, someone that may fit with expectations for a particular location or area. Such anonymity is useful in getting into places where ordinarily you couldn't, but sometimes even a good disguise is not enough. Sometimes you must become someone else. You may use Disguise to impersonate another person. You must have prosthetics, a pict or holo-pict of the person's likeness, and other useful tools. Impersonating a specific person is always a Hard (–20) Test or Very Hard (–30) if the person is particularly famous.

#### **Look the Part**

With an appropriate disguise, you can make your lies easier to digest, such as disguising yourself as a messenger when trying to bluff your way past the guards on the front door. If you make a successful Disguise Test you may gain a +10 bonus to any related Deceive Tests, so long as the disguise makes the deceit all the more believable.

#### **Dodge (Basic, Combat) Agility**

Who doesn't like to be able to leap out of the way of lasfire or flying punches? Since Dodge enables you to avoid injury, negating attacks of just about any sort, it is a vital Skill for your survival.

#### **Dive for Cover**

Whenever you are allowed to make a Dodge Test to negate an attack, you may instead make a Difficult (–10) Dodge Test to dive behind cover. To use this feature, the cover must be within two metres of you. If the Test succeeds, you not only negate the attack, but also move behind the covering obstacle.

#### **Protect Ally**

You may also use Dodge to put yourself in the path of an attack made against an ally. Whenever you are adjacent to an ally and that ally is attacked, you may make a Difficult (–10) Dodge Test to swap your position with that of your ally. If the Test succeeds, you are attacked instead.

#### **Drive (Advanced, Operator) Agility**

**Skill Group:** Ground Vehicle, Hover Vehicle and Walker.

Only those Acolytes from the most technologically backward of worlds are incapable of driving a vehicle, but those with the skills to drive under pressure are altogether rarer. But the ability to shake off pursuers through traffic or give chase in a speeder through dangerously built-up streets comes in very handy indeed.

#### **Hiding in Traffic**

Sometimes, when you're being pursued in a vehicle, the easiest place to lose pursuers is to hide in plain sight—in traffic. So long as there are lots of other similar vehicles to hide amongst, you may make a Drive Test in place of a Concealment Test to Oppose your pursuers' Awareness Test to spot you, driving casually and blending in with the traffic.

#### **Forcing a Vehicle to a Halt**

If you are close to another vehicle that is the same size or smaller, and you are both going at the same speed, you may make an Opposed Drive Test to force the other vehicle to a halt. If you succeed, the other driver must brake to avoid hitting you, is forced off the road or brought to a halt by virtue of colliding with your own vehicle. This may inflict Damage on one or both vehicles, but either way the vehicle is stopped. If you fail, it is your vehicle that is brought to sudden halt, letting the other vehicle escape unhindered.

#### **Evaluate (Basic, Investigation) Intelligence**

Knowing the true worth of an item puts an Acolyte at an advantage when bartering for goods or services.

#### **Bartering**

If you first successfully Evaluate an item, every degree of success grants you a +10 bonus on a subsequent Barter Test made to acquire or sell that item.

#### **Forbidden Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Adeptus Mechanicus, Archeotech, The Black Library, Cults, Daemonology, Heresy, Inquisition, Mutants, Ordos, Psykers, Warp and Xenos.

For all an Inquisitor might try to school his Acolytes in treating Forbidden Lore with fear and caution, few listen and often find out more than they probably should. The wariest of Acolytes keep this knowledge safe for times of great need—the more foolhardy are likely to find themselves in trouble indeed.

#### **Forbidden Goods**

You may make a Forbidden Lore Test instead of an Evaluate Test, to calculate the (often priceless) value of a forbidden artefact or try to learn something about its history or purpose. Of course, peddling forbidden artefacts is often treated as a worse crime than simply possessing them, usually ending in execution... or worse.

#### **Forbidden Procedures**

A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing when dealing with forbidden lore, but can still ingratiate you with an organisation all the quicker. You may make a relevant Forbidden Lore Test prior to dealing with members of an organisation. If successful you gain a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests made when dealing with them.

#### **Gamble (Basic) Intelligence**

Whilst most Inquisitors would view playing cards as a waste of time, others concede it can be a great way to get in with the right circles, to say nothing of passing the time between missions.

#### **Baleful Consequences**

Sometimes being big or carrying a large stick can be useful for more than just getting people to do what you want sometimes you can convince them that there are far worse consequences than losing money if they don't let you win. Before making a Gamble Test, you may first make a Difficult (–10) Intimidation Test. On a success, you gain a +5 bonus on related Gamble Tests. On a failure, you take a –5 penalty on these Tests.

#### **Off Guard**

The wily Acolyte catches others off guard by lulling them into a false sense of security with an innocent hand of cards. You may make a Gamble Test to calm down tensions and ingratiate yourself with others. If successful, you gain a +10 bonus to your next interaction or Inquiry Test made with them, as they are likely to be more disposed towards you.

#### **Risk**

Life is a gamble, and your familiarity around the gaming table and understanding of the odds can aid you outside of a game of tiles. As a Full Action in combat, you may attempt a Hard (–20) Gamble Test. On a success, you gain a +10 bonus that can apply to any one Test made for the duration of the encounter. On a failure, you take a –10 penalty that applies to a single Test made during the encounter as determined by the GM. You may only use Risk once per encounter.

#### **Inquiry (Basic, Investigation) Fellowship**

As an agent of the Inquisition, your principle responsibility is investigation, seeking out the heretic and witch and bringing them to justice. Inquiry is a vital tool regardless of your career since it enables you to get a sense of the environment, learn clues and aid you in your ongoing search for enemies of the Imperium.

#### **Asking Around**

You may make an Inquiry Test to find out if anyone has been asking questions about you, your colleagues or anything else you might be on the hunt for. This is Opposed by the Inquiry Test of anyone asking such questions.

#### **False Rumours**

Just as you rely on rumours to find answers, so to can you plant false rumours to throw an enemy off your trail. You may make an Inquiry Test to plant such rumours for others to <span id="page-232-0"></span>discover. A successful Test increases the Difficulty of your opponent's Inquiry Test by one plus one-step for each degree of success.

#### **Lines of Inquiry**

You can use Inquiry as a very light form of interrogation, attempting to find information by asking seemingly innocent questions of the subject. In place of an Interrogation Test, you may instead make a Hard (–20) Inquiry Test. You are never at risk of inflicting Fatigue or Damage with this Test.

#### **Intimidate (Basic, Interaction) Strength**

Intimidation is neither big nor clever, but sometimes the ability to terrify an opponent into submission can come in useful for an Acolyte, getting far more done than with polite words alone.

#### **Carry a Big Gun**

You may back up your stern words with the threat of force, typically symbolised by a very large gun. So long as your weapon is bigger, or deals more Damage, than anything your opponent has, you gain a +10 bonus on your Intimidation Test.

#### **FEAR THE INQUISITION!**

You may make an Intimidation Test, coupled with liberal displays of authority and marks of office, to put the fear of the Inquisition into your opponent. On a successful Test you may add +10 to a subsequent Interrogation Test made against anyone who is at least familiar with the unpleasant rumours surrounding the Inquisition. Higher ranking members of the Inquisition, Daemon princes and Space Marine captains are less likely to be bothered by an Acolyte spouting such rhetoric, so the results of the Test are subject to the GMs discretion.

#### **Fearsome Glare**

Normally, using Intimidate is a Full Action, but sometimes you need to cow your opponent quickly to keep the target in place while attending to a more significant threat. You may Test Intimidate as a Half Action, but the Difficulty worsens by one-step. Furthermore, if you succeed, the effects of the Test last for just 1 Round.

#### **Scare Factor**

Whilst Intimidate normally requires you to be able to make yourself understood, you can attempt to scare or cow a group of people or creatures who do not speak your language (or any language) by the power of gesture and shouting alone. Using Intimidate in this way requires at least a Difficult (–10) Test.

#### **Obey My Command!**

You may abandon the tactfulness of command and resort to fear to ensure that your underlings obey. If you succeed on a Difficult (–10) Intimidate Test, you get a +5 bonus on all Command Tests against targets you intimidated for a number of minutes equal to your Strength Bonus. A failed Test indicates that you take a –5 penalty on such Tests.

#### **Invocation (Advanced) Willpower**

Whilst it is not always possible to take the time to properly focus a Psychic Power, most psykers would strongly urge a budding Acolyte to make the time. Psykers who might have advocated the opposite, urging a carefree approach, are rarely sane enough to offer such advice.

#### **Protective Invocation**

You may use Invocation to draw psychic wards and sigils about you, summon up your mental energies and fortify your will against attack. Doing so requires an Invocation Test, and if successful you gain a +10 bonus for every degree of success to the next Willpower Test made to resist a Psychic Power. A failure by three or more degrees indicates you have botched the wards in a significant way, imposing a –10 penalty to your next Test instead. For every degree of failure above three, the penalty worsens by an additional –10.

#### **Lip Reading (Advanced) Perception**

Although far less technical than a surveillance auspex, the Lip Reading skill is a relatively foolproof way of "listening" in to the conversations of others, useful for undercover Acolytes or those caught unprepared.

#### **Lip Speaking**

You may use your Lip Reading skill to communicate discretely with another person in your line of sight, either hiding coded messages in regular conversation or mouthing a message to them. You only need to make a Lip Reading Test to hide words in normal conversation, not to simply mouth a message, but the recipient must make a Lip Reading Test either way to successfully interpret the message. If either Test is failed then the message is not conveyed properly.

#### **Example**

*Mattheus and Ruthe are undercover at the Governor's ball. Mattheus is trying to mouth the words "get out, they've spotted you" to his colleague across the other side of the room. If he mouths the words to Ruthe, only Ruthe needs to make a Lip Reading Test. However, this might prove to be a bit obvious, so whilst in conversation with the Governor's wife, he may try to include the message in his conversation for Ruthe to see, in which case both Mattheus and Ruthe must make a Lip Reading Test. Both pass the Test and Ruthe gets out just in time!*

#### **Literacy (Advanced) Intelligence**

Literacy is another vital tool for those in service of the Inquisition, since any investigation that requires research into ancient texts, communication by discrete means or even reading instructions left by the Inquisitor, makes Literacy more than just a quaint option but a requirement for the job.

#### **Speed Reading**

Sometimes you might not have the luxury of time to spend an hour flicking through a tome to find the proper warding rituals. In such hurried cases, you may make a Difficult (–10) Literacy Test to skim through the text to find what you are looking for, allowing you to read a page of text in a Round. However, you are unable to get more than a sense of meaning or find a specific phrase or section by doing this.

#### **Logic (Basic) Intelligence**

Inquisitors value servants with the ability to crack mathematical formulae, codes and other puzzles, and those with extensive training in Logic can rise far, provided they keep their keen minds where they belong and do not dabble into the forbidden.

#### **Analysing Clues**

Late in an investigation, once the clues are all in place, you may use your Logic skill to try to put it all together and bring the investigation to a conclusion. You may use Logic as an Investigation Skill, making a Logic Test alongside another Investigation Skill Test. If both are successful, you may roll an additional 1d10 and subtract the roll from the amount of time taken to carry out the investigation.

#### **Code Cracking**

You may use Logic as an Investigation Skill when attempting to decipher a cipher. See the Cipher skill on [page](#page-227-0)  [227](#page-227-0) for more information on how to do this.

#### **Epiphany**

Once per game session, when you are stumped at an impasse or otherwise confronted with a problem you can't quite overcome, you may make a Very Hard (–30) Logic Test to conjure up an idea from the depths of your mind. On a success, the GM may grant you a hint, nudge you in the right direction or offer some other previously overlooked clue to aid you in your investigation.

#### **Mathemechanica Rituals**

Tech-priests know the mathemechanical formulae to coax a machine-spirit into behaving itself. You may make a Logic Test to recall the correct rituals and incantations, and, if successful, gain +10 to a Tech-Use Test made at the same time. Alternatively, you may use your Logic to assist another Acolyte's Tech-Use skill.

#### **Sooth Machine-Spirits**

You know the rites and rituals to placate an angry machine-spirit, coaxing it to cooperate. In the event of a weapon or equipment malfunction or Jamming, you may make a Difficult (–10) Logic Test to coax the machine-spirit into behaving itself. If the Test is successful, the weapon does not Jam or the piece of equipment does not malfunction.

#### **Medicae (Advanced) Intelligence**

Injury comes with the job of being an Acolyte and, for this reason, most teams include at least one member with some familiarity with Medicae, or at least have access to someone who does. Medicae enables you to patch up comrades, pull an ally from the brink of death, administer drugs and point out the best place to stick a needle to cause optimum pain.

#### **Diagnose**

You can diagnose what's wrong with a patient by succeeding on a Medicae Test. The GM rolls for you in secret. A success reveals the most basic trouble, with each degree of success revealing an additional useful fact. A failure reveals nothing, while a failure by three or more degrees results in a misdiagnosis with often spectacularly awful results if the physician is allowed to treat the patient. Examples include poisoning, lopping off the incorrect limb, replacing organs unnecessarily and so on.

#### **First Aid**

As described in Dark Heresy, First Aid is one of the most common uses of the Medicae skill in that it allows you to treat an injured companion quickly, by staunching his wounds and getting him back on his feet. The amount of Damage removed with a First Aid Test depends on the Injury Level of the patient as shown on the following table:

| Injury Level | Damage Removed     |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Light        | Intelligence Bonus |
| Heavy        | 1 point            |
| Critical     | 1 point            |

Generally, a Medicae Test to provide First Aid is Challenging (+0), but the severity as well as the type of injury can also have an effect. As an optional rule, you can use the following Difficulties for performing First Aid on injured characters. This method requires players to keep track of the type of Damage they've taken. As well, a Medicae Test is made to repair a specific set of injuries, each Test attending to a particular type of injuries. The Injury Level applies to total Damage taken, so even if the target only took 1 point of Energy Damage and 6 points of Explosive Damage, that same target would still count as Heavily Injured.

| —Difficulty by Type— |             |            |  |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|--|
| Injury Level         | Energy      | Explosive  |  |
| Light                | Challenging | Difficult  |  |
|                      | (+0)        | (–10)      |  |
| Heavy                | Difficult   | Hard (–20) |  |
|                      | (–10)       | (–10)      |  |
| Critical             | Difficult   | Very Hard  |  |
|                      | (–10)       | (–30)      |  |

| —Difficulty by Type— |             |             |  |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|--|
| Injury Level         | Impact      | Rending     |  |
| Light                | Ordinary    | Challenging |  |
|                      | (+10)       | (+0)        |  |
| Heavy                | Challenging | Difficult   |  |
|                      | (+0)        | (–10)       |  |
| Critical             | Difficult   | Hard        |  |
|                      | (–10)       | (–20)       |  |

#### **Example**

*When Julius takes a nasty hit from a laspistol and falls to the ground, a curl of smoke rising from the burn hole through his chest, Lucian rushes to his ally's side. Looking him over, he sees he's taken Critical Damage and can't take another hit. Since Julius has taken Critical Energy Damage, Lucian has to pass a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to remove 1 point of Damage. It's not much, but it might give his ally a chance to survive the firefight.* 

**Limits on First Aid:** If you're not using the optional rules described here, a character can benefit from First Aid just once per combat encounter, even when attended by multiple healers. If you're using the optional rules, a character can receive First Aid for each type of Damage taken. So a character who has taken only Explosive Damage can only receive First Aid once, while a character who has taken Energy and Explosive Damage could received two uses of First Aid, one for each set of injuries.

#### **Other Uses**

A person trained in Medicae can also attend to other injuries beyond Damage.

**Blood Loss:** A Difficult (–10) Medicae Test halts Blood Loss. If the subject is still fighting or has moved while suffering from Blood Loss, the Test is Very Hard (–30) instead.

**Broken Limbs:** A Difficult (–10) Medicae Test is required to safely remove a necrotised limb (which results from a failed Toughness Test made to resist limb loss from a broken limb). A failed Test deals 1d10 points of Damage to the limb location, ignoring Armour. Note that a failed Test also results in Blood Loss.

#### **Install Implants and Bionic Components**

The Medicae skill also allows you the ability to install replacement limbs and organs. To do so, you must have the implant or bionic device handy. The Test Difficulty depends on the unit, its quality and the facilities available. The process of implantation always takes 2d10 days minus one day per point of the patient's Toughness Bonus (to a minimum of one day). The following table describes the Test Difficulties for this procedure. All Difficulties are cumulative. If you have also have the Tech-Use skill, you gain a +10 bonus on Medicae Tests to install implants and bionic components. **Failed Tests**

| Table 9-2: Implants & Bionic Components    |                  |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Unit                                       | Difficulty       |
| Bionic Arm                                 | Challenging (+0) |
| Bionic Locomotion                          | Difficult (–10)  |
| Bionic Respiratory System                  | Hard (–20)       |
| Chem Gland†                                | Difficult (–10)  |
| Concealed Weapon Bionic                    | Challenging (+0) |
| Hermetic Infusion†                         | Very Hard (–30)  |
| Implant Systems                            |                  |
| Augur Array                                | Challenging (+0) |
| Ballistic Mechadendrite                    | Difficult (–10)  |
| Cortex Implant                             | Hard (–20)       |
| Cybernetic Senses                          | Difficult (–10)  |
| Manipulator Mechadendrite                  | Challenging (+0) |
| Medicae Mechadendrite                      | Difficult (–10)  |
| Mind Impulse Unit                          | Challenging (+0) |
| Optical Mechadendrite                      | Challenging (+0) |
| Utility Mechadendrite                      | Challenging (+0) |
| Injector Rig†                              | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Mining Helot Augmetics†                    | Routine (+20)    |
| Rite of Setesh†                            | Very Hard (–30)  |
| Vehicle Interface Circuitry†               | Ordinary (+10)   |
| †<br>Described in this sourcebook.         |                  |
| Quality                                    | Difficulty       |
| Poor                                       | Difficult (–10)  |
| Common                                     | Challenging (+0) |
| Good                                       | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Facility                                   | Difficulty       |
| Dreadful (in the field)                    | Hard (–20)       |
| Poor (field medicae tent, Rogue Trader)    | Difficult (–10)  |
| Common (hospital)                          | Challenging (+0) |
| Good (quality hospital)                    | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Excellent (Inquisitor's personal hospital) | Routine (+20)    |

#### **Example**

*Fenswick, an armsman, has lost his arm in a battle with a savage Ork and though he killed the wretched greenskin, he's in bad shape. Rushed to a field hospital, a surgeon works to install a bionic arm. The procedure is Challenging (+0) to start, however, the limb is good and thus improves the Difficulty by +10 to Ordinary (+10). Unfortunately, the facilities are poor, imposing a –10 penalty, bring the Test back down to Challenging (+0).*

A failed Medicae Test to install an implant or bionic unit can have nasty consequences. A simple failure reduces the quality of the unit by one-step. If the unit was poor to begin with, the unit doesn't work at all and could, in the case of a vital system, kill the patient. A failure by three or more degrees means that the limb breaks and the procedure seriously injures the patient, dealing 2d10 points of Rending Damage to the affected location (ignoring Armour Points). A failure by five or more degrees results in the death of the patient, the ruin of the device and 1d10 Insanity Points to all who witness the appalling mishap.

#### **Extended Care**

Extended care is covered in detail in Dark Heresy. However, if you are using the optional rules described under First Aid, the type of injury can affect the Medicae Test to treat patients. Use the predominant Damage type to determine the base Difficulty (e.g. the type of Damage that affects the target the most). In the case of two equal Damage types, use the worst modifier. Next, for each Damage type that afflicts the target beyond the first, reduce the Difficulty by one-step. This determines the base Difficulty of the Test. Unlike the system described in Dark Heresy, you must Test separately for each patient.

| Type      | Difficulty       |
|-----------|------------------|
| Energy    | Challenging (+0) |
| Explosive | Difficult (–10)  |
| Impact    | Challenging (+0) |
| Rending   | Difficult (–10)  |

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Example**

*Doctor Phelps attends four patients. His Intelligence Bonus is 3, so he takes a –10 penalty to his Medicae Tests to treat these patients from the start. Two patients have Energy Damage, so his Tests to provide extended care are at the base –10 penalty. One patient has Explosive Damage, so Doctor Phelps must succeed on a Hard (–20) Medicae Test to provide extended care to this poor soul. The worst-off patient took Energy, Impact and Rending Damage, the most of which was Rending. He's at –10 to start, –10 for Rending, and –20 for two additional Damage types for a total of –40. It doesn't look good for this soldier.*

#### **Pharmacy**

When administering a drug or treating a poison with Chem-Use, you may first make a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to bring to bear your Medicae knowledge. On a success, you gain a +5 bonus to the Chem-Use Test. On a failure by three or more degrees you take a –5 penalty instead.

#### **Navigation (Advanced) Intelligence**

#### **Skill Group:** Surface, Stellar

Whether using a simple map and archeocompass, an innate knowledge of the landscape or the stars themselves, an Acolyte with the Navigation skill is rarely lost.

#### **Throwing off Pursuers**

Knowledge of the landscape coupled with careful planning allows you to plot a route designed to lose any pursuers. You may make a Navigation Test to assist a Tracking or Concealment Test made to lose a pursuer.

#### **Tracking in Space**

By using stellar cartography, calculating ship velocity and headings, and analysing recent disturbances, you can attempt to track the movements of a spacecraft. You may make a Difficult (–10) Navigation (Stellar) Test to track a spacecraft in the same way you would use the Tracking skill to track a creature over land.

#### **Performer (Advanced) Fellowship**

**Skill Group:** Dancer, Musician, Singer and Storyteller. Others may be available with the GMs discretion.

As useful as the Performer skill is to entertaining fellow Acolytes on lengthy space voyages, it is perhaps more useful in distracting opponents or providing a useful cover story when undercover.

#### **Innuendo**

You may convey secret messages in your stories and songs. You may make a Difficult (–10) Performer (Singer or Storyteller) Test instead of a Cipher or Secret Tongue Test. The recipient of the message must have the correct Skill to comprehend the meaning as normal.

#### **Pilot (Advanced, Operator) Agility**

**Skill Group:** Civilian Craft, Military Craft and Spacecraft.

Whether snaking a lander through a hail of lasfire, or expertly piloting a guncutter in pursuit of a renegade ship, a skilled pilot is a vital component of nearly every Inquisitor's retinue.

#### **Shake Down**

A popular manoeuvre for when a ship has unwelcome intruders onboard is for the pilot to jolt or jar the craft in such a way as to force all unsecured passengers to lose their footing. If the defenders can be forewarned somehow, this can give them an advantage in a fight. You make a Pilot Test, opposed by an Agility Test by everyone caught unawares. If successful, the hapless victim is knocked over and must spend his next Round getting up again.

#### **Shadowing in a Vehicle**

You may make a Difficult (–10) Drive or Pilot Test instead of a Shadowing Test when following another creature or vehicle in your own vehicle. Success does not necessarily mean your vehicle goes unnoticed, but it does mean that it appears inconspicuous.

#### **Psyniscience (Advanced) Perception**

The Psyniscience skill is to psykers what Awareness is to mundane Acolytes. It allows them to detect nearby psychic disturbances and such forewarning allows them to avoid being surprised by a Daemon or psyker.

#### **Detailed Disruption**

Instead of merely detecting the number of locations or individuals causing a disruption in the immaterium, you may focus your senses to glean a little more information about them as follows. You may split your degrees of success between this chart and the chart on page 105 of Dark Heresy.

#### **Degrees Result of Success**

One The general strength of the phenomena (more or less powerful than you). Two or more The precise strength, nature and origin of the phenomena.

#### **Example**

*Herodi suspects that there is a psyker nearby, so he makes a Psyniscience Test to attempt to detect him. He gets two degrees of success, so could either detect the exact location of the psyker or the precise strength of the psyker. Or, he could split his degrees of success between the two charts, discerning the general location and the general strength of the psyker.*

#### **Diminish Psychic Attack**

Psyniscience allows you to perceive the intricate weaves of power involved in the manifestation of a Psychic Power. Whenever you are the target of a Psychic Power, you may make a Very Hard (–30) Psyniscience Test. If you succeed, you negate the effects of any of the power's Overbleed.

#### **Sense Lifeforms**

Every living creature leaves a psychic signature in the warp, and careful use of Psyniscience can allow you to detect the presence or absence of normal creatures. You may make a Difficult (–10) Psyniscience Test in place of an Awareness Test.

#### <span id="page-236-0"></span>**Scholastic Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Archaic, Astromancy, Beasts, Bureaucracy, Chymistry, Cryptology, Heraldry, Imperial Creed, Judgement, Legend, Numerology, Occult, Philosophy and Tactica Imperialis.

Many Acolytes spend a great deal of their life studying and researching, becoming experts in their field, from psykers with their knowledge of the occult and the warp, arbitrators with their fanatical knowledge of Imperial justice, and officers with their understanding of the minutiae of the Tactica Imperialis. It is precisely for this expertise that Inquisitors surround themselves with such adept Acolytes.

#### **Practical Knowledge**

Whilst Scholastic Lore mainly concerns the theoretical, quite often it is applicable to more practical pursuits. You may make a Scholastic Lore Test to gain a +10 bonus to a related Skill Test, or to assist another Acolyte using a related Skill. However, doing so greatly increases the time taken to carry out the Skill Test as no scholarly knowledge is recalled hurriedly. The related Skill Test increases in time from Rounds to minutes, minutes to hours and hours to days. If the time taken is already in days, then this is increased by a further 1d10 days.

| Scholastic Lore    | Related Skill     |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Astromancy         | Navigation        |
| Beasts             | Survival          |
|                    | & Wrangling       |
| Chymistry          | Chem-Use          |
| Cryptology         | Cipher            |
| Imperial Creed     | Invocation        |
| Judgement          | Intimidate        |
|                    | & Interrogate     |
| Numerology         | Barter, Evaluate, |
|                    | & Logic           |
| Occult             | Invocation        |
| Tactica Imperialis | Command           |
|                    |                   |

#### **Scrutiny (Basic) Perception**

Whilst some would argue that an Inquisitor's default frame of mind is to be suspicious, those Acolytes with the Scrutiny skill are better able to judge when a suspect genuinely warrants that suspicion.

#### **Empathy**

A successful Scrutiny Test allows you to discern a target's disposition. This Test is Opposed by the target's Deceive Test if he has something to hide.

#### **Lying**

You may use your knowledge of lying to help make your own lies all the more difficult to detect. If you first make a successful Scrutiny Test you gain a +10 bonus to a subsequent Deceive Test.

#### **Search (Basic) Perception**

Search is a useful Skill for Acolytes conducting investigations, helping turn up valuable clues or hidden evidence. Search differs from Awareness in that it involves a great deal of exploration, turning over items, opening doors and letting your instincts guide you as you toss a room.

#### **Lengthy Searches**

You may opt to take longer over a search, meticulously going over every square metre to find what you are looking for. For every additional five minutes you spend searching an area, you gain a +10 bonus on your Search Test (to a maximum of +30).

#### **Searching for Clues**

Search cannot be used as an Investigation Skill in its own right, but it can be used to assist an Investigation Skill. When investigating a crime scene, you may make a Search Test to attempt to notice any clues. Every degree of success reduces the Difficulty of a subsequent Investigation Test by one-step.

#### **Secret Tongue (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Gutter, Military and Tech. Other Secret Languages may be available at the GMs discretion.

Just as with a cipher, many Acolytes use of Secret Tongues to quickly and discretely convey messages between one another. An Inquisitorial team who all know the same tongue are able to speak freely during battle or in other open situations without fear of being overheard or understood.

#### **Ciphers**

Although much of the meaning of a secret tongue requires body language and verbal intonations, it can be conveyed as part of a crude cipher. You may make a Difficult (–10) Secret Tongue Test instead of a Cipher Test.

Alternatively, if you first make a Secret Tongue Test you gain +10 to a subsequent related Cipher Test, representing the multiple layers of meaning and code hidden within the message.

#### **Security (Advanced) Agility**

Many an Acolyte has saved himself the indignity of breaking down a door with judicious use of the Security skill. Security is used to bypass locks of all types and circumvent tough security systems to get into well-protected locations. You can also use Security to take control of security systems so they work for you instead of the original owner.

#### **Hiding from Sensors**

Sometimes it won't be a person looking for you, but a sensor, such as an auspex. Unless the sensor relies on physical input, the Concealment skill is of no use. Instead you may use the Security skill in place of Concealment, if you have the means to disrupt or deceive the sensor.

#### **Security Rigging**

You can make a Security Test to set up and install a security system. Each degree of success increases the difficulty of any Test made to breach it by one. A Security Test to setup a security device takes one hour.

#### **Security Surveillance**

When using handheld scanners or larger security monitors, you may use Security instead of Awareness.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Shadowing (Advanced) Agility**

Whether stalking a dangerous heretic through a packed market or following a contact through the deserted streets of a spaceport, Shadowing is useful for avoiding getting spotted. Shadowing differs from Concealment in that the latter involves hunkering down and hiding in one place, while the former is all about skulking and sneaking, creeping along while staying out of sight from your prey.

Shadowing becomes far easier in certain environments. When threading through a dense crowd, or following along in a foggy night, you gain a bonus on your Test. Each factor that masks your presence confers a +10 bonus to a maximum of +30 for three factors. For example, you would get a +20 bonus when Shadowing a target at night through a crowded bazaar.

#### **Evade Pursuit**

Once you are aware that you're being followed, you can use Shadowing to evade pursuit. Make a Shadowing Test Opposed by your opponent's Awareness Test. If you beat your opponent a number of times equal to his Intelligence Bonus, you manage to slip away unseen.

#### **Silent Move (Basic) Agility**

The Inquisition carries out much of its work in the shadows, going about its investigations under the noses of the heretical and dangerous. An Acolyte who has the ability to move about unnoticed, entering suspects' houses without them realising, is a highly useful asset.

#### **Ambush**

You can attempt to sneak up on your opponent and ambush him. So long as you are not in combat and have not yet been noticed, you may make a Silent Move Test Opposed by your opponent's Awareness Test. If you are successful, you sneak up on your opponent as though you had successfully Feinted in combat, and so long as your next Action is a Standard Attack, it cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a Standard Attack then this advantage is lost.

#### **Sneak**

You can make yourself practically invisible when Shadowing an opponent. If you first succeed with a Silent Move Test, you gain a +10 bonus on your Shadowing Test.

#### **Sleight of Hand (Advanced) Agility**

Although derided as common street subterfuge, Sleight of Hand has many practical applications for the Acolyte, ranging from the ability to palm a small but useful object at a crime scene, to slipping your Inquisitorial rosette away when apprehended by heretics, or even pulling a pistol from a concealed holster unseen by your enemies.

#### **Distraction**

You may make a Sleight of Hand Test to dazzle audiences with tricks of the hand with cards, marbles, or whatever other prop you happen to have. Any allies nearby who can take advantage of the distraction may benefit from your successful Test as if you were assisting them.

#### **Speak Language (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** High Gothic, Hive Dialect, Low Gothic, Ship Dialect and Tribal Dialect. Other languages may be available at the GMs discretion.

Knowledge of a variety of languages can broaden your ability to deal with the indigenous peoples of the worlds you explore, allowing you to communicate easily without having to resort to pantomime.

#### **Understanding Similar Languages**

Even if you are not familiar with a particular language or dialect, you may make a Hard (–20) Speak Language Test to attempt to understand a sense of the meaning or intent. If you speak a related language or dialect (such as High Gothic to Low Gothic, Hive Dialect to Low Gothic, and so on) the Difficulty decreases to Difficult (–10).

#### **Crude Ciphers**

You can make a Speak Language Test to improvise a crude cipher, a sort of pidgin tongue intended to convey a coded message. If successful, you manage to make a message that makes sense and a Speak Language Test, or an Easy (+10) Logic or Scholastic Lore (Crypography) translates it.

#### **Survival (Advanced) Intelligence**

Whether lying in wait for Nurgle cultists in the foetid jungle of a death world or searching for shelter from a sandstorm on a desert planet, the Survival skill can be a lifesaver.

#### **Hunting**

You may use the Survival skill in place of Tracking when hunting for animals in the wild. The Difficulty, however, worsens by one-step. It may not be used in urban areas or to track human or alien prey.

#### **Snares**

You can use the Survival skill to construct simple snares and traps to catch animals and other prey. To set the trap, you must succeed on Survival Test. The base Difficulty is Ordinary (+0), but you may increase the Difficulty in order to make it harder to disable or escape the snare.

A typical snare triggers by location, meaning that the target steps into the area and is affected by the trap. Snares affect just one target at a time and can be made large enough to ensnare a mansized creature. Once sprung, the trap must be manually reset to work again.

An intelligent creature may notice the trap before springing it by succeeding on an Awareness or Search Test. The Difficulty of this Test is Routine (+20), but if you also succeed on a Concealment Test, you can increase the Difficulty by one-step plus one-step for each degree of success. You may not retry the Concealment Test when constructing the snare.

If the target locates the snare, it can either go around it or attempt to neutralise it. In the case of the latter, the target must succeed on a Survival Test against the same Difficulty made to set the snare. On a success, the snare is dismantled.

Should the target spring the trap, it may make an Agility Test against the same Difficulty you faced to set the trap. On a success, the creature avoids the snare. On a failure, it is firmly caught and held until released. A caught creature can attempt a Contortionist Test once each hour to escape. Again, the Difficulty is the same as the one you beat to set the snare in the first place.

#### **Swim (Basic, Movement) Strength**

Opportunities for swimming in the 41st Millennium are often rare, but on occasion, this is a useful Skill to have, especially when exploring water worlds, tramping through sewers or escaping a wreck that landed in a large body of water.

#### **Aquatic Combat**

Whenever you fight while submerged in water, all Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests take a –20 penalty. As well, you must succeed on a Swim Test to move in this environment. When you Test your Swim skill, and you get two or more degrees of success, you reduce the Difficulty of your attack Tests to Difficult (–10).

#### **Hiding Underwater**

You can hide from a pursuer on land by diving into a body of water and waiting below the surface until they have passed by. If you do this you may use your Swim skill instead of Concealment.

#### **Life-Saving**

When another character gets into trouble in the water, you can dive in to help him out. If you reach the struggling character, you can pull him to safety by succeeding on a Swim Test, but the Difficulty worsens by one-step for the added bulk.

#### **Tech-Use (Advanced) Intelligence**

Gear and equipment in the 41st Millennium is tricky to use, the machinespirits unruly and restless. Tech-Use allows you to placate these entities and make them more cooperative when working with devices of all kinds.

#### **Cyber Wrangling**

You may use your Tech-Use instead of Wrangling, but only when dealing with machines designed to look and act like beasts, such as a cyber-mastiff.

#### **Technical Support**

When another character's Skill Test involves a piece of equipment, you may assist them using your Tech-Use skill, even if they are using a different Skill.

#### **Example**

*Mattheus struggles with the controls of the Inquisitor's guncutter during a rough landing and must make a Pilot Test. Ruthe does not have the Pilot skill so cannot normally assist, but because he is in the engine room placating the machine-spirit of the ship, he may assist using his Tech-Use skill instead.*

#### **Tracking (Advanced) Intelligence**

Tracking can be a handy skill to have in a wide variety of situations, whether chasing an escaped cultist through the sewers, working out the number of intruders at a crime scene, or hunting a wild beast in the wilderness.

#### **Escaping Pursuit**

Whilst the most straightforward way of concealing tracks from a pursuer is to hide them using the Concealment skill, as a skilled tracker, you have several more tricks up his sleeve, such as backtracking by using your own tracks or disguising your tracks to resemble those of an animal. You can make a Tracking Test to conceal your tracks instead of Concealment.

#### **Tracking Suspects**

You may use the Tracking skill as an Investigation Skill in situations where it is important to work out who or what has been present at a site, when they were there and how many were there, as well as working out where they went next.

#### **Trade (Advanced, Crafting) Various**

**Skill Group:** Agri (S), Apothecary (Int), Armourer (S), Artist (Ag), Cartographer (Ag), Cook (Int), Copyist (Int), Embalmer (Int), Mason (Ag), Merchant (Fel), Miner (S), Prospector (S), Scrimshawer (Ag), Smith (S), Soothsayer (Fel) Tanner (S), Technomat (Int), Valet (Fel) and Wright (Int). Others may be available at the GMs discretion.

Many Acolytes possess exceptional skills, either acquired before their service to the Inquisition or picked up during their employment. Of these, Trade skills are some of the most fascinating. If they possess the appropriate Skill, they can create unique gear and equipment, anything from a customised speeder to an illuminated manuscript, as well as countless other items far more interesting than a simple entry from the equipment lists. After all, would your players prefer to have infra-red goggles or enhanced "phaeton-pattern multi-goggles" that combine the abilities of the basic item plus that of a photo-visor? While the answer should be obvious, these items have a price in labour and cost, even to the trained tech-priest.

Trade Skills do far more than allow for simple Skill Tests; they represent the skill set necessary to modify or create things. If an Acolyte wants an armoured body glove, a longrange vox-caster or a two-handed shock mace, he needs the appropriate Trade Skill, or the Thrones to pay someone who does. Players use the Crafting rules found later in this chapter to create these kinds of items. Possession of these Skills also grants other advantages.

An Acolyte with Trade skills is considered a member of the Trading Class for purposes of determining monthly income (Table 124: Income and Social Class in Dark Heresy). This status may allow for interaction with citizens of a social status far beyond—or below—their means, along with the gratitude or ill-will that goes along with it! Cunning GMs can use these Skills as springboards for entire campaigns or as short, one-off adventures.

#### **Trade (Agri) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

While the odds of your Acolyte settling down to become an agriworker is not high, there may be instances where this Skill comes into play during the campaign, whether to start an ornamental garden in your quarters as a hobby or to cultivate a rare xenos flower essential to the treatment of an uncommon disease. This Skill can also be used for the identification and classification of unknown plants.

When using this Skill to grow a crop, be it medicinal, ornamental or foodstuff, the end Craftsmanship of the task determines the quality of the harvest.

**Poor:** The plant yields only half of the expected result, or the potency is only half that foreseen.

**Common:** The growth of the plants is average or as anticipated.

**Good:** Careful tending has produced plants with 150% of the results of a normal crop, either in quantity or influence.

**Best:** Attentive cultivation results in plants with twice the properties or yield of the standard variety.

#### **Trade (Apothecary) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

As a capable apothecary, you can do far more than just hand out anti-tox pills. You can develop new compounds from medicinal plants or chemicals and warn against the dangerous side effects of drug combinations. Your skills enable you to oversee the longterm reactions resultant from the most beneficial or destructive substances in the Imperium. You can recreate substances when provided a small sample and the proper equipment, and can determine new uses for existing substances by combining them in new ways. For example, you may be able to determine that combining spook and obscura in certain proportions actually creates a mind-warping hallucinogen—or a deadly poison.

While the Chem-Use skill covers the typical use and simple manufacture of toxins, poisons and drugs, the Trade (Apothecary) skill allows you to formulate more advanced compounds, identify particularly complex mixtures and anticipate the interaction between different medicines or toxins, particularly ones requiring substantial time to develop.

This Skill can also be used to recall the origin, derivation or manufacture of even complex or obscure substances, such as remembering that the primary ingredient of Slaught can be created from glands found in soldier-hornets. The result of the roll determines the amount of information revealed according to Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore.

Of course, you must first obtain all the necessary ingredients, components and equipment before attempting to create a compound. Acquiring the proper substances for specialised or restricted formulae may be quite difficult or illegal, or form the basis of an entire adventure.

The creation of complex compounds utilise the Crafting rules described on [page 245.](#page-245-0) Research into the nature or interaction of an unknown substance follows the Using Investigation Skills section on page 186 of Dark Heresy.

#### <span id="page-240-0"></span>**Trade (Armourer) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

The Trade (Armourer) skill is used to create, modify or repair arms and armour, from simple tasks such as adding a fire selector to a bolt pistol to the complex design of combi-weapons and artificer armour. This Skill deals with personal weapons and protection rather than vehicular or large-scale systems, which are covered by the Trade (Wright) skill.

One of the most commonly used Skills and potentially most useful in everyday application, Trade (Armourer) grants you unparalleled creativity in customising your kit. Keep in mind, however, that some technologies are simply beyond the capabilities of all but the most learned of the Adeptus Mechanicus. No Acolyte, however skilled, can create or repair weaponry from the Age of Technology. The GM should be the final judge in such matters.

You will still find a bewildering number of possibilities available for the alteration and upgrading of weapons and armour, from creating adamantine blades (without the Primitive attribute) to customising armour for its wearer (giving it Good Craftsmanship). Simple upgrades, such as those found in Chapter V: Armoury of Dark Heresy only require a simple Skill Test, but the creation of a more elaborate modification of armaments uses the Crafting rules. While by no means an exhaustive list, Table 9-4: Armourer Test Difficulty serves as a guideline for determining Crafting Difficulty.

In addition, you may use this Skill to identify the forge world, manufacturer, or possibly even the artisan who created the device, depending on the degrees of success on the Skill Test. If you have found a weapon used to murder a local Imperial official, it may be useful to know that it is Stygies VII-Pattern and engraved by the renowned master armourer Weland Tudela. Use Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore for identification.

# **Trade (Artist) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility (Intelligence)**

An artist can produce objects or experiences of profound beauty or emotion, inspiring the senses, mind and spirit. The Performer Skill Group covers the execution of many art forms dance, recital or storytelling—but Trade (Artist) deals with the creation of the material performed— the poem, play or song. The Skill also covers the composition of physical art: sculpture, paintings and hololiths.

Agility is the default characteristic for the Trade (artist) skill, but GMs may optionally allow the player to use Intelligence for the creation of more scholarly works, such as plays, music, poems and novels.

This Skill also gives the Acolyte the ability to observe works of art and potentially recall information about the school or style of the piece, and possibly even the name of the artist.

The Craftsmanship of a piece of art can make its performance easier or harder. A play or poem of Poor Craftsmanship would impose a –10 penalty to its performance. A song of Good Craftsmanship would impart a +10 bonus to the Test of the performer, and a tale of Best Craftsmanship grants a +20 bonus to its presentation. These bonuses also apply to the Charming Performance and Enthralling Performance rules.

**Inspirational Art:** Art can affect the mood of those observing it in many ways, including inspiration, sadness, anger and others. If the artist wants his work to affect the audience in a particular way, this should be defined in Step One: Defining the Task of the Crafting rules. The GM assigns a different Difficulty to creating a mural that inspires a positive reaction to the Adeptus Mechanicus than one without additional effects. Keep in mind, however, that these are moderate effects. While the viewer may feel inspired by the art, it will not cause him to change or act against firmly held beliefs.

The creation of an inspirational art piece is Hard (–20) for concepts coinciding with local culture, such as veneration of the Emperor within the Imperium, but is Very Hard (–30) for anything going against such conventions, such as fostering a more positive reaction to xenos when viewed in the Imperium.

## **Trade (Cartographer) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility**

You can produce maps and charts of high quality from information gathered first hand or by others. The Craftsmanship of these documents can affect the Navigation Tests of those using them. Likewise, you are able to read maps made by others more easily, obtaining hidden or obscure information left by other cartographers.

The cartographer must use observation or research to gain adequate information to create a map. The GM should keep this in mind when assigning the duration of a task, as large maps require lengthy examination and groundwork. The Heightened Senses (Vision) Talent can reduce the Difficulty of the task by one level if gathering data personally, so the Difficulty of creating a map of a labyrinthine Ecclesiarchy cathedral would be reduced from Difficult (–10) to Challenging (+0).

| Table 9-4: Armourer Test Difficulty               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

When creating maps from research, existing sources or second-hand information, the final Craftsmanship of the map can be no greater than that of the source material, no matter how good your rolls during the Crafting process.

#### **Trade (Cook) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

An Acolyte with this Skill can create meals not only pleasing to the palate, but also ones of desired nutritional content—or lack thereof. The results of this Skill can also be combined with Carouse, Chem-Use or Trade (Apothecary) in making drinks or medicines that taste better, or the creation of foods that mask certain flavours from those ingesting them. The GM should set the Difficulty of the task in accordance with the traits desired. Creating a simple but nutritious meal for fellow Acolytes might be Ordinary (+10); cooking a dish to mask a bland-tasting drug for a noble's entourage would be Difficult (–10); or devising a meal nutritious for a xenos creature could be Very Hard (–30).

Acolytes can also use this Skill to determine the ingredients or origins of foods they consume, or notice out of the ordinary tastes, using Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore. They can also make an Opposed Skill Test against the subject's Perception to either hide or reveal hidden substances within a dish or drink.

Meals or drinks of exceptional quality can affect Blather or Charm Tests. Refreshments of Poor Craftsmanship result in a penalty of –10 to these Tests, but a banquet of Good quality gives a +10 bonus and those of Best Craftsmanship grant a +20 bonus.

#### **Trade (Copyist) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

Copyists in the 41st Millennium are far more than mindless scribes scratching out data sheets with an electro-quill. Though certainly capable of this task, an Acolyte with the Copyist skill creates illuminated manuscripts of great beauty, containing anything from family histories to epic ballads.

In addition to penning words, copyists can create ink and other writing implements, including pigments that can only be read in certain types of light, ones that disappear after a specific period of time, or types capable of marking or etching pages of metal, ceramic or hide. Pigments of this variety allow for very advanced codes and provide a +10 bonus to Cipher Tests when using written materials. Each Trade (Copyist) Skill Mastery confers an additional bonus equal to the level of mastery.

Copyists can also create paper—as well as other writing mediums—and bindings. Pages can consist of sources as exotic as woven metal or alien animal hide, but could also be as simple as compressed plant fibre.

#### **Trade (Embalmer) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

An Acolyte with the Trade (Embalmer) skill can preserve the deceased, as well as almost any organic material, animal or plant, though some things require more elaborate treatments and chemicals than others. This Skill also allows you to reconstruct recently dead plants, animals or persons into a semblance of their unblemished living appearance. The process often requires chemicals and fluids with noxious odours, resulting in a somewhat negative public opinion of the trade.

In extreme cases, the reconstructive aspect of this Skill allows insight into the appearance of living things from even partial, damaged, decomposed or even skeletal remains. The Difficulty for the Test depends upon its condition. When used in this manner, utilise the Using Investigation Skills section on page 186 of Dark Heresy. The degrees of success determine the information deduced about the living creature or plant according to the following table:

| Degrees<br>of Success    | Information Gained                                               |  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Standard success         | Basic or unconfirmed<br>information concerning<br>the subject.   |  |
| One degree               | Complete<br>general<br>knowledge on the topic.                   |  |
| Two degrees              | Broad knowledge on<br>the matter, with some<br>specific details. |  |
| Three degrees<br>or more | Complete<br>detailed<br>information.                             |  |

#### **Trade (Mason) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility**

Masons erect structures, monuments, walls and fortifications out of stone blocks, mortar or cement. Depending on the desired result, materials may include cobblestone, granite, ouslite, marble or any of a number of materials. This Skill also covers the use of rockcrete, a common building material for Imperial structures and fortifications where speed of construction outweighs artistic concerns, and various reinforcements to stonework with iron or plasteel.

Given the scale of most masonry projects and the gross weight of the materials involved, most Acolytes will wish to use the Cooperation rules or at the very least some strong-backed servitors. With the hectic pace of Inquisitorial work, it's unlikely that circumstance will allow them time to personally fit each piece of stone for a project. Labour or servitors that simply move blocks of stone rather than practicing the skilled aspects of this trade do not count against the Cooperation rules.

#### **Trade (Merchant) (Advanced, Crafting, Interaction) Fellowship**

While the Barter skill covers immediate, short-term negotiations, the Trade (Merchant) skill represents the strategic manoeuvring and long-term dialogues necessary not only to close the deal but also to bring the other party to the table in the first place. Thus, you use Barter when haggling over the price of a data-slate, but use Trade (Merchant) when negotiating the rights to a stellar trade route between Landunder and the Lathes, or exclusive import rights to Hecuter firearms. These are discussions that may take months as opposed to minutes, and acts as a prolonged Interaction skill.

Various other Interaction Skills may have effects on the results of the negotiations: Blather, Charm, Deceive and Intimidate. The GM may have the characters roleplay specific meetings of the negotiations, for which he may grant a one-off bonus or penalty of +/–10 to the Test for that time interval as detailed in Step 4: Test Roles of the Crafting Rules. Alternately, he may allow the players to make an appropriate Interaction Skill Test for a similar modifier if they do not wish to roleplay the situation.

### **Trade (Miner) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

You are skilled in extracting stone, ore, gems or even promethium from the ground using a variety of methods, from drills and shovels to pumps and pipes. This Trade concentrates on removing the resource from the ground, as opposed to Trade (Prospector), which focuses on the detection or discovery of these valuable materials. Mineral wealth is not the only valuable commodity found under the ground; this Skill is also useful for the recovery of artefacts and antiquities when used with the proper care. You may also use this Skill to construct subsurface works suitable for eventual expansion into habitation or fortification. A mason or wright constructing an underground structure gains a +10 bonus on Crafting Tests if assisted by someone with the Trade (Miner) skill. Likewise, a miner gains a +10 bonus on Crafting Tests if assisted by someone with the Demolition skill, assuming they're digging for something neither fragile nor flammable!

Given the scale of most excavations, most miners have a workforce of some size to provide the brute force to move excavated dirt and stone out of the dig. These workers do not count as Cooperation, but simply allow for the miner to concentrate on technical aspects of the dig.

You gain a +10 bonus on Navigation (Surface) rolls when inside large or underground structures, such as the underhive or tunnels.

#### **Trade (Prospector) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

Acolytes with the Trade (Prospector) skill can survey an area to determine if it contains potentially valuable resources. Note that they will only be able to determine if those materials might be present and not their exact quantity, nor will they discover things far removed from the subject of their search.

When the Acolyte and GM look at Step One: Define the Task of the Crafting rules, they should carefully delineate the search, ensuring it is not too broad in scope. Thus, searching ten square kilometres for evidence of underground Promethium is perfectly acceptable, while prospecting "the plains" for "any valuable ores" would only be satisfactory if the Acolyte were armed with extensive testing apparatus and an army of assistants. Simply searching for "any resource" is right out.

However, because the search for one material may very well give evidence of another, additional degrees of success may provide additional discoveries. Keep in mind Acolytes receive this additional information regardless of the existence of the material for which they originally searched.

#### **Degrees Information Gained of Success**

Standard No additional information. Success

One If present at the location, Degree the Acolyte discovers evidence

of related resources, though not their exact nature. For example, a search for platinum ore would reveal the existence of another valuable ore in the area, but not its type.

Two The Acolyte finds one other Degrees material related to the search or incomplete information on one find only partially related to it. Thus, prospecting for industrial crystal formations might reveal evidence of emeralds or the possible existence of promethium pockets.

Three In addition to the results of or more the original search, the Acolyte Degrees discovers facts about another resource in the area. So, for example, while positively verifying that an area contains no water, the Acolyte also discovers sounding echoes from a system of oddly regular subterranean caverns.

#### **Trade (Scrimshawer) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility**

You have the ability to inscribe artwork and text onto ivory, bone and similar substances. Typically done with a needle and ink, much in the same way as a tattoo, hunters have often created artwork on the bones of their trophies. However, this ability has broader applications, allowing you to permanently mark many other materials utilising inks or acids suitable to each medium. It is rumoured that a few zealous Chapters of the mighty Space Marines practise this art upon their own living bones to memorialise fallen comrades.

At its most basic level, you use this Skill to determine if a material is suitable for scrimshaw, and to identify the proper "ink" for the process. Some only practise this art upon a hunting trophy, and some search for years to find a specific material for their work. As with the Trade (Apothecary) skill, the search for rare ivories or ingredients for inks can form entire adventures of their own.

This Skill interacts with a number of the other Crafting Skills: Trade (Apothecary) could assist in the creation of unique inks; Trade (Artist) might allow you to create a work of great beauty; Trade (Cartographer) may give assistance in engraving a map; Trade (Embalmer) can allow you to preserve your works from the ravages of time and decay. The GM should allow an appropriate bonus for creative Skill combinations.

#### **Trade (Smith) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

A character with the Trade (Smith) skill can shape or reshape metal, smelt alloys from ingots or ore, and forge all manners of weapons, tools and armour. Unlike some Trade skills, a smith requires a potentially extensive workshop, to include a heat source (forge), hammer block (anvil) and hammer, which may be powered by the smith's arm or a machine. While a metalsmith working in gold or platinum might have a closet-sized

workshop and miniature tools, the power hammers required for largescale projects—or harder metals such as adamantium—can weigh upwards of 100 tonnes. Forges can vary in size from that of a ration box to the legendary Titan-works on Mars.

Suitably equipped, and using more advanced alloys than iron or steel, an Acolyte can create armours and blades without the Primitive quality as a Difficult (–10) Crafting task.

Smiths often work alongside those with the Trade (Armourer) or Trade (Wright) skill to create special items or armour. For example, while a smith could certainly create a suit of feral plate armour, in conjunction with an armourer he might integrate less primitive elements. Likewise, alongside a wright, he can build structural components or armoured plate for vehicles or fortifications.

Acolytes with the Trade (Smith) skill can also recognise the work of other masters in the field, using Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore as a guide.

## **Trade (Soothsayer) (Advanced, Crafting) Fellowship**

It is important to distinguish the Trade (Soothsayer) skill, which gives the appearance of telling the future, from psykers using warp-powered divination. Certain "gifted" fortune tellers combine these Skills, but generally speaking, psychology and intuition power this Skill rather than the warp. Soothsayers are observant and perceptive individuals, adept at piecing together minute elements of information about an individual and spinning a tale of the future tailored to what their mark wants to hear. They use many of the same trappings as true psykers, including the Emperor's Tarot and fetishes, but these trapping are without any real power besides a keen intellect.

Trade (Soothsayer) works much in the same way as the Charm skill, influencing future actions of the individual whose fortune is being told. However, it acts over longer periods of time and allows for changes in the subject's planned actions in addition to their opinions.

A successful Skill Test convinces the subject of the authenticity of the soothsayer's skills. After this, the player and GM should discuss the time frame and desired outcome of the fortunetelling sessions using the Crafting rules on [page 245.](#page-245-0)

#### **Trade (Tanner) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

An Acolyte with the Trade (Tanner) skill treats animal hides to create supple, durable leathers used for clothing, armour or equipment. From semi-rigid armour cured from carnodon hide to soft and durable boots stitched from b'llek skin to a cape made from a crotalid pelt, tanners can fabricate all manner of equipment with their trade. Use of this Skill also encompasses the long-term care of leathers to prevent decay, cracking and other adverse effects of age.

Different animal hides necessitate different tanning methods, in both method and duration of the process. Generally, the more thick, tough or durable the skin, the more steps are necessary for treatment. Tanners require suitable chemicals for each step of the process, which due to their noxious smell often banish the trade to

the outskirts—or underhive—of many cities. This may make them unpopular with their fellow Acolytes if operating out of cramped quarters.

You can also use this Skill to determine the animal from which a particular leather was manufactured, using Table 9-3: Trade Skills Lore.

#### **Trade (Technomat) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

The Trade (Technomat) skill differs from most of the other Trade Skills in that it represents the care and maintenance of items rather than their creation. However, as the mysteries of creation for many items from the Golden Age of Technology have been forever lost, this Skill has great value throughout the Imperium.

Because of this technological regression, technomats may have no actual knowledge of why their maintenance rituals are effective, but simply know that they are. The application of holy oils and unguents, ritual sequences involving chants and prayers, or contact with certain runes on these sacred devices has placated their machine-spirits and kept them functional for generations. Knowledge of these rites is all that is required, not understanding of their underlying purpose.

The Skill may also be used to create effective rituals for newly discovered items, based upon the vast knowledge of customs for similar devices. Thus, if the Acolytes discover an ancient cogitator, their technomat might attempt to placate its machine-spirit with rituals known for similar machines.

#### **Trade (Valet) (Advanced, Crafting) Fellowship**

You have the ability to shrewdly provide for the needs of another for a range of requirements, including administrative and personal needs, and can even supervise a staff administering to these needs on a larger scale. Individuals with this Skill often use the title "major domo" or "chief of staff ".

At the most trivial level, this Skill addresses immediate concerns, such as selection of appropriate apparel for a meeting with an Imperial Governor or picking a suitable refreshment for a Clan Lord of Tallarn. Successful use of this Skill grants a +10 bonus on a single Interaction Skill Test for either the valet or host, representing the favourable impression generated by these thoughtful touches.

It may not be immediately apparent how to reconcile this Skill with the Crafting rules, but there are a number of Extended Tests that qualify:

• Maintaining a schedule of appointments and duties for a lengthy period of time.

• Assembling a proper wardrobe for a specific culture or Imperial region.

• Making arrangements for a large conclave of Inquisitorial representatives.

For these long-term Tests, the resultant Craftsmanship may impart certain bonuses at the GMs discretion.

#### **Trade (Wright) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

Acolytes use the Trade (Wright) skill for large-scale design and construction Tests. Buildings, bridges, monuments, vehicles and even void-capable starcraft fall under this broad expertise. While this Skill grants you the ability to design structures and vehicular systems, an Acolyte will rarely have all the tools and equipment necessary to realise his designs without significant outside assistance. It's all well and good to design a 200 metre marble arch celebrating the victory of Imperial forces over the Overfiend of Octarius, but quite another to actually build it!

Acolytes use the Crafting rules to formulate their design, determining appropriate modifiers for scale and complexity. After completion of the design, the construction is a separate Crafting task, using the appropriate Trade Skills, such as Trade (Mason) for a bunker or Trade (Smith) for armour plating on a battle bike. Wrights must usually enlist the help of others to realise their plans. Many masons, smiths and artists must all join skills to raise your Imperial victory arch.

For large or complex jobs, you may wish to utilise the Cooperation rules or split a job into smaller sub-tasks using the Dividing Tasks section to reduce the overall time necessary for completion. It might take one Wright a decade to design an entire hive city hab-unit, but he might complete the plans for the superstructure in a fraction of that time while others focus on different portions of the project.

You may also use the Trade (Wright) skill to gain information about the constructs or fabrications of others, such as the STC design upon which a speeder was based or the school of design for a bridge. Use Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore as a guide to determine the information gained.

#### **Wrangling (Advanced) Intelligence**

Despite the technological advancements of the Imperium, many worlds still rely on beasts of burden to carry them about. An Acolyte who is as comfortable on a horse as he is on a bike will rarely be left without a mode of transport.

#### **Riding Animals**

Any animal that's been trained can be ridden without having to Test Wrangling. You simply climb onto the mount (a Half Action) and ride off into the "setting suns".

Should the animal be unfriendly (i.e. it has not been trained), odds are that if you manage to get into the saddle, you won't stay there for long. To calm such an animal so you can ride it, you must make a Wrangling Test with a Difficulty depending on the beast's Disposition (set by the GM and accounting for your appearance, the animal's mood and the circumstances of the encounter). On a successful Test, you may climb up and ride. On a failure, the beast objects and tries to throw you off, requiring a Difficult (–10) Agility Test. If you pass, you may attempt another Wrangling Test, otherwise you are thrown off (flying 1d5 metres in a random direction). To gain control over an uncontrolled beast, you must succeed on a number of Wrangling Tests equal to the mount's Willpower Bonus. If you fail any of the Tests by four or more degrees, the beast is untameable and will never allow you to ride it; you'll have to find another means of transport!

*"Your skills are a gift of the Omnissiah. Create nothing with your hands and mind that you do not believe to be useful, beautiful, or lethal."*

— Arch-Magos Morrius, Master Artificer.

There will come a time in every Acolyte's career when they will crave something unique, perhaps a compact bolter with devotional inlays of gold, or maybe a cloak cut from the hide of a vanquished beast. They might even wish to erect a shrine to honour a comrade fallen in the name of the Emperor. Acolytes with the proper Skills can design and create these things, and many more besides, with the appropriate Skills and tools. T Using Crafting Rules

Skills with the Crafting descriptor are resolved in a different way than most other Skills. You may not know the results of your efforts with only one throw of the dice, and possibly not for extended periods of game time. These are Extended Tests that accumulate results over the course of many Skill Tests, and may take days, weeks or months to complete rather than several Rounds.

# **Using Crafting Skills**

The creation of new items can be long, exhausting work. An agri-worker or sculptor alike may toil for months before their efforts come to fruition. Just the design of particularly complex items may take months, to say nothing of their construction. Yet in the end, a patient artisan may be rewarded with a unique item whose appearance, attributes or abilities far exceed those of lesser craftsmanship.

Similarly, you may wish to improve upon an item already in your possession, either by upgrading its functionality or improving its Craftsmanship.

The Acolyte begins the Crafting process by defining the item he wishes to create in defined game terms. The GM uses this information to assign a Difficulty, Duration and Cost to the task. Both the player and GM consider a variety of choices or circumstances that may adjust these assigned factors. Next, the Acolyte makes appropriate Skill Tests after completion of a certain duration of work, and make decisions about how to best use his successes. If all goes well, the Acolyte's labour will result in a prized item of first-rate workmanship.

#### **Step One: Define the Task**

There is an enormous difference between adding a fire selector to an autopistol and creating a custom powersword, or between cooking a quick meal for a group of hungry Acolytes and preparing a fine banquet worthy of Imperial nobles. You must very clearly define your goals in concrete game terms so the GM can accurately determine the Difficulty of creating the item. You should think about basic elements, such as the base item, additional or enhanced attributes and abilities, and even reduced performance in some cases. In addition, you should specify any statistics different from those of the base item: weight, special qualities, Armour Points, or anything else appropriate to the task.

It's the GMs responsibility to ensure that the player has adequately defined the task or item, including all game effects. Should either GM or player miss anything in this step, it is assumed to be the same as a basic item of Common Craftsmanship.

#### **Example**

*Gyth, a Guardsman with the Trade (Armourer) skill, has decided that she wants to integrate a Cameleoline coating into a set of Guard flak armour while her fellow Acolytes do research in a nearby Administratum archive. The flak armour uses all the standard statistics from the* Dark Heresy *core rulebook, and the coating will have exactly the same game effects as a cameleoline cloak. The GM agrees that this adequately defines the task in game terms and proceeds with the next step.*

#### **Step Two: Assign Difficulty, Duration and Cost**

Most citizens of the Imperium regard technology as mysterious and beyond the reach of any but the most devoted of the Cult Mechanicus. Craftsmen, however, bridge the gap between the mundane and mystical, allowing them to create items different or superior to the norm.

Even with these Skills, there are certain tasks that are simply impossible, such as creating a plasma gun out of primitive components or improving a power sword with crude tools. While it's easy for the GM to say "no" to a player's request, you may find that this eventually stifles their creativity. A better option might be to assign a very challenging Difficulty, Duration or Cost to the task, allowing them to try even if the odds of success are low. You should also consider what the item will do to the balance of your campaign. If you don't want your Acolytes running around brandishing power swords with plasma pistols built into the hilts, make this decision now instead of trying to take them away after the fact.

At the same time, work with the Acolyte to apply the "common sense factor" to the project. If the goal is to create a lightweight, assault version of a basic weapon, it doesn't really make sense to double the range, as carbines typically have shorter range than their full-sized counterparts. Increasing the Damage for a weapon would also tend to reduce the number of shots per clip to make room for the larger rounds.

The GM should assign an appropriate Difficulty, Duration, and Cost to the task or item the Acolyte defined in the previous step. Make sure to look at factors that differ from the base item, such as weight, size and performance.

#### **Difficulty**

The Difficulty in creating an object works the same way as the Difficulty in any other Test. Thus, wiring two power cells together to make a larger power supply would be much less difficult than tinkering with the innards of an auspex to extend its range. Table 9-4: Crafting Difficulties and some of the expanded Trade Skill descriptions give guidelines in assigning Difficulties to projects.

#### **Duration**

Along with a Difficulty, each task also has an associated Duration. Keep in mind that difficult tasks need not necessarily have long durations, and easy tasks may very well take a long time. A miner digging a trench to expose an underlying

#### Table 9–4: Crafting Difficulties

layer of rock in hard-packed soil is not terribly complex, but without help, it's likely to take quite some time.

Unlike Difficulty, where the GM assigns a flat modifier to the task, Duration represents a range of time, since the Acolyte can't anticipate all the difficulties—or lack of inspiration—he may encounter along the way. The Acolyte should roll 2d10 and consult Table 9-5: Crafting Durations:

Dividing Tasks: For tasks with Durations of months or years, dividing them into logical components may allow a number of tradesmen to focus on the portions most suited to their Skills. A wright may work on the control system of a speeder while a smith forges armoured plates for the hull. While this technique can save time for the overall duration of the project, it adds time to each portion. Each craftsman may accomplish their individual task well, but they may not integrate well into the final product.

The GM and Acolyte must work together to divide the job into reasonable sub-tasks, though the GM has final approval for this process. If the Acolytes were looking to improve the performance of their groundcar, they might

| Duration | Time Range       | Time Interval | Examples                                                        |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minutes  | 2d10 × 5 minutes | 5 minutes     | A quick sketch; cooking a meal.                                 |
| Hours    | 2d10 × 1 hour    | 1 hour        | Repairing a security system; repairing minor damage.            |
| Shifts   | 2d10 × 6 hours   | 6 hours       | Adding a fire selector to a weapon; designing a jacket.         |
| Days     | 2d10 × 1 day     | 1 day         | Creating a custom set of armour; repairing major damage.        |
| Weeks    | 2d10 × 1 week    | 1 week        | Complex improvements to a basic item; sculpting a small statue. |
| Months   | 2d10 × 1 month   | 1 month       | Duplicating an illuminated text; complex item designs.          |
| Years    | 2d10 × 1 year    | 1 year        | Erecting a structure; vehicle designs and improvements.         |

#### Table 9-5: Crafting Durations

agree with the GM that this could be divided into work on the engine and work on the frame and suspension. Once, divided, the GM assigns a new Duration and Difficulty for each sub-task.

After defining the sub-tasks, add an additional task for combining all the parts together. The Difficulty of this task is equal to that of the most difficult sub-task. For each subtask over two, increase the Difficulty by one level. Thus, if a Challenging (+0) task has been divided into four sub-tasks, the Difficulty of combining them would be Hard (–20). If this would increase the Difficulty beyond Very Hard (–30), then the craftsman must reduce the number of sub-tasks. The larger the number of individual contributors, the more difficult it will be to combine them in the end.

#### **Cost**

Determining the Cost of an item can be challenging, especially in cases where there are few examples of similar items, but you'll quickly develop a knack for it. In most cases, determining Cost falls into two broad categories: constructing an item out of raw materials or combining existing items into a hybrid. Penning a map or building a bunker are examples of the former, and constructing a boltgun combined with a hand flamer would fit into the second category.

For instances where the new item is a combination of existing ones, estimating Cost is relatively straightforward. Add the costs of the basic items, and then add a reasonable cost for the materials necessary to combine them from Table

| Table 9–6: Material Costs       |                                        |                                                                              |  |  |  |

9-6: Material Costs. Thus, if an Acolyte wanted to build an auspex display into his carapace helmet so it would read out on his visor, the GM can add the costs of the two items plus the cost of some complex components.

The Cost for building things from scratch can require more creativity, but needn't be intimidating. The key is to start from a known point and modify appropriately. Table 9-6: Material Costs is intended to be a starting point and guide rather than a painful exercise in maths. If your Acolytes are building a watchtower from steel beams, feel free to approximate the amount of steel required, arriving at a cost that makes sense rather than painstakingly researching structural design.

#### **Example**

*The GM looks at Gyth's project and reasons that since cameleoline technology is fairly advanced and few outside the Adeptus Mechanicus would have any knowledge of its workings, the Difficulty will be Hard (–20). Since it is a complex improvement, he assigns a Duration of weeks. The cost of Guard flak armour is 300 Thrones, and the cost of a cameleoline cloak is 500 Thrones. The GM rules that 200 Thrones worth of advanced components are needed to combine the two, for a total Cost of 1000 Thrones. Gyth pays the Cost of the materials and then rolls 2d10 for the Time Range. She gets a 5 and a 3, resulting in eight weeks of estimated work. Fortunately this is about the same amount of time that her c ompanions will be investigating the archives of Hive Tarsus.*

#### **Step Three: Make Adjustments**

A number of factors can affect the Difficulty, Duration, or Cost of a task, some of which may be imposed by circumstance and some of which are chosen by the Acolyte. These include adjusting the Duration to make tasks easier or shorter, the tools or workspace used and the quality of raw materials.

You may voluntarily adjust Duration by one-step up or down for a corresponding adjustment to the Difficulty. Thus, for each step up in Duration, the GM-assigned Difficulty goes down by one level. However, if you decide the task will take more time than you have, you can also do the opposite, decreasing the Duration by one-step and increasing the Difficulty by one level. Any adjustment of Duration below "minutes" has no effect, and any adjustment above "years" multiplies the Duration roll by 2. Any change in Difficulty below Easy (+30) has no effect, and any shift beyond Very Hard (–30) means that the task is beyond the Acolyte's current abilities.

If the Acolyte has access to tools, workspace or materials of Good or Best Craftsmanship, the Difficulty or Duration of a project can also be reduced. Items of Good Craftsmanship can reduce Difficulty by one-step. Items of Best Craftsmanship reduce the Difficulty and Duration by one-step. Use the highest Craftsmanship modifier only in the case of multiple items that would affect the task. Thus if a tech-priest had access to a forge world Mechanicus workshop of Best Craftsmanship and also raw materials of Good Craftsmanship, only the modifier for the workshop would apply.

#### **Example**

*Gyth is fortunate enough to have access to an Inquisitorial workshop with tools of Good Craftsmanship at Hive Sibellus, which reduces the Difficulty of her task to Difficult (–10). She also is using Good Craftsmanship flak armour, but since she has already applied a Craftsmanship bonus, it does not produce another shift. Though she could reduce the Difficulty to Challenging (+0) by extending the Duration to eight months, she decides that her fellow Acolytes will be finished with their investigation long before then.*

#### **Step Four: Tests**

You Test the appropriate Trade Skill at the end of the Time Interval indicated by Table 9-5: Crafting Durations. This assumes you spend a full six hours per day—or the entire Time Interval for shorter durations—working on the project. If you spend less than the requisite amount of time per day, that day does not count towards earning a Test. Success on the roll reduces the time to complete the job by one Time Interval, but degrees of success or a failure of three or more has additional effects.

For each degree of success, you may either reduce the time necessary to complete the project by an additional Time Interval or apply it towards improving the final Craftsmanship of the work.

Failures of three or more degrees indicate that a setback has occurred. This both adds one Time Interval to the remaining Duration and subtracts one from the accumulated degrees of success. Note successive failures can lead to a negative total for degrees of success.

#### **Improving Craftsmanship**

You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear, nor a Best Craftsmanship target pistol from a Poor Craftsmanship underhive auto snub. An item's Craftsmanship may only ever improve by rebuilding it. The GM should assign a Difficulty one-step higher than creation of the existing item, but a Duration of one-step lower, adding in additional material costs as appropriate. An existing item's Craftsmanship can only ever go up by one level, no matter how good the Test.

#### **Cooperation**

Craftsman can combine their efforts for particularly complex or long tasks, provided the GM feels such assistance is realistic. While a large number of miners could very well work together on a new tunnel, only one technomat could reasonably work at soothing the machine-spirit of a small cogitator.

These rules add to the Assistance rules on page 185 in Dark Heresy for purposes of Crafting and Investigation.

When several workers with the appropriate Trade Skill combine their efforts, one is designated as the primary craftsman and the others as subordinate craftsmen. When counting the results of a Test, the primary craftsman counts only success or failure, without taking degrees of success into account. Each subordinate's success then counts as a degree of success for purposes of Craftsmanship or reducing the time for completion. If any individual fails his Test by three or more degrees, all other rolls for that Time Interval are considered failures in addition to the normal setbacks! You will quickly find that too many subordinates slow progress considerably.

Note that brute labour, such as workers carrying raw materials or slag, do not count as Cooperation; only the skilled work of another tradesman uses this system.

#### **Setting Things Aside**

The Inquisition seldom allows its Acolytes much free time to pursue their own trades, so it's likely they may have to set their tasks aside while the needs of the Imperium occupies their time. So long as they don't set things aside for too long, it won't result in a setback. However, if you set aside a task for a period of time equal to the next higher Time Interval, then you suffer a setback as if you'd failed a Test by three or more degrees. The project suffers a second setback if put aside for a Time Interval two higher than the original. Additional setbacks occur at each higher Time Interval. So a task with a Duration of weeks would suffer the first setback after being put aside for one month, and a second setback after being ignored for one year. For Time Intervals of greater than one year, simply double the previous one.

#### **Example**

*Gyth spends at least six hours a day for one week in the Inquisitorial workshop while her fellow Acolytes work in the Administratum archive, earning a Test at the end of the week. She has Strength 42 and the Trade (Armourer) skill with no Skill Mastery. Gyth rolls a 21, achieving two degrees of success. Since she knows her time is short, she chooses to apply them to further reduce the time necessary to complete the armour, leaving five weeks of work to go!*

#### **Step Five: Complete the Task**

After rolling the final success, the work is complete. However, simply completing the task doesn't tell you the quality of the end result. The degrees of success accumulated throughout the task process have the capacity to yield a result of superior—or inferior—Craftsmanship. Tally the total degrees of success allocated to improving Craftsmanship, subtract the number of setbacks, and look up the result on Table 9-7: Determining Craftsmanship.

| Table 9-7: Determining Craftsmanship |                                                               |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

#### **Failure**

There may come a time for particularly difficult projects when it becomes clear that a substandard result, or even failure, is unavoidable. If you accumulate more than five negative degrees of success, the project has failed and all materials utilised in it are lost. You may also voluntarily abandon a project at any time during the Tests, yielding the same result.
