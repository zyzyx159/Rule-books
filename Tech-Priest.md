*"Bzzttt… our alliance must terminate here—your objectives are no longer compatible with mine."*

— Quintass Delta III, Mech-Wright, The Lathes.

T The Cult Mechanicus holds a virtual monopoly on technology. Its tenets and beliefs permeate through their rituals into the common superstition of Imperial citizens. The Adeptus Mechanicus is run by the Tech-Priests of Mars, an insular priesthood that worship the Machine God and whose goal is to harvest all the lost technology that has been missing since before the Age of Strife. The lowest ranks of Tech-Priests have mainly maintenance and construction duties, but as a Tech-adept progresses and acquires greater knowledge, he is relieved from the more trivial day-to-day tasks and allowed to study and learn of the greater mysterious and missing techniques that have prevented any kind of progressive development in the Imperium's technological base.

All Tech-Priests have an advanced grasp of how to maintain most of the standard technologies that are used throughout the Imperium. There are also many specialities a Tech-Priest can study, such as the biologius, xenology and the use of rediscovered weaponry to name but a few.

Tech-Priests are not confined to Mars or the numerous Forge Worlds that are scattered throughout the galaxy. Many are given leave to seek out lost technologies or investigate rumoured sightings of STC templates. It is on these missions Tech-Priests most likely come into contact with an Inquisitor or a cell.

The relationship between the Inquisition and the Priesthood of Mars has been a stormy one, ranging from outright hostility to merely strained in less tumultuous times. Nevertheless, the two powerful organisations have worked together many times especially when it is perceived to be in the common interest. In these situations a Tech-Priest may be present in a cell. His knowledge of Imperial, and even xenos, technology will always prove useful. A Tech-Priest may even have the means, via a neural plug, to communicate directly with the machine spirit of certain technologies, making him a very desirable ally. However, the Tech-Priests are fiercely independent and distrustful of others who do not worship the Machine God; they will be cold, methodical and terse. A Tech-Priest Acolyte rarely fits in well with a team of non-Mechanicus personnel.

The appearance of Tech-Priests can be frightening, even terrorinducing, to those who have never had contact with such beings before. As much as fifty to sixty per cent of a Tech-Priest's body may have been replaced with bionics and even the addition of extra limbs like mechadendrites or in-built weaponry. This proportion of organic to machine parts increases as the Tech-Priest gets older. The Tech-Priests themselves explain that these changes bring them ever closer to their Machine God, the Omnissiah, and away from the weak frailties of the flesh. It is not uncommon for the most senior Tech-Priests, known as Magos, to be almost entirely machine, the last piece of withered organic material losing what was left of its humanity centuries ago. An Inquisitor is always wary when allying with a Magos as chances are they are following their own agenda, which is often quite separate from that of the other Acolytes.

# **Tech-Priest Abilities In Game Terms**

Whilst the abilities of Tech-Priests are a complicated blend of technology, mummery and religion, it is sometimes useful to know how to translate these seemingly miraculous powers into game terms.

As far as Player Characters are concerned, Tech-Priest powers are expressed in a very simple way. In Dark Heresy, each character in the Tech-Priest career starts play with the Mechanicus Implants trait. This represents the various augmentations that have been fitted inside the character. (See **[page 27](#page-27-0)** for the full details on each of these implants.) By spending Experience Points on various Talents, the character learns to use these implants to generate all sorts of effects, from bolts of bio-electrical energy to powerful magnetic fields.

The augmentations described in the Mechanicus Implants trait are so closely intertwined with the Tech-Priest's body they are not considered to be equipment. They are indistinguishable from his mortal flesh. These implants are such an integral part of a Tech-Priest that he would not survive their wholesale removal—or even want to. Life without them is no life at all. To all intents and purposes, a Tech-Priest's Wounds represent damage to both his soft tissue and these trait-specific augmentations. As a Tech-Priest heals damage, he is considered to be repairing any damage to this machinery as well as to his body.

In addition to these "free" augmentations, Tech-Priest Player Characters can also purchase other cybernetic implants, such as auger arrays, mechadendrites and bionic limbs. Unlike the augmentations granted by the Mechanicus Implants trait, these are treated just like any other cybernetic implant. They can be targeted, damaged, removed, or improved—see **Bionic Replacement Limbs & Body Parts** on **[page 153](#page-153-0)** for more details.

As ever, questions about the damage or removal of implants, and what this does to a Tech-Priest's Talents, should be adjudicated by the Game Master. No doubt this wise and august person will provide a common-sense answer, agreeable to all.

*"Yes, sir, I know the enginseer is annoyed, but we had to open the machine casing… yes, but we would have lost the Chimera if we didn't jury rig it… what? … demands penance? Front line you say? Throne… Well, if the Emperor commands…* "

Enginseers draw together their knowledge of form, energy and material compo nents into the art of tending complicated machines. Using the alchemy of prayer and ritual, they cajole machine spirits into life, finding faults and removing error from all manner of technology.

# **Tech-Priest**

*"He stood before the fan cyclers barefoot and humble. In the language of the Tech-Priests he bid the engines start, that the hive breathe easy. He struck the sacred rune, donned his boots once more, and lo! The fans began."*

Tech-Priests are initiated into the deeper mysteries of technology, and know many rites of maintenance, ignition and restarting. From simple door mechanisms to ancient tech dug from mouldering ruins, Tech-Priests seek out the many forms of the Omnissiah, to add yet more knowledge to the data crypts of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

# **Technomancer**

*"Minds sharp as knives, and know their way round the Administratum too. Don't cross a technomancer, especially if you work on a spaceship. You'll be reassigned to a leaky rig before you can sign the aquila."*

Technomancers apply all their considerable mental powers to extracting information that may be of use to the Machine Cult. Be it currying favour with the Ecclesiarchy to interrogation of xenos prisoners, Technomancers conjure answers with ruthless logical efficiency.

# **Cyber Seer**

*"They ain't quite human no more. I mean, more than yer average Tech-Priest. No one could keep all that… you know… dangerous stuff in their skull an' stay normal."*

Cyber Seers delve into the forbidden and occult matters of machinery with frightening zeal. From unnatural geometries to warp-touched autonoma, Cyber Seers do not shirk or sway from looking upon the damning and heretical in their quest for knowledge.
