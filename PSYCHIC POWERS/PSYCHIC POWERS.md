*"My blade can shear through adamantium as if it were paper, but it is a blunt club compared to the edge of my will."* — Inquisitor Kaede, Ordo Hereticus.

Within the Imperium of man, some people are born different. Some fickle turn of fate or chance twist in the genome has seen them join the growing ranks of psychic individuals within the human race. These psykers labour under a blessing and a curse. They have the rare talent to draw power from the warp, the hidden dimension of Chaos that lurks beneath the fabric of reality, and shape it into all manner of strange and supernatural effects. Using such power, however, comes with a terrible risk.

Whether they know it or not, the mind of each psyker shines brightly within the otherworldly dimension of the warp, or immaterium as it is also known. This psychic realm is home to unspeakable beings, hungry predators that look upon such soulfires with great anticipation. The denizens of the immaterium—warp beasts, Daemons and worse—find great sport in weak and unprotected minds. An unwary psyker is easily attacked, consumed or used as a gateway from the warp to the physical realm.

Psykers are regarded in many different ways across the Imperium's countless worlds. On the more primitive planets, they are thought of as shamans, witches and sorcerers. More sophisticated societies are usually aware of psychic abilities and refer to psykers by other titles such as "gifted" or "the touched", or more pejoratively, "witches". But in almost all cases, and on all worlds, they are feared for the darkness and chaos they can bring down on those around them.

There are many that believe psykers represent a gross perversion of all that humanity is, and a constant reminder of the terrible powers of the warp. This idea seems to hold some weight as the majority of psykers succumb to madness and ruin, often at the cost of countless other lives. Those that can master psychic power, however, become a prized, if somewhat dangerous, commodity to the Imperium. The Inquisition, especially, makes great use of psykers in rooting out the enemies of mankind, fighting fire with fire as it were.

*"The dominion of Man the Animal is done. The age of Man the Psyker has just begun!"*

— Heretic Thaylon Sol, final words.

*"Man only spoke of it once. He say bein' psyker not so unlike us spine-divers. Spend all your time with your parts in sea-dark, awaitin' the day when d' fang-fish bite."*

— Spectoris Agri-hand, Dermay.

*"If the worst happens, and your Savant-Warrant falls to corruption, pray the Psykana conditioning holds. If you're lucky, he'll fall upon his mercy blade before anything too terrible can manifest. If he doesn't open his veins… well, that's a whole other lecture."*

— Officer Training, Gunmetallicus 104th.
# **Types of Psykers**

There are many roles within the Imperium that utilise psykers in some way or another. Some of these roles are revered and vital, whilst others are reviled utterly. However people feel about psykers, they are as much a part of the vast Imperium of Man as the Imperial Guard, the Administratum and even the Emperor Himself.
### **Astropaths**

The great sweep of the Imperium of Man far outstrips the reach of normal communications in size and breadth. Astropaths are capable of broadcasting and receiving messages across the vastness of space, although a message may be delayed, mangled. or even lost by the turbulence of warp space. By their powers, the astropaths can do what no others can; reach beyond the limits of time and space to allow humanity to continue communicating between its far-flung domains in the vastness of interstellar space. At times the availability and talent of an astropath has determined whether entire worlds have lived or died, and whether millions have survived in the glorious light of the Emperor, or fallen to the darkness of humanity’s enemies. In the nightmare depths of the empyrean, the astropaths listen to the missives of mankind, and occasionally, those of a viler cast, braving terrible and constant danger to their sanity and souls in order to allow the Imperium to function as a coherent entity. The Adeptus Astra Telepathica oversees the arduous task of recruiting and training astropaths in service to the Imperium, and regulating their number in operations.

Astropaths themselves are born with the psyker’s gift; taken by the Black Ships and selected owing to the nature of their gifts and other arcane criteria—to become astropaths, by undergoing years of training and extensive indoctrination culminating in a techno-arcane ritual initiation called “soul binding” to the God Emperor. This process is what makes an astropath what he is, and without it there would be no astropaths at all. The benefits of the soul binding are that it allows the astropaths some safety while opening their minds to the warp’s currents in communications from afar, and sifting the truth from the psychic static and perilous lies whispered beyond, and projecting their own messages into that void to be heard by others of their own kind. The soul binding is not without its price however, and despite the quality of candidates selected and their extensive preparation, not all survive or retain their sanity. Those that do are almost all permanently blinded by the ordeal, although in most cases their abilities more than make up for this deficiency, and others might never know, but for their disturbing whited-out eyes, or in some cases, empty, shrunken eye sockets. What the soul binding does on a fundamental level is combine the psyker’s own abilities with the merest fraction of those of the Emperor which transforms him and protects him in a way that makes the astropath unique among human psykers.
### **Imperial Psykers**

Also known as Sanctionites, these psykers are individuals deemed strong enough to serve the Imperium without significant dangers to others. Imperial Psykers serve in many parts of the Empire of Man, nominally as vassals to the Adeptus Astra Telepathica; from the Administratum to the Imperial military, within merchant houses, or even for planetary governors and nobles. Their survival was made possible by a stringent processes of selection, indoctrination, and training known as sanctioning; a process similar to, but nowhere near as thorough or all-encompassing
as the soul binding an astropath must endure. Sanctioning exists both to weed out the weak and the already corrupted as well as to determine what shape the psyker’s future will take in the Imperium’s grand design. Imperial Psykers often blend into their seconded post with surprising skill. Clad in monkish robes or secure behind scholarly titles, they often appear indistinguishable from the vast ranks of Administratum adepts—that is, until they must call upon their eldritch powers. Others serve within carefully constructed roles such as the Savant Militant of the Imperial Guard, and it is also not unheard of for certain agents of the Imperium to serve in a far less restricted fashion due to their strength of will or training, including—for those of supreme iron will—the Holy Inquisition itself. Rumours persist that a few Rogue Traders over the millennia have been psykers as well. 

Sanctioned psykers follow various schools of training, known collectively as the Scholastica Psykana. Much like the Imperial Creed, the exact teachings of the Scholastica Psykana may vary from sector to sector (or even planet to planet) yet the intent remains the same—training dutiful psykers to serve the Imperium. Consequently, no image of the psyker in service to the Emperor should be considered definitive; the warp’s perils, as well as human vice and weakness, have undone many.
### **Navigators**

This hereditary line of abhumans serves the Emperor and the Imperium by using their innate ability to visually perceive the treacherous shoals and stormy courses of the warp, via a psychic ‘warp eye’ which often itself manifests as a visible mutation. They are not psykers in the "true" sense, but rather the inheritors of a specifically engineered ability whose true nature is not fully understood, even by those who possess it. Their gifts allow them to peer into the same Immaterium beheld by those gifted with psychic prowess but with singular purpose and acuity, enabling them to actively navigate a ship through the warp itself with a skill unmatched by psyker or machine alike. Their noble houses form an ancient Imperial institution known as the Navis Nobilite, which has close ties to every major aspect of wider Imperial society, from the Imperial Navy, to the Adeptus Mechanicus, the diverse mercantile powers of the Imperial Commercia, and to those brash and infamous explorers of the unknown, the Rogue Traders.

Few and far between yet constantly in great demand, Navigators can sell their services at a ruinous price, and most live quite comfortably in palatial towers on the starships to which they are bonded. For many this is a lifetime appointment, the ship and its owners selected by the Navigator's house based on any number of political and economic exigencies, and often the individual Navigator is effectively a prisoner aboard the vessel—albeit one of a superbly luxurious nature.
### **Sacrifices**

The Black Ships of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica sweep up great tides of psykers as they ply their way across the Imperium. The vast majority of the psykers gathered in this way are found to be too weak and pliant in soul to stand against the corruption of the warp, and they are passed on to the care of the Adeptus Astronomica. This august body helps the Emperor maintain the Astronomican, the great psychic beacon of Terra. By burning the very stuff of their souls, the Astromonican's martyrs power the Emperor's Golden Throne, sending astral light flaring through the warp. By providing a single fixed point, the Astronomican forms a vital part of warp travel, allowing Navigators to effectively triangulate their position. Perhaps a thousand such martyrs are sacrificed to the Emperor in this manner each day. Most consider this a small price to pay in return for the protection and guidance offered by the Master of Mankind—especially since those so fed into the Golden Throne were likely a psychic disaster in the making.
### **Latent Psykers**

There are some psykers that are unaware of their abilities. They may hail from a primitive world ignorant of proper ways, or else their powers might manifest in subtle ways, such as strange luck with dice, "poltergeist activity", uncanny hunches and so on. These psykers might never be detected, or more likely they might become host to all manner of warp corruption. Some might be infected with weird psychic parasites which slowly gnaw away at their mind until insanity results. Others might become host to Daemons, or even be snatched away into the warp to make a plaything for the Ruinous Ones which lurk there. Some have been known to flower into full-blown psychic ability—a phenomenon known as emerging—under stress, often with spectacular results. In any case, latent psykers are considered dangerous weak points, and the agents of the Black Ships are especially eager to hunt them down.
### **Sorcerers**

Some psykers choose the path of damnation in their quest for power. Heeding the whispered lure of Daemonic promises, they give up their souls in return for secret knowledge, raw power and mastery of things that man was not meant to know. These psykers embrace the Dark Gods as their lords and masters, making vile pacts to further their own depraved avarice. They are despised and feared for their unnatural practises and Daemonic taint. The Inquisition regards these sorcerers as highly dangerous foes, for they often act as doors through which Daemons may enter reality to cause further madness and destruction.
### **Xenos Psykers**

Outside of humanity’s multitudes there are also alien races who possess psykers of their own, although in often staggeringly different forms and ranges of ability than their human counterparts; from the brutish, thunderous force of the ork ‘weirdboyz’ to the nightmarish psy-arcana of the mysterious fra’al. Of these, the ever-dwindling number of warlocks and farseers of the insidious eldar are known to be among the most subtle and powerful, but also caged by ritual and fear lest they be consumed by their own race’s primordial sins. Their mastery of the psyker’s arts is measured by long and cautious centuries and most will never attain the brief, bright-burning power of the humans they so scorn.
### **Untouchables**

Untouchables are individuals who have no warp signature. They are not psykers—in fact, completely the opposite. Their presence frequently acts as a damper on psychic activity, lessening or even completely halting its effects. Untouchables, like psykers, actually have different grades of "ability", though only the sinister Culexus Temple of the Officio Assassinorum have been able to study them closely due to their extreme rarity. Their strange aura makes most folk uncomfortable around them, and for this reason they are often loners, outcasts, and social pariahs. Of all Imperial institutions, the Inquisition makes the greatest use of Untouchables.

# **Measuring Psychic Ability**

Psychic ability typically manifests between the ages of ten and twenty, though there are psykers who have emerged in infancy or later in life. What triggers latent psychic ability is unknown to Imperial scholars, though not for lack of trying. Only the rare psyker is strong enough to "stand alone" against the terrible dangers inherent in possessing psychic abilities, and even the majority of the strongest psykers still require a great deal of training to effectively utilise their abilities. In order to be properly trained, each psyker needs to go through a reckoning of their powers.

Assessing the capabilities of a psyker is a difficult and imprecise art. The primary consideration is the psyker's strength against predation and corruption from the warp. Sanctioneers have many ways of measuring this peculiar strength of will, from demanding years of devotional training, to simply intuiting with a glance. Those deemed weak and pliable are granted the Emperor's mercy, or sent to join the throngs of martyrs on Holy Terra. Those who have the strength to resist the maddening touch of the warp and exhibit some control over their gifts are then divided into groups and types, according to their powers, raw ability and finesse. Some are soul bound and become Astropaths. Others are sent out by the Adeptus Astra Telepathica to serve in various roles and to study under the auspice of the Scholastia Psykana.
## **Psykers In Dark Heresy**

For the sake of clarity, Acolyte Psykers in ***Dark Heresy*** have been graded on a **Psy Rating** scale of 1–6. This is very much game terminology, designed to make the rules simple and easy for you to use. In the 41st Millennium, Psyker abilities are not so cut and dried! There are many names for the different levels of Psyker, each with their own subtle meanings and significances. Whilst you, the player, might happily discuss Psy Ratings, your character would not know what "Psy Rating 3" means. For an idea of how differing Disciplines of psychic study grade their members, take a look at **Table: Scholastica Psykana Calixis**. This is an example of how the larger schools of the Scholastica Psykana within the Calixis Sector describe their initiates.

The Scholastica Psykana's parent organisation, the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, grades those it studies on a scale of raw power known as "The Assignment". Those whose abilities have just begun to flicker to life are graded as Omicrons, while horrifyingly strong (and blessedly rare) Alpha grade psykers can burn down entire cities and pull flyers from the air with their minds alone. Each tradition or branch of the Scholastia Psykana has a different method for measuring psychic ability. In Calixis, many prefer to group their novices by the Discipline they study, whilst others still rate the psyker on the level of training and finesse they have attained. This rating might follow a scientific numeral system, depend on mystical degrees of initiation, or use any method in between. However it is measured, the psyker is expected to study the traditions, Disciplines, powers and obligations of the Scholastica Psykana with the utmost devotion.
##### Table: Scholastica Psykana Calixis

| Psy Rating | Telekine    | Telepath/Diviner  | Biomancer       | Pyromancer | Assignment |
| :--------: | ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|     1      | Grammatican | The Crimson Aeon  | Novice Carnate  | Ignis      | Iota       |
|     2      | Rhetorite   | The Golden Aeon   | Novice Sanguis  | Cauterite  | Theta      |
|     3      | Dilectate   | The Silver Aeon   | Novice Cognate  | Pyrist     | Eta        |
|     4      | Trigmestus  | The Hermetic Aeon | Novice Tuitus   | Cinorator  | Zeta       |
|     5      | Quadrivite  | The Silent Aeon   | Novice Spiritus | Incandate  | Epsilon    |
|     6      | Iptissimus  | The Spectral Aeon | Novice Tenebrae | Crematist  | Delta      |
### **Am I A Psyker?**

To be formally considered a Psyker in game terms, a character must have one of the Psy Rating Talents. However, there are other ways to gain Psychic Powers, especially minor ones, through Talents, Traits, and even drugs. It is also possible for a character with some psychic ability to improve their level of power, effectively increasing their Rating. For details on the effects of the various Psyker Ratings and other Talents that grant Psychic Powers see **[Talents](Talents.md)**.
# **Using Psychic Abilities**

*"When you stare into the warp, the warp stares back into you."* — Scholastica Psykana aphorism.

To use a Psychic Power, a Psyker directs his will into the sea of the immaterium, pulling forth power from the warp to create an effect in realspace. To do this, the Psyker must make a **Focus Power Action**. They then make a Power Roll by rolling a number of dice up to their Psy Rating (typically 1–6) and adding their Willpower Bonus. Compare the total of the roll to the **Power's Psychic Threshold (PT)**. If this number equals or exceeds the PT, the power takes effect. Otherwise, the Psyker has been unable to gather the necessary power, or perhaps they have been repelled by something in the warp. Regardless of the cause, the power fails to manifest.

A Psyker is required to roll at least one die to manifest an ability, even if their Willpower Bonus alone would be enough to reach the Psychic Threshold. Likewise, a Psyker need not roll all their dice either—each die rolled is another chance at causing Psychic Phenomena, so moderation is always advisable when making a Power Roll.
##### **Example**
*Elyra Yivor, a Psyker with Psy Rating of 2, tries to activate a power with a PT of 13. Her Psy Rating of 2 means she can roll two dice and adds her WP Bonus, meaning she will roll 2d10+3. Rolling the dice she scores a total of 15. As she has beaten the PT she has managed to manifest the power.*

*Characters with the [Invocation Skill](skills.md#invocation) can take a Full Action prior to trying to manifest a power to gain a bonus to their Power Roll.*
### **Psychic-Foci**

One of the principle ways a Psyker can enhance or control his powers is through the use of Psychic-foci. There are many different types of psychic-foci, which range from simple tricks that are known to help focus the mind when using certain abilities, to some exceedingly rare and sophisticated devices crafted by the Adeptus Mechanicus designed to boost or amplify Psychic Power. The most famous psychic-foci in the Imperium is doubtless the Emperor's Tarot, which helps act as a powerful divinatory tool in the hands of a trained Psyker. In mechanical terms Psychic-foci add a bonus to a Psyker's Invocation skill Test.
### **Psychic Phenomena**

When a Psyker focuses their power they invite the very essence of the warp into the real world causing such things as frost to cover nearby surfaces, ghostly whispers to fill the air, and statues to weep tears of blood. These psychic disturbances, though disconcerting, are usually not dangerous outright. However, they do instantly alert others to the presence of the Psyker, and even harmless effects can cause the superstitious citizens of the Imperium to flee in terror (or arouse their ire to violence directed towards the Psyker...).

When a Psyker rolls an 9 on any of the dice used to manifest a power, they will invoke Psychic Phenomena, and must roll on **Table: Psychic Phenomena** once for each 9 rolled. Psychic Phenomena can open the doorway to darker things, and can cause a Psyker to conjure far more dangerous consequences known as the Perils of the Warp.

**Note:** Unless otherwise stated, causing Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp does not cause a Psychic Power to fail on its own. Provided the Psyker has met or exceeded the Power Threshold, both the Psychic Power and the unfortunate side effect occur at once.
##### **Example**
*Elyra Yivor is trying to conjure a Fire Bolt to smite her foes. As she has a Psy Rating of 2 she rolls two dice and adds her WP Bonus. Rolling the dice she scores a 4 and an 9. Adding these together and her WP Bonus she scores a total of 16, enough to manifest the power. However, as she rolled a 9, she must also roll on Table: Psychic Phenomena to determine what other weirdness occurs. Rolling on the table she scores a 13. So even as she flings her fiery bolts, a Grave Chill fills the air around her.*
#### **Table: Psychic Phenomena**

| Roll  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–03 | **Dark Foreboding:** A very faint breeze blows past the Psyker and those near him, and everyone nearby gets the eerie feeling that something unfortunate has just happened somewhere in the galaxy.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 03–05 | **Warp Echo:** For a few seconds, voices and other noises cause echoes regardless of surroundings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 06–08 | **Ethereal Stench:** The air around the Psyker fills with a faint smell, which can either be pleasant or noxious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 09–11 | **Mind Warp:** The psyker suffers a –5 penalty to Willpower Tests until the start of his next Turn as his own inherent phobias, suspicions, and hatreds surge to the surface of his mind in a wave of unbound emotion.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12–14 | **Grave Chill:** The temperature drops sharply for a few seconds and a fine coating of frost covers everything within 3d10 metres of the Psyker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15–17 | **Unnatural Aura:** All animals within 1d100 metres become spooked and restless; characters with Psyniscience can pinpoint the Psyker as the cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18–20 | **Memory Worm:** All people within line of sight of the Psyker forget something trivial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 21–23 | **Spoilage:** Food goes off and drink goes stale in a radius of 5d10 metres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 24–26 | **Haunting Breeze:** Moderate winds whip up around the Psyker for a few seconds, blowing light objects about and guttering fires within 3d10 metres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 27–29 | **Veil of Darkness:** For a brief moment (effectively the remainder of the Round) it seems to everyone within 3d10 metres of the Psyker that night has fallen, plunging the area into darkness.                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 33–35 | **Breath Leech:** Everyone (including the Psyker) become short of breath for one Round and cannot make any Run or Charge Actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 36–38 | **Daemonic Mask:** For a fleeting moment the Psyker takes on a Daemonic appearance and gains a Fear Rating of 1 for the remainder of the Round, but also gains 1 Corruption Point.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39–41 | **Unnatural Decay:** All plants within 3d10 metres of the Psyker wither and die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 42–44 | **Spectral Gale:** Howling winds erupt around the Psyker, lifting him slightly into the air and forcing both him and anyone within 4d10 metres to make an **Easy (+30) Agility Test** or be knocked to the ground.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45–47 | **Bloody Tears:** Blood weeps from stone and wood within 3d10 metres of the Psyker. If there are any pictures of people or statues in this radius, they appear to be crying blood.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 48–50 | **The Earth Protests:** The ground suddenly shakes and everyone (including the Psyker) within a 5d10 metre radius must make a **Routine (+10) Agility Test** or be knocked down.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 51–53 | **Actinic Discharge:** Static electricity fills the air within 5d10 metres causing hair to stand on end and unprotected electronics to short out, while the Psyker is briefly wreathed in eldritch lightning.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54–56 | **Warp Ghosts:** Ghostly apparitions fill the air for 3d10 metres around the Psyker, flying around and howling in pain for a few brief moments. Everyone in the radius (including the Psyker) must test against a Fear rating of 1.                                                                                                                                          |
| 57–59 | **Falling Upwards:** Everything within 2d10 metres of the Psyker (including the Psyker himself) rises 1d10 metres into the air as gravity briefly ceases. Almost immediately, everything crashes back to the ground, suffering [Falling Damage](injury%20and%20healing.md#falling) as appropriate for the<br>distances fallen.                                               |
| 60–62 | **Banshee Howl:** A shrill keening rings out across the immediate area, shattering glass and every mortal creature able to hear it (including the Psyker) to make a Toughness Test or be deafened for 1d10 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 63–65 | **The Furies:** The Psyker is thrown to the ground by unseen hands and thrashes about for a few moments as winds howl about within 6d10 metres of him, lifting up light objects and forcing those in the area to make Agility Tests or be blown down. The Psyker is knocked prone, suffering 1d5 Impact Damage that ignores Armour and must test against a Fear rating of 2. |
| 66–68 | **Shadow of the Warp:** For a split second the world changes in appearance and everyone within 1d100 metres has a glimpse at the heart of the warp. Everyone in the area (including the Psyker) must make a **Difficult (–10) Willpower Test** or gain 1d5 Insanity Points and Corruption Points.                                                                            |
| 69–71 | **Tech Scorn:** The machine spirits reject your unnatural ways. All technology devices within 5d10 metres that are not warded malfunction momentarily and [all ranged weapons Jam](combat.md#weapon%20jams). Characters with any augmetics or cybernetic implants must pass an **Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test** or suffer 1d5 Damage which ignores Armour.                  |
| 72–74 | **Warp Madness:** A violent ripple of tainted discord causes all creatures within 2d10 metres (with the exception of the Psyker) to become Frenzied for one Round. They also gain 1d5 Corruption Points unless they can pass a **Difficult (–10) Willpower Test**.                                                                                                           |
| 75+   | **Perils of the Warp:** Invoking the Psychic Power calls down a maelstrom of warp energy power. Roll on **Table: Perils of the Warp** below, and apply the results to the Psyker.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
### **Perils of the Warp**

The warp is a dangerous and unpredictable entity and every time a Psyker draws from it he risks insanity, ruin, death, and things even worse than that. When a Psyker invokes Psychic Phenomena there is a chance that it might actually indicate that something far, far worse has occurred. Psykers who have rolled 75 or more on **Table: Psychic Phenomena** must immediately roll on **Table: Perils of the Warp**.

In addition to any other effects, whenever a Psyker invokes the Perils of the Warp he gains 1 Corruption Point. This is cumulative with any Corruption Points that may be gained as a result of a particular Peril of the Warp.

| 06–09 | **Warp Burn:** A violent burst of energy from the warp smashes into the Psyker's mind, sending him reeling. He suffers 2d5 Energy Damage, ignoring Armour, and is Stunned for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The Psyker cannot use any powers for the next hour and gains 1d5+5 Corruption Points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25–30 | **Locked In:** The power cages the Psyker's mind in an ethereal prison, tormented by hideous visions of the warp. The Psyker falls to the ground in a catatonic state. Each Round thereafter, he must make a **Difficult (–10) Willpower Test** as a Full Action. On a success, his mind is freed and restored to his body. The experience is singularly unpleasant but the Psyker is otherwise unharmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31–38 | **Chronological Incontinence:** Time warps around the Psyker. The character winks out of existence and reappears in 1d10 Rounds (or one minute if you're using Narrative Time). He suffers one point of permanent Toughness and Intelligence Damage as his body and mind rebel against the experience, and gains 1d5 Corruption Points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39–46 | **Psychic Mirror:** The Psyker's power is turned upon him. Resolve the power's effects as normal but the power targets the Psyker instead. Should the power be of benefit, such as Far Sight or Healer, it deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage to the Psyker instead of the intended effect. Armour offers the Psyker no protection against this Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 47–55 | **Warp Whispers:** The ghostly voices of Daemons fill the air within 4d10 metres of the Psyker. Everyone in the area (including the Psyker) must make a **Hard (–20) Willpower Test** or gain 1d5 Corruption Points and suffer an equal amount of Willpower Damage. In addition, whether or not the Psyker passes the Willpower Test, he still suffers an additional 1d5+5 Willpower Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56–61 | **Vice Versa:** The Psyker's mind is thrown out of his body and into another nearby creature or person. The Psyker and a random being within 50 metres swap minds for 1d10 Rounds. This may include fellow Acolytes, beasts and vermin, or even enemy combatants. Each creature retains its Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship during the swap, but gain the other Characteristics of the new body. Should either body be slain, the effect immediately ends. Both beings are strangely revolted by the process and are unable to meet each other's gaze for some time afterwards. Each gains 1d5 Insanity Points for the experience. If there are no creatures within this range, the Psyker must make a Willpower Test or become catatonic for 1d5 Rounds whilst his mind wanders the warp. This journey causes 1d10 Willpower Damage, 1d10 Intelligence Damage, and 1d10 Corruption Points. |
| 62–67 | **Dark Summoning:** A Lesser Daemon pops into existence within 3d10 metres of the Psyker for a number of Rounds equal to 1d5 plus the daemon's Toughness Bonus. The Psyker's turn ends immediately, and the daemon It detests the Psyker and trains its attacks on the fool that summoned it. It will not attack anyone else, even if others attack it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 68–72 | **Rending the Veil:** The air vibrates with images of cackling daemons and the kaleidoscopic taint of the warp is rendered visible. All sentient creatures with an Intelligence characteristic of 20 or greater within 1d100 metres must test against Fear (2). The Psyker must Test against Fear (4) instead. This effect lasts for 1d5 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 73–78 | **Blood Rain:** A psychic storm erupts, covering an area of 5d10 metres in which everyone must pass a Strength Test or be knocked to the ground. In addition to howling winds and the skies raining blood, any Psychic Powers used in the area automatically invoke Perils of the Warp for 1d5 rounds, in addition to any Psychic Phenomena those powers cause. The Psyker gains 1d5+1 Corruption Points for his trouble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 79–82 | **Cataclysmic Explosion:** The Psyker's power overloads, arcing out in great bolts of warp energy. Anyone within 2d10 metres of him (including the Psyker) takes 1d10+5 Energy Damage and all of the Psyker's clothing and gear are destroyed, leaving him naked and smoking on the ground. The Psyker may use no further Psychic Powers for 1d5 hours after the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 83–86 | **Mass Possession:** Daemons ravage the mind of every living thing within 1d100 metres. Every character in the area must resist a possession attack (see the **Possession Trait**; the attacker is a random Lesser Daemon). This possession will last for no more than 2d10 rounds, after which the daemons are cast back into the warp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 87–90 | **Reality Quake:** Reality buckles around the Psyker, and an area radiating out 3d10 metres from him is sundered: solid objects alternately rot, burn, and freeze, and everyone and everything in the area takes 2d10 Rending Damage, ignoring Armour (and unable to be Dodged). Warded objects, daemons, and Untouchables suffer half the Damage rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 91–99 | **Grand Possession:** A great and terrible warp entity takes interest in the Psyker’s soul, descending from the warp to seize the mortal’s body for its own purposes. A Greater Daemon chosen by the GM attempts to possess the Psyker (see the **Possession Trait**). Even if the daemon fails, the psyker still suffers 2d10 Toughness Damage, and will forever add +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena and Perils of the Warp tables as his body now serves as a conduit to the power of the warp. If the character dies while possessed, the Greater Daemon manifests in the real world for a number of days equal to its Toughness Bonus or until it is destroyed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 100   | **Annihilation:** The Psyker is immediately and utterly destroyed, burned to nothing by the screaming fires of the Immaterium or dragged into the deepest maelstrom of the warp. The Psyker may not burn a Fate Point to recover from this death—he is irrevocably obliterated, with no evidence that he ever existed in the first place (including any of the Psyker's equipment or weapons) remaining. There is a chance that this spectacular warp eruption allows a daemonic entity of some sort to appear in the Psyker’s place. The type of daemon that appears is determined by the GM, based on how powerful the Psyker was, with more powerful Psykers drawing more powerful daemons. The percentage chance that the daemon appears is equal to the Psyker’s Willpower characteristic (roll 1d100, if the result is equal to or under the characteristic, the daemon appears).                                                        |
### **Overbleed**

A Psyker sometimes channels more warp energy than he requires to manifest a given Psychic Power. In most cases he bleeds off the excess into the Immaterium and it returns to the chaotic wellspring from which it was drawn. However, with some Psychic Powers it is possible to funnel this energy directly into manifesting greater effects. If a Psyker beats the power's Psychic Threshold by a certain amount he will gain extra effects, such as increased Range, Damage, or Duration. If a Psychic Power has this ability, it is mentioned in the entry along with the extra effects of Overbleed.

**Note:** A Psyker **cannot** refuse the additional effects of Overbleed. While most Psykers would ordinarily be pleased to see an especially impressive display of their psychic abilities, one must still accept the consequences of the manifestation even in a rare or unusual case where the Psyker would have rather not made quite such a spectacle.
### **Sustaining Psychic Abilities** 

There are a number of Psychic Powers that are worth "keeping on" for an extended length of time. Powers that can be used in such manner are referred to as being "sustainable", which is noted in their entries. Sustaining a Psychic Power for an extended period of time is very taxing and only the most proficient Psykers can accomplish it. Every 10 Rounds a power is active, the Psyker must make a new Power Roll to maintain it. This is made in exactly the same fashion as when the power was first manifested, including the number of dice used to make the Power Roll. Unlike a normal Power Roll, this is performed as a Free Action at the start of the Psyker's Turn, and cannot invoke either Psychic Phenomena or the Perils of the Warp. This Power Roll can be skipped if the Psyker's Willpower Bonus, plus one for each die rolled, is sufficient to meet or exceed the sustained power's Psychic Threshold.
#### **Sustaining Multiple Powers**

A Psyker can sustain a single Psychic Power without much effort once properly activated. However, all Power Rolls the Psyker makes while sustaining a single Psychic Power are reduced by 4. A Psyker can sustain multiple powers, but all Power Rolls get progressively more difficult as he must expend more and more of his power on maintaining the powers already in effect. A Psyker sustaining two powers reduces all Power Rolls by 8, while a Psyker sustaining three powers reduces all Power Rolls by 16. It is not possible to sustain more than four powers at once. These penalties to the Power Roll also apply to sustaining powers already in effect.
### **Cumulative Effects**

Modifiers, Characteristic Bonuses, and other benefits generated by Psychic Powers do not stack. If two powers provide the same kind of bonus, such as an increase in Strength, then only the highest applies.
### **Range and Line of Sight**

Unless noted in its description, a Psychic Power that directly targets an individual or thing requires a Psyker to have line of sight toward (or otherwise be "aware" of) the target. The target must also be within the power’s stated range.
# **Detecting Psychic Powers** 

All Psykers can, to a greater or lesser degree, feel the movements of the Immaterium about them. They are very sensitive to the warp's ebb and flow, often feeling when others of their ilk reach out to touch the psychic currents about them. All Psykers can Test [Psyniscience](skills.md#psyniscience) when Psychic Powers are used in their presence in order to help determine the source.
# **Psychic Powers**

*"Power Corrupts?"*

— Traditional meditation of the Scholastica Psykana.

Psychic powers work in much the same way as Talents or Skills and allow a Psyker to manifest effects and abilities.

An assortment of the most common Psychic Powers found in the Imperium are provided below. These are certainly not all of the powers that might be found, even within the specific Disciplines of the Scholastica Psykana, to say nothing of the particular abilities of Astropaths, Navigators, and the witches, wyrds, and sorcerers.
### **Power Format**

All Psychic Powers use the following format.
##### **Power Name**
**Threshold:** This is the amount of accumulated energy needed to bring the power forth. You must roll equal to or above this number when making a Power Roll to successfully manifest the power.
**Focus Time:** This entry describes the length of the Focus Power Action required to manifest the power. This can range from a Reaction to an Extended Action depending on the power.
**Sustained:** Yes or No. If yes, the power's effects remain in play for up to 10 Rounds. Beyond this, you must make another Power Roll to keep the power active. If no, the power's effects may remain in play or be instantaneous, though in either case the Psyker no longer needs to maintain them.
**Range:** This entry describes the power's Range. This is expressed in one of four Ranges: 
"You" indicates that the power can be cast only upon yourself; 
"Touch" indicates that you must touch a target—normally requiring a Weapon Skill Test—for the power to take effect; 
"Touch (You)" functions as touch, but you can also manifest the power on yourself; 
"Metres or Kilometres" indicates that the power takes effect at the listed distance.

A description of the power's effects follows.

**Overbleed:** If the power has additional effects for exceeding the threshold, it is listed here. This entry is absent if the power has no Overbleed effects.
### **Minor Psychic Powers**

The common techniques of most Psykers draw upon the energies of the Immaterium's purest, most elemental state, providing a broad if basic array of psychic faculties. This plethora of "lesser" abilities is collectively known as Minor Psychic Powers, and often forms the standard arsenal of most Psykers. Unlike the more powerful Psychic Disciplines, these powers are relatively easy to learn and use, often with a correspondingly lower Psychic Threshold. While ambitious Psykers may aspire to mastering the Disciplines, not many possess the requisite combination of skill and natural aptitude to gain true authority beyond the Minor Psychic Powers. 

Most [Psy Rating Talents](talents.md#psy%20rating) provide a number of Minor Psychic Powers each time they are purchased, and further powers can be obtained by purchasing the [Minor Psychic Power Talent](talents.md#minor%20psychic%20power) according to your Career Advances.
### **The Psychic Disciplines**

There are a number of different groupings of psychic abilities, which are referred to as Psychic Disciplines by the Scholastica Psykana. Informally known as "Major" or "Discipline" Powers, psychic abilities drawn from these schools are far more powerful than the Minor Psychic Powers that younger or less capable Psykers learn, but also require a commensurately higher level of focus to manifest. Because each Psychic Discipline requires significant, focused training that does not easily translate well between them, it is easier by far for a Psyker to learn multiple powers from one Discipline then try to learn from several Disciplines at once. Mastering a particular Psychic Discipline is considered to be a great milestone for a Psyker which only the most adroit will ever achieve.

Beginning with [Psy Rating 3](talents.md#psy%20rating%203) each new Psy Rating Talent you purchase provides you with a number of Psychic Powers from your Discipline. Further "Discipline" Powers can be obtained by purchasing the [Psychic Power Talent](talents.md#psychic%20power) according to your Career Advances.

The following Psychic Disciplines are represented by the Scholastica Psykana Calixis:

**[Biomancy](BIOMANCY.md):** The art of sculpting flesh to conform to one's will.

**[Divination](divination.md):** The art of reading past, present and future in the shadows of the immaterium.

**[Pyromancy](pyromancy.md):** The art of controlling heat and flame.

**[Telekinetics](telekinetics.md):** The art of translating thought into physical force.

**[Telepathy](telepathy.md):** The art of reading and controlling minds.
#### **Discipline Mastery**

Each Discipline Power you acquire represents a discrete segment of that Discipline's teachings and its greater philosophy regarding psychic ability as a whole, and gaining additional powers grants you increasing insight into that Discipline. Once you have learnt ten or more powers of a particular Discipline you are said to have mastered it, turning your intimate knowledge of that Discipline's teachings into a firmer grasp on your psychic abilities. Those who have mastered a Discipline are far more powerful than their novice cohorts, capable of manifesting powers quickly and efficiently. 

After you have achieved Discipline Mastery the Psychic Threshold of all of that Discipline's powers are reduced by 5, making it easier to achieve Overbleed and allowing you to roll fewer dice when making a Power Roll.
## **Minor Psychic Powers**

Minor Psychic Powers are the first psychic abilities that novice psykers learn as they begin to develop their gift. While far less powerful than the Discipline Powers of the Scholastica Psykana, they still represent a broad array of useful abilities that are relatively easy to learn, and their low Power Threshold means they can be sustained with less effort. Even the extraordinarily rare Primaris Psykers, the Psykana's most gifted members, still often rely on these abilities.

##### **Call Creatures**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 1km radius

You call a number of simple-minded creatures within range to travel to your location. Creatures called depend on the nature of the environment, though the sorts of creatures called may include rats, ash slugs, and other kinds of vermin. If no such creatures are likely to be in the area, the power has no effect. Under most circumstances, 1d10 such creatures appear after 2d10 minutes have passed. The creatures are not compelled to serve the Psyker; they simply appear and behave as normal for their species.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the power's Range by 1km.
##### **Call Item**
**Threshold:** 5
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Unlimited

You summon a specially prepared item to instantly appear in your hand. To prepare the object, you must spend one hour in deep meditation, infusing the object with your psychic imprint, and marking it with glyphs and runes. The object must be small and light enough to be easily carried in one hand. You may only have one prepared item at a time, and manifesting this power again ends the preparation on a previous item. You may summon the prepared item to your hand across any distance, even across the void between worlds and star systems, but you cannot summon it through a warded area, Gellar field, void shield, and so on.
##### **Chameleon**
**Threshold:** 7
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You cause reality to blur around you, distorting your image and allowing you to blend in with your surroundings. You gain a +30 bonus to Concealment Tests. In addition, all opponents using ranged weapons to attack you suffer a –20 penalty to their Ballistic Skill Tests.
##### **Cipher Seed**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Touch

You can attach a simple message to an individual, which is passed into the mind of a designated recipient via touch. You implant the message in the target, who then unknowingly carries it with him until touched by the proper individual. The message then passes into the mind of the recipient upon contact. This allows for the passage of truly secure messages.

The message can be a symbol or a sentence of no more words than your Willpower Bonus. The target is unaware that he is carrying your message (unless you choose to tell him, of course), but the power can be detected in the target's presence as normal, and use of the Mind Scan power can reveal the message to another Psyker. The designated recipient of the message must be specified when you manifest this power, and also must be aware to expect such a message from you in the first place in order to receive it.
##### **Déjà vu**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 30m

You create a brief memory loop in the mind of the target, causing their thoughts to slip back several seconds in time. You must be able to see the target and they must be within the range of the power to be affected. They are also permitted a Willpower Test to resist its effects. If they fail to resist, however, they must repeat the same Action that they took last Round in their next Turn, be it firing a gun at a target that is no longer there, continuing to run from a slain enemy, or diving for cover from a grenade that has already gone off. If the repeated Action would obviously be immediately harmful to the target, such as jumping into a flaming wreck they just escaped or replacing a fresh rebreather canister with an empty one in a room full of poison gas, the target automatically snaps out of it and stops themselves at the last moment.
##### **Disintegrating Directive**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Touch

You can cause a small object to spontaneously disintegrate under a specific set of circumstances. The object must be able to fit easily in your palm—a folded or rolled up piece of paper would work, but a pistol, even a small one, would not. You must specify the circumstances under which you wish the item to disintegrate when you manifest the power. For example, you might cause a letter to vaporise after being read, or a micro-bead to destruct after receiving a certain message. Once activated, the object crumbles into an indistinct mound of dust with a harsh acrid smell but little else to indicate what it might have been before.

This power's ability to affect objects is fickle and easily disrupted. The item must be in your sole possession and held in your hand as you make the Focus Power Action to manifest the power. The object cannot be connected to a larger mechanism or device when you use this power, and the power's effect ends if the object is installed or attached in anything larger or more complex. You could manifest this power on a single bullet or a tiny cog, but the power will end if the bullet is loaded into a clip or the cog is installed in a mechanism.
##### **Distort Vision**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Free Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

With this power your physical form distorts and you almost fade from view. Your precise location becomes extremely difficult to discern, and until the start of your next Turn all attacks against you suffer a –30 penalty to hit. Characters with the [Blind Fighting](talents.md#blind%20fighting) Talent only suffer –10 penalty. A character with the Psyniscience Skill can determine your true location and negate this penalty entirely with a successful Psyniscience Test.

Sensory equipment that uses typical optical sensors, such as pict–recorders or vid–stealers, are fooled by this power; ones that read thermal patterns, use motion trackers, or rely on some other form of detection are not. Creatures and sensors that do not rely on sight are not affected by this power at all.
##### **Distortion**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** Touch (You)

You can make the features and voice of the subject into a shifting, unrecognisable distortion of its true nature, a disturbing sequence of random faces and voices. Those interacting with the subject will be totally unable to recognise them, and depending on how the subject is dressed, may not be able to determine their gender either. This power is extraordinarily effective at concealing the subject's identity, but the obvious visual and auditory disruption is clearly unnatural and could be a cause for alarm by those who witness it.
##### **Distract**
**Threshold:** 5
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 20m

You can inflict a momentary inattention in another, causing them to glance to one side, scratch an itch, experience a facial tic, or some other trivial annoyance that nevertheless hinders their awareness. The subject suffers a –20 penalty to Perception-based Tests on their next Turn. If the target is aware of your presence (e.g. if you were engaging them in conversation or tiptoeing across their peripheral vision) they are entitled to an **Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test** to resist this power's effects.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the duration of the distraction by one additional Turn.
##### **Dull Pain**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

You can reduce or eliminate the physical aches and pains of any creature, including yourself, within Range. The target of this power reduces their levels of Fatigue by one step. This power does not heal any injuries, but can alleviate the target's suffering, which may aid in their treatment (and could also improve the target's opinion of you!). More basically, it can also be used to restore vigour to those stricken with exhaustion. 

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you remove an additional level of Fatigue.
##### **Endure Flames**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You can endure the most severe flames, allowing you to walk unscathed through fire. You are immune to Damage from fire and Flame weaponry and reduce the Damage inflicted on you by Plasma or Melta type weapons by half before reduction for Armour and Toughness Bonus. The effects of this power extend to your clothing and equipment. Note that while this power can guard you from the damaging effects of fire and extreme heat, it offers no protection from "secondary" consequences such as smoke inhalation, fire consuming all the air in a sealed compartment, or a burning building collapsing on your head.
##### **Fearful Aura**
**Threshold:** 7
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You twist reality in such a way as to make you appear more sinister and dangerous. You become the source of inexplicable yet profound dread for anyone who looks upon you. Whilst this power is active, you have a [Fear Rating of 2](fear%20and%20damnation.md#degrees%20of%20fear).

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, your Fear Rating increases by 1 to a maximum of 4.
##### **Flash Bang**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 20m

You create a bright flash of light and a deafening bang. Anyone within Range must succeed on a **Routine (+20) Willpower Test** or become Stunned for 1 Round.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, the Difficulty worsens by one step, from Routine (+20) to Ordinary (+10), from Ordinary (+10) to Challenging (+0), and so on.
##### **Float**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You focus your concentration and slowly begin to lift off the ground. You can only move up and down while under the effects of this power, and you cannot rise higher than 5 metres. You can use this power to stop yourself from falling, but you must succeed on a **Difficult (–10) Willpower Test** in addition to beating the PT to successfully arrest your fall.
##### **Forget Me**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

You become instantly forgettable to a single creature within Range. They can't seem to recall having met you before this very instant, and you effectively suppress all memories of your previous encounters too. The target is entitled to an **Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test** to resist this power. Their memory returns after 1d10 minutes.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may do any of the following: extend the effects of this power to either one additional target, add an extra 1d10 minutes to the duration, or worsen the Difficulty of the Willpower Test by one step.
##### **Haywire**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 25m

You focus disruptive energies into the heart of an electro–technic device, such as a vox-caster, motion detector, or even a lasgun, causing it to temporarily malfunction and become inoperable for one Round. Beings with mechanical or cybernetic elements, such as servitors or Tech-Priests, can negate the effect with a successful Willpower Test. With failure, a heavily augmented creature becomes Stunned for one Round, while a being with fewer cybernetics simply loses the use of them for the same.

This power is utterly despised by members of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and you would do well to avoid using it in their presence.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you affect one additional target within range.
##### **Healer**
**Threshold:** 7
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

You channel your power into a single target to knit flesh and mend bones. You may only use this power on a willing target, including yourself. The target of this power removes 1d5 points of Damage (removing Critical Damage first) as their wounds visibly close and new warp-spawned blood flows in their veins.

Repeated uses of this power can be dangerous, however, not to mention painful, and the person's flesh rebels against the intrusion of warp energy. If a person (including the Psyker) is the subject of this power more than once in a 6 hour period, they must Test Toughness or take 1d5 points of Damage (with no reduction for Toughness Bonus or Armour), rather than being healed.
##### **Inflict Pain**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 100m

You cause a person to believe they're being afflicted with intense, debilitating pain. The target is entitled to a Willpower Test to resist the effects of this power. On a failed Test, the target suffers a –10 penalty to all Tests as they are thoroughly distracted by any number of painful sensations. This power has no effect on unliving matter or targets incapable of feeling pain.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold you can extend the effects of this power to affect another target.
##### **Inspiring Aura**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You seem to glow with an inner light and all those around you are filled with confidence. While this power is active, all allies that can see you gain a +20 bonus to Tests made to resist Fear and Pinning. They may also feel compelled to say nice things about you, which is nice.
##### **Knack**
**Threshold:** 7
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You tap into your unconscious to awaken a deeper understanding of your capabilities. Until the end of your next Turn, you may gain a +10 bonus to any one non-combat Test. After this point, your enlightened mood fades.
##### **Lucky**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

It is said that luck acts strangely around Psykers, no doubt in part to powers like this one. When you manifest this power, any time before the end of your next Turn, you may re-roll any one roll of your dice. This is not limited only to Tests—you may re-roll Damage from your attacks, Power Rolls, Wounds recovered by spending a Fate Point, or any other dice roll made by you.
##### **Mutable Features**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

So long as an individual’s looks and facial features are well known to you, you can alter the visual perception of those around you, making them see you as that individual. Those observing you must make a Willpower Test to see through the deception. This power only allows you to impersonate a specific individual, so you may not "create" a nonexistent person in your mind to take on their appearance. It does not affect your gear, equipment, or clothing, nor does it change your voice or speaking mannerisms to match the target's—such deception is achieved with the [Disguise Skill](skills.md#disguise).

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, the difficulty of the Willpower Test increases by one level, from Challenging (+0) to Difficult (–10) and so on.
##### **Open Wounds**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

You can cause a previously injured victim’s wounds to burst open and gush with blood, rapidly exsanguinating them in an extremely messy fashion. The victim must pass a **Difficult (–10) Toughness Test** or suffer 1d5 Rending Damage which is not reduced by Toughness Bonus or Armour. This Damage is applied to the victim's most recently wounded Location. Additionally, if the
target is Heavily Wounded, it immediately suffers [Blood Loss](injury%20and%20healing.md#blood%20loss) as well. This power has no effect against an unwounded or unliving target, or one whose specific constitution renders it immune to the effects of Blood Loss.
##### **Precognition**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You get a fuzzy picture of what will occur a few moments into the future. As you draw nearer to the event, the picture becomes clearer. For as long as this power is active, you gain a +10 bonus to Dodge Tests and to Weapon Skill Tests made to Parry incoming blows.
##### **Psychic Stench**
**Threshold:** 5
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Touch

By momentarily handling an item in your possession you imbue it with an unnatural and unpleasant psychic smell. Anyone coming within five metres of the tainted item will smell it, regardless of barriers or other smells present. What a person smells when around an item affected by Psychic Stench depends on what they find most distasteful or upsetting, so the aroma can vary greatly from person to person. As the smell only exists in a person's mind, it will also affect creatures that do not have a sense of smell or have had their sense of smell impaired. Psychic stench remains in effect for 1d10 days, after which time it dissipates.
##### **Resist Possession**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Reaction
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

You create mental wards to shield your mind from the malign denizens of the warp. Any time in the next hour you may re-roll any failed Test to resist being possessed by a Daemon.
##### **Sense Mechanism**
**Threshold:** 7
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 50m

By extending your vision into the warp and perceiving the shadows of the physical universe, you can sense machinery and constructs within the area. This does not grant you knowledge of their function, only their approximate form and general location. The presence of living beings blocks the line of sight beyond them, as they possess a far brighter presence in the warp than physical objects do. Walls in excess of 1 metre thick block this power.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by an additional 10 metres.
##### **Sense Presence**
**Threshold:** 7
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 50m

Reaching out with your mind, you get a vague inkling of other life forms within range. You automatically detect all living creatures in the area. You are aware of the direction of each life form, but not their exact distance or location. You can distinguish between different size categories (i.e. Miniscule, Average, or Enormous) but you cannot determine the exact species or race. Walls in excess of 1 metre thick block this power.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by an additional 10 metres.
##### **Space Slip**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

You push yourself through the edge of the warp, slipping out of reality for a brief instant and reappearing in a different nearby location. A powerful trick, but dangerous and unpredictable in its effect. This power can be immensely useful in evading pursuit or getting the drop on an opponent, but can seriously injure or cripple a psyker who runs afoul of the warp's fickle nature.

First, decide if you wish to slip a short distance (1d5 metres) or a long distance (1d10+2 metres), then make a Power Roll as normal. If this power is successfully manifested, you are immediately moved to a point either 1d5 or 1d10+2 metres away from your starting location, based on your earlier choice of a short or long distance slip. You move in a direction of your choice without regards to any intervening material or physical obstructions, but you may not bypass warded barriers, void shields, Gellar fields, or similar psychoactive impediments.

If the use of this power means that you would appear inside solid matter, you must Test Toughness or risk suffering grievous injury. If this Test is successful, you are thrown backwards 1d5 metres away from the offending object and are Stunned for 1d5 Rounds, but are otherwise unharmed. If this Test is failed, you are still hurled back and Stunned as previously described, but also suffer 1d10 Explosive Damage (treat this as a hit to the Body Location), plus another 1d10 for each degree of failure (if any). This Damage is which not reduced by Toughness Bonus or Armour. If the solid object encountered is another living creature, it too must pass a Toughness Test or become Stunned for 1d5 Rounds, although it will not suffer any Damage if it fails.
##### **Spasm**
**Threshold:** 7
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 50m

You cause a target's muscles to spasm. The target is entitled to a Willpower Test to resist this power. On a failure, the target twitches in an uncontrollable and possibly amusing way. If the target is wielding a loaded gun of any kind the weapon goes off—make a Ballistic Skill Test as normal to hit the closest creature. In addition, the target immediately [falls to the ground](combat.md#prone).

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may either affect an additional target or worsen the Difficulty of the Willpower Test by one step.
##### **Spectral Hands**
**Threshold:** 10
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 30m

You create an invisible force that you can use to manipulate any object within 30 metres. The force has a Strength Characteristic equal to your Willpower. This power lasts until the end of your next Turn. You can use it to knock over objects, push buttons, pull levers, hold a door shut, or do any number of other things requiring force. This force is notoriously vague and imprecise, however, and you cannot perform any action that requires any sort of manual dexterity, such as typing on a dataslate, pulling the pin from a grenade or the trigger of a gun, and so on. In addition, Spectral Hands has no effect on living targets—you could tip a heavy object onto an enemy, but could not push the same enemy out a window.
##### **Staunch Bleeding**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

A true gift of the Scholastica Medicae, this power immediately ends [Blood Loss](injury%20and%20healing.md#blood%20loss), knitting together severed veins and coagulating rent wounds. You may use this power on yourself or another creature within Range.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may affect another target.
##### **Suggestion**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 6m

A weak form of telepathy, you introduce a single suggestive thought into a target’s psyche, making him more open to a certain line of thinking, experience a brief sensation, lend credence to what you are saying, or momentarily experience an emotional state of your choosing.

Make an Opposed Willpower Test against the target. If you win, you can introduce a suggestion into the target’s mind. If the target wins, or you fail the Willpower Test, the power ends, and further attempts to use Suggestion on the same target grant the target a +20 bonus to his Willpower Test to resist it. Additionally, the target may feel inexplicably suspicious of you for some time afterwards.

Far from true mind control, this power is a subtle manipulation of the victim’s perception and attitudes. You could, for example, convince a target that he likes you, that he is hungry, that he’s seen your identity card, or that what you say is likely to be true, or create a sudden feeling that there is a vermin crawling up a guard’s back. You could not, however, get him to perform specific actions that are entirely out of character, believe things that are obviously implausible, change his fundamental beliefs, or otherwise harm himself.

Suggestion can be a powerful tool for manipulation when used in conjunction with an Interaction Skill to create a more favourable state of mind in the person you are attempting to influence. For example, you could impart a nondescript sense of dread into an informant you were questioning, or a vague memory that a clerk had seen you in the company of his master before whilst trying to talk your way inside. If the suggestion is directly relevant towards the Interaction Skill you're attempting to use on the target you gain a +20 bonus on the relevant Skill Test.
##### **Time Fade**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

You remove yourself from the normal flow of space and time for a few moments, flickering briefly out of existence like a failing holo-lantern slide. After this power has been manifested you simply cease to exist, popping back into existence in exactly the same spot 1d5 Rounds later. If this location is now occupied, a repulsion effect occurs identical to the [Space Slip](PSYCHIC%20POWERS.md#space%20slip) power. This transition is instantaneous for you regardless of how many Rounds you spent in a state of nonexistence, so any ongoing effects, such as Blood Loss or any drugs you have taken, do not progress until you return to reality.

Although the temporal incontinence you experience occurs instantly it can still have a profoundly disturbing and dislocating effect on you when time appears to jump ahead. When you return to existence you must Test Willpower or become Stunned for one Round. If this Test is failed by more than three degrees, you must roll on the **[Shock Table](fear%20and%20damnation.md#failing%20the%20fear%20test)** as if this had been a failed Fear Test.
##### **Torch**
**Threshold:** 5
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

By burning the very stuff of your thoughts, you create a ball of glowing psy-flame. The light cast by Torch is equivalent to a common glow-lamp, providing light in a 10 metre radius. The flame may issue from any point on your body. The flame is roughly the size of your palm, and pulses slightly in time with your heartbeat. It may be coloured according to your whim. The light produces no heat, so it cannot be used to ignite flammable objects or inflict Damage.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold you may double or halve the size of the light, or cause it to float up to one metre from your body in any direction. 
##### **Touch of Madness**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 100m

You reach into the mind of a target within Range and force them to momentarily experience images of utter insanity. The target is entitled to a Willpower Test to resist this power. On a failed Test, the target is stricken by the horrible visions you have visited upon them and must roll 1d100 on the **[Mental Traumas Table](fear%20and%20damnation.md#only%20the%20insane%20shall%20prosper)** to determine how profoundly it affects them.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you affect an additional target.
##### **Trick**
**Threshold:** 5
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You subtly influence the fields of probability flowing around you, making you especially good at cheating at games of chance. If you do not have the Gamble Skill, you gain it at two levels of mastery (e.g. you may make Gamble Tests at a +10 bonus) for as long as the power is sustained. If you are trained in Gamble, you gain an additional +20 bonus to Gamble Tests. This power cannot grant you a cumulative bonus to Gamble greater than +30—if you already have already achieved that level of Skill Mastery in Gamble, this power has no effect: you are simply already "that good".
##### **Trusting Aura**
**Threshold:** 10
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

Using your existing knowledge of social graces and mores you draw forth power from the warp to discreetly make your persona seem more trustworthy and earnest than it really is. Those around you are more naturally inclined to believe what you say, see your arguments as more reasonable, and trust that your threats are very real. While sustaining this power you gain a +10 bonus to all Interaction Skills you are trained in.

**Overbleed:** If you exceed the Threshold by 10 points, the bonus increases to +20.
##### **Truth-Seeker**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** Touch (see text)

This power makes it very difficult for others to knowingly lie to you. You must prominently place a hand somewhere on the target's body and maintain that physical contact with them as long as you wish to impede their ability to utter falsehoods. While you sustain this power, and keep a hand on them, the target must pass a Willpower Test in order to consciously lie to you. If the target fails they find an inexplicable force simply prevents them from lying, although they can certainly still attempt to change the subject or otherwise evade the topic, including by remaining silent. Note that the target must be aware of their lying for this power to work—it has no effect on a target that is simply misinformed or ignorant about the truth of what they speak.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold the Difficulty of the Willpower Test to lie to you increases by one step, from Challenging (+0) to Difficult (–10), from Difficult (–10) to Hard (–20), to a maximum of Very Hard (–30).
##### **Unnatural Aim**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

Your awareness of the warp's eddies and flows grants you momentary insight into the future. While insufficient for any kind of true precognition, it does give you just enough foresight to help your bullets and bolts strike true. Until the end of your next Turn you gain a +30 bonus to all Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack.
##### **Wall Walk**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You bend gravity to your will. You negate all penalties incurred by low- or high-gravity worlds. In addition, you can walk on walls or ceilings for as long as this power is active. You move across such surfaces at half your normal rate. You must also Test Agility to go between a wall and ceiling and vice versa, unless you take a Full Action to ease yourself onto the new surface.
##### **Warp Howl**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 50m

You send out a long, keening screech throughout the warp that tears through into reality in a cacophonous burst. This sonic abomination drowns out all sound within Range for one Round, during which time any Skill or Characteristic Tests that rely on hearing automatically fail and verbal communication is impossible.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by 10 metres.
##### **Weaken Veil**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 30m

You draw forth the anarchic energy of the warp, not to fuel a psychic effect, but to perilously thin the barrier between reality and the immaterium itself. The abundance of raw power so close significantly empowers any psykers in the area, but also increases the chances of a psychic mishap as the warp's roiling malignancies strain to break through. Anyone within Range that uses Psychic Powers gains a +2 bonus on all Power Rolls, but Psychic Phenomena now occur on the roll of an 8, 9 or 10.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by an additional 10 metres.
##### **Weapon Jinx**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 50m

You reach into a nearby weapon with your mind to disrupt its function. Any one ranged weapon within Range that is not in the Primitive weapon category instantly Jams. The jam is of a mundane nature and [can be cleared as normal](combat.md#weapon%20jams). Note that the Adeptus Mechanicus are especially loathing of this kind of ability and tend to take a very dim view of Psykers that employ it.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 10 metres, or you can affect an additional weapon. If you exceed the Threshold by 10 points or more, all mechanical devices within Range cease to function for one Round. Note that this may have undesired consequences in certain situations (e.g. ship's bridges, industrial forges, and so forth).
##### **White Noise**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 10m

You fill the warp with unnatural static, fouling psychic detection and making technological sensors, such as screamers and pict-stealers, less reliable. While active, any Tests made to detect your presence, as well as that of anyone within range of you, using either psychic or technological means, count as Hard (–20). If the means of detection would not normally require a Test, the user must make an **Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test** if using psychic means, or an **Ordinary (+10) Intelligence Test** if they are using technological means.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 10 metres.
##### **Wither**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 3d10m

You cause a vile wave of invisible pestilence to emerge from your body, extending out to the Range of the power. The wave withers all normal plant life in the area in a matter of moments, leaving the area barren and utterly dead.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 1d10 metres.
##### **Without a Trace**
**Threshold:** 6
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You leave no tracks or evidence of your passage, including technological systems such as pict-recordings or other data stores. This does not mean that your presence cannot be seen or detected at the present time, and you trigger alarms or pitfalls normally.
