Biomancers specialise in manipulating biological energy and processes with the power of their minds. They are masters of the flesh, learning to shape and direct their bodies according to their wills—and sometimes those of their allies, or enemies, too. More skilled Novices come to possess nearly complete control over the very forces of life and death itself, able to heal any wound, cure any disease, and even stave off the inevitable decay of age. 

A few biomancers use their powers for altruistic purposes, benevolently providing succour to those suffering from injury and ailment or lending their abilities to further the knowledge of the human form. Most, however, become conceited and egoistic souls, partaking in hedonistic frivolities and impetuous ventures with little regard for consequence—after all, there are vanishingly few repercussions of the flesh a skilled biomancer can't "fix".

##### **Agony**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 10m

Reaching out with your mind, you viciously upset the bioelectrical rhythms of your enemies to inflict acute and all-consuming pain on them. The target must successfully Test Toughness at the beginning of its Turn or be so overcome that it may only take a Half Action that Round. If the target fails by more than three degrees the target is completely overwhelmed by the hideous pain and may take no Actions that Round while also gaining one level of Fatigue. This power has no effect on unliving matter or targets incapable of feeling pain.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which the Threshold is exceeded, a second target within Range and line of sight may be affected.
##### **Bio-Lightning**
**Threshold:** 14
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

Drawing on and enhancing the natural electrical currents of your nervous system, you summon
a crackling bolt of living power to shock your enemies. You may direct this energy against a single target within Range. The target takes 1d10 plus your Toughness Bonus in Energy Damage with the Shocking quality and Penetration equal to your Psy Rating.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 10 metres. For every 10 points that you exceed the Threshold, you can launch another bolt of energy against the same or a different target, or deal an additional 1d10 points of Damage (your choice).
##### **Blood Boil**
**Threshold:** 19
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 10m

With a rhythmic crushing gesture, you tune into an enemy's vital humours, flexing their heart muscles to accelerate their pulse. This continues until their blood pressure reaches lethal levels. As you continue to exert your will, blood vessels begin to rupture, causing haemorrhaging across the target's body. Each Round (including the Round in which the power manifests), you may spend a Half Action to make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against your target's Toughness. If you win the Test, your opponent gains one level of Fatigue, plus one additional level of Fatigue per degree of success, until he collapses unconscious. Each level of Fatigue beyond those that the target can take deals 5 Damage instead, which is not reduced by Toughness Bonus or Armour. Should Damage equal the target's Wounds, instead of suffering Critical Damage their heart and brain explodes, killing them instantly as blood rapidly escapes all of their orifices.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you gain a +10 bonus on your Opposed Willpower Tests.
##### **Cellular Control**
**Threshold:** 16
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

Through meditating upon the meridians of your body and accelerating your vital humours you gain the ability to manipulate, control, and even alter your own cellular structure in various inventive ways. This power enables you to achieve any one of the following effects:

* Gain immunity to all poisons. This also immediately ends the effects of any poison you might already be suffering from.
* Ignore the effects of extreme environmental heat or cold. This does not heal you of any Damage or Fatigue you may have already suffered due to the environment, but does prevent you from gaining any more while it is active. Fire and weapons that inflict Energy Damage still affect you normally.
* Increase your Strength, Toughness, or Agility Characteristic by +10. This effect notably alters your appearance while this power is active—increasing your Strength causes your muscles to visibly swell, increasing your Toughness noticeably hardens your skin, and increasing your Agility causes your limbs and joints to become grotesquely flexible.
* Gain immunity to the effects of Fatigue, including the –10 penalty to Tests and falling unconscious. This does not actually remove any levels of Fatigue you may have gained, so you will still suffer their effects when this power ends.
* Gain immunity to the effects of [vacuum exposure](injury%20and%20healing.md#vacuum). You will still begin to suffocate if you don't have some sort of air supply, however. 
* You may hold your breath for a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus. You must begin holding your breath when you manifest the power to gain this benefit—if your lungs are already full of smoke, water, or poison gas, holding your breath for longer will not help you!
* Gain the [Sprint Talent](talents.md#sprint). If you have a running start, you also gain an additional +20 bonus to Tests made to [jump or leap](movement.md#jumping%20and%20leaping).

Radically altering your physiology with this power can exact quite a toll on your body. As you sustain this power you must make a Toughness Test after a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus, in addition to making the usual Power Roll every 10 Rounds. Failure causes you to suffer 1d10 Rending Damage, which is not reduced by Armour, as your body begins to break down under effects it was never meant to sustain. If you suffer any Damage, after reduction for Toughness Bonus, you must also make a Willpower Test—if you fail, the power ends immediately, your mind involuntarily severing the connection to the warp to try and preserve your body from further harm. You must continue to make Toughness Tests at this same interval as long as you sustain this power.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold you gain an additional effect of your choice.
##### **Constrict**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

With a word or gesture you can command the flesh of your target to sharply contract. The target's windpipe closes, choking them and causing them to begin [Suffocating](injury%20and%20healing.md#suffocation). Each Round, the target must make an Opposed Willpower Test with you. This is a Free Action for both you and your target. If they succeed, they may act normally (though they are still subject to the Suffocating effect). If you succeed, the target must spend a Full Action to Test Toughness.  On a success, they regain control over their body and clear their windpipe. On a failure they continue to suffocate. The target is considered to be engaged in strenuous activity.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, the Difficulty of the Toughness Test worsens by one step.
##### **Drain Vigour**
**Threshold:** 20
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 20m

You drain the very essence of a living creature, sapping its vitality and strength, and ultimately incapacitating or even killing it. The target must pass a **Difficult (–10) Willpower** **Test** or its Strength, Toughness, and Agility Characteristics are all reduced by 1d10 (roll once for all characteristics). In addition, if the victim fails the Willpower Test, it must Test again in the following Round, risking further Characteristic Damage. Assuming you sustain the power, this process continues until it passes a Willpower Test or dies when its Toughness is reduced to zero. The Characteristic Damage recovers fully 1d10 Rounds after you stop sustaining the power. This power has no effect on unliving matter.
##### **Enhance Senses**
**Threshold:** 10
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

With a moment's thought you gain senses more fitting a beast than a man, the sense organ involved becoming strained or reacting unnaturally as its capabilities are pushed beyond human limits. When you manifest this power, choose one of your five senses and gain the appropriate [Heightened Senses Talent](talents.md#heightened%20senses) for it. If you already have Heightened Senses for that sense, the bonus to Tests increases to +20. Additionally, each sense has some additional effects:

* **Sight:** Your eyes grow hugely dilated and bulge disquietingly. You can see clearly even in areas of dim light or shadow. You suffer no penalties and enemies gain no bonuses against you due to light unless you are in total darkness.
* **Smell:** Your nose drips mucus and twitches involuntarily like a vermin's. Your sense of smell is now sharp enough to track a target by scent alone. If you have an item belonging to the individual you are trying to track you gain a +20 bonus to Survival Tests made to track them.
* **Sound:** Your ears perk and wiggle like an animal's each time you hear something. You can hear sounds in frequencies above and below what human ears can normally perceive, such as infrasonic communication between servitors.
* **Taste:** You salivate heavily and compulsively lick your lips. Aside from making yourself an absolute epicurean critic, you can also make an Awareness Test to determine if any food or drink you taste has been poisoned or otherwise adulterated. With success you can spit out the tainted food or drink before the poison has a chance to affect you. 
* **Touch:** Your skin flushes and hairs stand up on end. You can "see" any object you hold merely by running your bare fingers over it, even in areas of total darkness, or if you don't look at the object in the first place. Your sense of touch is acute enough to even read handwritten script by feeling the ink on the parchment.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may enhance an additional sense.
##### **Iron Skin**
**Threshold:** 18
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You draw forth warp power to physically fortify your body against harm, making you both more resilient and more lethal in combat. Your skin darkens unnaturally as it takes on a hard, chitinous appearance, the flesh below thickens and your bones become dense as ceramite plates. As long as you sustain this power your Strength and Toughness Bonuses both increase by 2, but your Agility Bonus is reduced by 1 due to your carapace-like hide and rigid movements.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which the Threshold is exceeded, you gain an additional increase of +1 to your Strength or Toughness Bonus (your choice) for the duration of the power, up to a maximum of triple your normal Strength or Toughness Bonus. Note that if Overbleed increases your Strength or Toughness Bonus to double or greater than normal your Agility Bonus is further reduced by 1 on account of your body's ponderous bulk.
##### **Regenerate**
**Threshold:** 23
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** Touch (You)

The pinnacle of a biomancer's abilities, this power allows you to knit flesh back together at a phenomenal rate, not only healing the most grievous wounds but even regrowing lost limbs and destroyed organs. This is a grueling ability to master, requiring great psychic strength and intense mental focus, but the power to fully recuperate from just about any non-lethal injury is truly a remarkable one. 

Each Round this power is active you remove 1d5 points of Damage and levels of Fatigue, removing Critical Damage first. If you use this power on another character you must spend a Full Action each Round, keeping both hands on the target as you direct the warp's energies towards the target's injuries. Once all Damage is removed, you may begin to heal more immanent wounds and Critical Effects such as permanent Characteristic Damage, disfiguring injuries, lost limbs, and just about any other physical ailment.

Regrowing missing or ruined parts of anatomy is an involved process that takes more than a few minutes. You must sustain this power for one hour, making a Power Roll every ten minutes instead of the usual ten Rounds, during which time you may take no other Actions. If you are using this power on another character they may take no Actions either, and you must keep both hands on the target for the entire hour. If you manage to sustain the power long enough you implant a "seed" of warp energy in the target's body, which begins to heal permanent injuries over the course of the coming days. You need not sustain the power any longer—as long as the target rests, avoiding any strenuous activity, Regenerate continues to heal them.

Each day you heal one injury, such as a broken bone, blinded eyes, or burn-scarred skin. Permanent Characteristic Damage, penalties to Tests, and other disabilities caused by injuries are restored or healed at the same time as the injury is. Regrowing a missing limb or ruined organ, an awkward and uncomfortable process, takes significantly longer, requiring an uninterrupted week of rest. You cannot heal any injuries on any day in which you do not rest, and suffering any new Damage or Fatigue prematurely ends the power before you are fully healed. You choose the order in which multiple injuries are healed when the process begins, regardless of whether you use this power on yourself or another. Finally, Regenerate cannot regrow a body part that has been replaced with an augmetic, such as a bionic limb or cybernetic eyes—the augmetic must be removed first if you wish to restore your original flesh.

**Note:** While this power is capable of restoring even Characteristic Damage caused by ageing and disease, it does not remove Insanity or Corruption Points, and biomancers who believe they have found the secret of immortality often succumb to madness in the end.
##### **Shape Flesh**
**Threshold:** 19
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

Shape Flesh is the point where your flesh and will become indistinguishable—the goal of many a biomancer. Shape Flesh allows you to twist your physical frame in nearly any way you can imagine. The transformation is swift and grotesque, your body stretching or deforming like clay and new appendages erupting out of your flesh. When you manifest this power choose one of the following effects:

* Gain any one of the following Traits—Burrower (3), Crawler, Dark Sight, Flyer (4), Hoverer (4), Multiple Arms, Natural Armour (2), Natural Weapons, or Quadruped. Your altered form can appear as distorted or mutated human features, or a more bestial and monstrous profile, at your choice—regardless, it will always have an uncomfortably unnatural appearance to others. 
* Assume the appearance of any one creature. You may make Disguise Tests as if you had the Disguise Skill and at a +10 bonus. If you already have the Skill, you gain an additional +20 bonus. If you have access to the creature's genetic signature you can mimic that as well. 

Note that a radical change to your physiology may make it difficult or impossible to use some of your gear and equipment, and any new limbs you happen to grow could interfere—possibly quite badly—with your armour or clothing.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold you may gain an additional Trait, or increase the bonus to Disguise Tests by +5.
##### **Toxic Siphon**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Touch (You)

This power removes poisons and other toxins from the target’s body, albeit at a cost. You may only use this power on a willing target, including yourself. If you successfully manifest this power you are able to identify the locations of the toxins in the target’s body and swiftly remove them by uncontrolled vomiting, leaking from the eyes, leaching out of the skin, or by some other unpleasant, if quick, means. Regardless, the target must Test Toughness or be Stunned for 1d10 Rounds minus his Toughness Bonus. A result of zero indicates that he is inured enough to the discomfort or pain caused by this power and may act normally.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may draw poison from an additional target, who must be touching you or another person being purged by you.
##### **Unnatural Healing**
**Threshold:** 20
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

Through intuitive knowledge of the body and psychic might you can almost instantly heal your injuries or those of any other character within Range. Ragged lacerations fuse and cuts vanish as new flesh spontaneously fills wound channels. Broken bones set and cement themselves, burnt skin sloughs away as fresh tissue grows beneath, and fresh blood renders the target hearty and hale again. The target of this power removes 1d10 points of Damage, plus an amount of Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus, removing Critical Damage (if any) first and immediately ending [Blood Loss](injury%20and%20healing.md#blood%20loss). This power can remove certain Critical Effects, such as [broken bones and temporarily useless limbs](injury%20and%20healing.md#useless%20limbs), but cannot regrow missing body parts or restore permanent Characteristic Damage.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may achieve any of the following: extend the Range by 10 metres, target an additional character within Range, or remove an additional 1d10 plus your Willpower Bonus in Damage from the target.
