Pyromancy is the art of creating and controlling fire, a primordial force of creation and destruction. Students of this discipline are known as pyromancers or pyrokinetics. Less charitable souls, and some of those who've been on the receiving end of their abilities, frequently refer to them as "pyromaniacs", or more pejoratively, "firebugs". Many disdain the manipulation of fire as a crude and limited psychic discipline, beneath the notice of a true practitioner of the psyker's arts. After all, compared to the power of mind control and precognition, what good is serving as a human replacement for a flamer?

These beliefs are rooted in credulity and naivete. A skilled pyromancer is a terrifyingly powerful force in combat, able to precisely torch a foe just as easily as incinerating an entire building at once, all the while using their mastery of flame for defence and battlefield control. Although pyromancers have a reputation for crazed displays of power, most aren't any more unhinged than any other graduate of the Scholastica Psykana. Those that do indulge in maniac and wanton acts of destruction, however, well deserve every last gram of the scorn and dread that follows them.

**Note:** Any Pyromancy power that inflicts Damage [may also set the target on fire](injury%20and%20healing.md#fire).

##### **Blinding Flash**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 12m

You focus blazing mental energy into a single point within your mind before releasing it all in a burst of searing bright light, blinding anyone who sees you and is within Range. All those affected must make an Agility Test or be [Blinded](injury%20and%20healing.md#blinded) for a number of Rounds equal to 1d10 times your Psy Rating. Characters with appropriate protective gear, such as blast goggles, are immune to this power, as are any beings that don't have visual sensory organs in the first place. 

Note that you yourself are not inherently immune to this power, although you need only make an **Ordinary (+20) Agility Test** to avoid blinding yourself. Alternatively, you could simply close your eyes until the beginning of your next Turn, in which case you automatically succeed.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you extend the Range by 4 metres.
##### **Burning Fist**
**Threshold:** 10
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

With a few moments of intense concentration, flames slide around your hands and wreath them in flickering tongues as long as the power is sustained. The flames do not harm you or your clothing and armour, but will ignite any flammable objects you touch or gases in the air. Your [unarmed attacks](combat.md#unarmed%20combat) deal 1d10+Strength Bonus in Energy Damage, and no longer count as having the Primitive quality. Note that your Weapon Skill Tests are still **Hard (–20)** if you are attacking an opponent armed with a weapon, and do not inflict Fatigue on your target (although they may set the target on fire!). Any objects you carry in your hands, including weapons and gear, suffer the same Damage for one Round, after which the flames move to sheathe them just like your hands and may be held safely. While you sustain this power the flames shed light equivalent to a small glow globe, illuminating a radius of about five metres from you.

**Note:** This power behaves somewhat differently for the rare psyker who's experienced in hand-to-hand combat. With the [Unarmed Warrior Talent](talents.md#unarmed%20warrior%20(ascendant%20talent)) you no longer take a penalty to your Weapon Skill Tests to attack an armed opponent, and additionally may add half your Psy Rating (round down) in Damage to your unarmed attacks. Should you possess the [Unarmed Master Talent](talents.md#unarmed%20master%20(ascendant%20talent), you may add your full Psy Rating instead.
###### **Call Flame**
**Threshold:** 8
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

Often the first power learned in this discipline is to summon fire with only your will alone. This allows you to conjure a small flame, about the size and intensity of a burning torch, into your palm. This flame illuminates a 10 metre radius around you, and can be used to ignite flammable objects or gases as well as create ambient heat. As long as you hold the flame in your hand it does not harm you or your clothing or armour, but it will inflict 2 points of Energy Damage per Round to any objects you try to hold with that hand. While this power does have various utility usages (you will never again be unable to light a lho-stick for lack of an igniter!), the main purpose is to serve as the necessary catalyst for certain pyromantic powers which require an already existing source of fire to manifest.

**Note:** This power cannot be used to attack on its own, but if you have also manifested Burning Fist maintaining this power adds 2 additional points of Energy Damage to your unarmed attacks.
##### **Douse Flames**
**Threshold:** 16
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 5m × Willpower Bonus

It takes a potent mind to deny the natural tendency of flames to run out of control, but just as your grasp of pyromancy allows you to summon flames, so too can you banish them. Douse Flames allows you to instantly extinguish all fires within Range, as well as interfere with fire-based weapons such as flamers, causing their fuel to spray forth but refuse to ignite. Note that flamer-grade promethium and other substances that spontaneously ignite in the presence of oxygen will still come aflame when this power's effect ends, or as soon as the material is brought outside of Range. For example, this power could easily save the life of a fellow Acolyte who's been set ablaze by a flamer, but they would need to be thoroughly scrubbed down before this power ended to avoid bursting into flame again. An especially intense or powerful blaze might also reignite when the power ends if materials that had previously been on fire remain superheated enough.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by 5 metres.
##### **Fire Bolt**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 100m

Fire Bolt allows you to create bolts of flame with your mind and hurl them at your foes—a simple but highly effective method of attack. You can direct the bolt at any target you can see within Range. Make a Willpower Test to strike the target and resolve it just like you had used Ballistic Skill to shoot a gun. On a hit, the bolt deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which the Power Roll exceeds the Threshold, you generate an additional Fire Bolt, which can be directed at any targets within Range. Make a separate Willpower Test for each target. You may instead direct as many bolts as you like at a single target, in which case this attack is treated as a [Full Auto Burst for the purposes of attempting to evade it](combat.md#dodging%20auto-fire%20and%20area%20attacks).
##### **Fire Storm**
**Threshold:** 16
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 50m

You summon an intense conflagration from a single flame and hurl it through the air at your target. The resultant blast often ignites the air itself, burning everything within to cinders. There must be an existing fire within Range and which you have line of sight to, which immediately erupts into a spectacular fireball. The resultant Fire Storm deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage to all creatures and objects within a 6 metre radius.

If there is no source of fire available, or it's in an inopportune location, you can use Call Flame to create one. In this case, the fire created by Call Flame may be thrown at any target within Range. Make a Willpower Test to attack, with the flame exploding into the Fire Storm where it lands.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, your Fire Storm deals an additional 1d10 points of Damage.
##### **Holocaust**
**Threshold:** 23
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 6m

A powerful ability that few pyrokinetics are strong enough to wield, and fewer have the courage to use. Holocaust calls forth a raging white-hot firestorm ignited by your own soul—even Daemons and warp entities fear this power, as they are burned to ashes just as readily as mortals. The fires of Holocaust burn outward from you, dealing 1d10 Energy Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus to all creatures and objects in the area. This Damage ignores Toughness Bonus and Armour (including Daemonic Toughness), and continues for as long as you sustain this power. Such is Holocaust's raw destructive power that even you yourself are not immune to its effects, the power burning you from the inside out even as you immolate everything around you. When you manifest this power, and for each Round you sustain it, you take 1d10+1 Energy Damage. This ignores your Toughness Bonus and Armour, but unlike the victims around you, it does not risk setting you on fire. Wounds caused by Holocaust may not be healed by any Psychic Powers, as the warp itself seems to be repulsed by this power's hideous destructive aura. 

Those slain by Holocaust are killed forever, burned to dust along with all of their gear and equipment. If you happen to become a victim of this power, you may not burn a Fate Point to avoid death.
##### **Incinerate**
**Threshold:** 19
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 10m

One of the more difficult tricks of the pyromancer is the ability to call forth the inner flame
of another being, burning them up from within. You must focus closely on the target, stoking their soul-fires until they burn too hot for the body to contain and your victim self-immolates in a spectacular fashion (more mundanely, you could simply excite the target's molecules psychically until they generate enough energy to combust). 

You select a single target (this can be a living being or an inanimate object, such as a wall or a vehicle) within Range when you make your Power Roll. If successful the target takes 1d10+1 Energy Damage, ignoring Armour (but not Toughness Bonus). You must spend a Full Action each Round if you wish to sustain this power, expending all of your concentration to drive the inferno increasingly higher. Each Round you sustain the power the target suffers an additional 1d10 Energy Damage—2d10+1 on the second round, 3d10+1 on the third round, and so forth—up to a maximum Damage dice equal to your Psy Rating. 

The power to stoke a flame to such intensity that it can burn through even adamantine plate demands the pyromancer's complete and total attention. If you take any other Actions, even a Reaction, while sustaining this power the power immediately ends (although the target may well continue to burn afterwards anyway).
##### **Molten Man**
**Threshold:** 27
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No (see text)
**Range:** You

The ultimate ambition of the pyromancer, this power transcends your physical form into an avatar of pure energy—you become the very fire itself. This transformation into living flame is no simple feat, and only the most capable and learned could even attempt such a triumph of psychic might. Committing yourself to the form of the Molten Man results in the following effects:

* All equipment and weaponry you carry immediately bursts into flames, exploding in loud pops or falling to your feet as even metal deforms and runs to slag. This causes no Damage to you, the roaring inferno deflecting even detonating grenades away from your body. Even any augmetics you bear are consumed in the fire.
* You are completely immune to all Damage from fire and flame weapons, and suffer only half Damage (before reduction for Toughness Bonus) from plasma, las, and melta weapons. As a Molten Man you could even survive exposure to the core of an operating plasma reactor (although not for very long).
* Your body, no longer made up of flesh and bone, becomes extraordinarily resilient to things that would kill or cripple a mortal man. You gain the Stuff of Nightmares Trait and Unnatural Toughness (+4). Any weapon that strikes you in a melee attack has a 75% chance of being destroyed as if it had been Parried by a power weapon.
* The heat you radiate is so intense that all creatures and objects within 5 metres of you suffer 1d5 Energy Damage every Round, and you gain the Fear (2) Trait due to your fiery and inhuman appearance.
* You gain the Deadly Natural Weapons Trait, and your attacks now deal 1d10 plus your Strength Bonus and Psy Rating in Energy Damage with a Penetration of 5 and the Vicious quality.

Molten Man lasts for a number of Rounds equal to your Psy Rating, and cannot be voluntarily ceased earlier than that—this power fully commits you to the flame until it burns out. Once the power ends you swiftly revert to your normal form, suffering 1d5 levels of Fatigue from the sudden reversion to flesh and blood (most pyromancers describe this as a feeling of intense, deadly cold). As per the Stuff of Nightmares Trait you do not suffer any non-lethal Critical Effects you may have incurred, but you are still considered to have the same amount of Critical Damage for the purposes of healing and suffering further injuries.
##### **Sculpt Flame**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 5m × Willpower Bonus

Your mastery over the elemental forces of fire allow you to control the shape and intensity of any fires burning around you. Where most see a burning building or towering forest fire as a terror to flee from, you see plasticine awaiting your hands or a dancer in need of a partner. So long as you focus on them the flames respond to your every gesture. A successful use of this power allows you to do any of the following effects with an existing fire:

* Expand the area of a fire in any (or all) directions a number of metres up to your Psy Rating. If there is nothing to burn in this area, the fire remains there for one Round before returning to its original size. Otherwise, the combustibles catch fire and the fire continues to burn. Anyone caught in the fire as it expands must make an **Ordinary (+10) Agility Test** or catch fire.
* Shrink the area of a fire in any (or all) directions a number of metres up to your Psy Rating. This can extinguish the fire if it is shrunk to zero metres in size.
* Create animated shapes in the flames, such as people, creatures, or objects. The level of detail is vague but sufficient enough to pantomime various actions. This effect has its own Overbleed: if you exceed the PT by 5 points, you can create easily recognisable images. If you exceed by 10 points, you can create near lifelike figures, as if carved from flame.
* Send a gout of flame coursing through the air towards a target within Range. This attack is not precise enough to target an individual creature, but will ignite anything within a one metre by one metre area where it lands. If there is nothing to burn in this area, the fire remains there for one Round before going out. Anyone caught in this area when the fire lands must make an **Ordinary (+10) Agility Test** or catch fire.
* Cause the fire to either drastically increase in brightness, or spew choking smoke and ash. If you choose the former the area is immediately filled with bright light if it wasn't already, and in that case the fire becomes so bright that any creatures within 2d10 metres of the fire must make a **Routine (+20) Agility Test** or be [Blinded](injury%20and%20healing.md#blinded) for a number of Rounds equal to your Psy Rating. If you choose the latter an area within 2d10 metres of the fire in all directions counts as [being filled with smoke](injury%20and%20healing.md#suffocation) for 1d10 Rounds.

Each Round you sustain this power you may take a Half Action to choose a new effect or continue the previous one. 

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you can extend the power's Range by a number of metres equal to your Willpower Bonus.
##### **Wall of Fire**
**Threshold:** 17
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 60m

A blunt yet highly effective ability in the pyrokinetic's arsenal, this power allows you to place an immobile barrier of flame that lingers for as long as you will it. The wall is three metres high, one metre thick, and can be up to ten metres long for every point of your Willpower Bonus. The wall springs up from any source of open flame within Range, and must run in a single continuous line from that point of origin. You must have line of sight to the entire length of the wall when you manifest this power. The flames take a moment to spring up, and any creatures caught in the path of the line's eruption may attempt a **Routine (+20) Agility** or **Dodge Test** to get out of the way. All creatures and objects within the wall's path, or who attempt to cross it afterwards, suffer 1d10+5 Energy Damage, ignoring Armour. When you stop sustaining this power the wall persists for one additional Round before going out, although anything flammable set alight by it will continue to burn as normal.

You can see through the wall while it is active, but the intense flames distort your lines of sight, imposing a –20 penalty to Perception-based Tests and Ballistic Skill Tests made against anything on the other side of the wall from you. Most projectiles can pass through the wall, although grenades and missiles might prematurely detonate depending on the type.
