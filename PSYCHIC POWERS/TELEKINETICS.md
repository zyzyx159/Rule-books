The art of telekinesis is the translation of mental imperative into physical force. Telekines—practitioners of this Discipline—gather together emotion and mental strength, using powerful psychic energy to influence the motion of objects and defy the laws of physics. 

Telekines are notorious for their forceful personalities, which many consider a consequence of the high level of mental focus and the often sudden and abrupt release of psychic energy that telekinetic powers demand. Among other graduates of the Scholastica Psykana there is a popular, if highly erroneous, view of telekines as pallid and unfit individuals who substitute their psychic abilities for all matters of even rudimentary physical tasks. In truth only the most capable practitioners can manifest this level of telekinesis with any measure of reliability, and in any case few would expend the amount of mental effort needed for purely mundane purposes. Many telekines suffer from intense migraines, nose bleeds, and minor ruptures of blood vessels from the exceptional level of concentration some of their powers demand, and more than a few are stricken by anaemia and other haematological maladies over time.

**Note:** Any time in which you cause Psychic Phenomena or exceed a Power Threshold by 10 points or more when making a Power Roll you must make a **Routine (+20) Toughness Test** or gain one level of Fatigue as you suffer from a splitting headache or blood trying to escape from a facial orifice due to mental strain.

##### **Catch Projectiles**
**Threshold:** 16
**Focus Time:** Reaction
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 1m × Willpower Bonus

You can use your telekinetic abilities to catch incoming projectiles, halting them in the air before they have a chance to strike you or those around you. This power only works against physical missiles, such as bullets, bolts, and flying grenades—attacks from Energy weapons, such as lasguns and flamers, lack sufficient mass to be arrested by this power. This power is manifested using your Reaction for the Round, and until the end of your next Turn you can "catch" a number of projectiles equal to your Willpower Bonus. These need not be targeting you—any projectiles passing within Range may be affected, although you must be aware of the attack in order to stop them. Projectiles so affected immediately stop and hang in the air, remaining fixed in place before falling to the ground when the power ends. This renders most attacks harmless, although certain grenades and other explosive projectiles might still go off when they hit the ground.

Note that this power cannot stop very large or unwieldy projectiles, such as artillery shells or falling boulders, and has no effect against flying fragments created by explosive weapons such as frag grenades and missiles.
##### **Fling**
**Threshold:** 14
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

You can telekinetically lift an unattended object from the ground and hurl it through the air, a rudimentary power that is surprisingly effective in both combat and for utility purposes. You may lift up to 5 kilograms per point of your Willpower Bonus, and can throw the object a number of metres equal to your three times your Willpower Bonus. If you wish to strike an individual target make a Willpower Test as if you were making an attack—your target may attempt to avoid the attack normally. A typical solid object, such as a rockcrete block or iron beam, deals 1d10 Impact Damage plus 1 point per 5 kilograms of weight when it strikes your target. Other objects may inflict more or less Damage depending on their shape and composition, especially if they happen to be a grenade. This power cannot be used to make any sort of fine manipulation, only a forceful throw.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may lift an additional 5 kilograms per point of your Willpower Bonus.
##### **Force Barrage**
**Threshold:** 21
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m × Willpower Bonus

Once a telekine has mastered the Force Bolt those with an appetite for even greater destruction, and the necessary psychic talent to match, pursue proficiency of this power. This power functions exactly as Force Bolt, except your greater psychic strength allows you to create one bolt per point of your Willpower Bonus. You may fire every bolt when you manifest this power, making a separate Willpower Test for each target. You may instead direct as many bolts as you like at a single target, in which case this attack is treated as a [Full Auto Burst for the purposes of attempting to evade it](combat.md#dodging%20auto-fire%20and%20area%20attacks).

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you generate an additional bolt.
##### **Force Bolt**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m × Willpower Bonus

Often one of the first offensive powers learned by a telekine, Force Bolt gathers up your will and coalesces it into a fist-sized projectile of tangible force that you may then fire at your opponents with deadly velocity. Test Willpower to hit the target just as if you were making a ranged attack. If you succeed, your attack deals 1d10 Impact Damage +1 per point of your Willpower Bonus. The bolt has a ghostly, ephemeral appearance, but as it is your own destructive thoughts and righteous fury given physical form you do have some control over its looks. Common choices include a clenched fist, a leering skull, or the business end of a warhammer.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, your bolt deals 1 additional point of Impact Damage.
##### **Precision Telekinesis**
**Threshold:** 23
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 10m

A true master telekine does not just heft aloft large objects with clumsy force, but can indeed manipulate the world around them with their mind just as they would use their hands. Precision Telekinesis is the capstone of the telekine's studies, allowing you to perform any task you could ordinarily accomplish with your bare hands, such as operating complex controls, picking a pocket, wielding a weapon, or even grappling an adversary. These effects can occur anywhere within Range, meaning you may perform various actions without needing to be within arm's reach of the object in question, or indeed even touching it with your hands at all.

In any situation in which the task in question would require a Characteristic Test, such as Weapon Skill for swinging a sword at a foe or Agility as part of the Security Skill for picking a lock, substitute your Willpower instead of the normal Characteristic. Your Psy Rating substitutes for your Strength Bonus when using this power.
##### **Psychic Blade**
**Threshold:** 19
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

The sharpness of a telekine's mind puts any mortal blade to shame, and this power allows you to literally turn that psychic edge against your enemies with devastating effect. When you manifest this power a faintly glowing spectral blade appears in the air before you. Formed of your own psychic energy, this molecule-thick blade is propelled by your own will, shearing through flesh and armour with contemptuous ease. Nevertheless, it is a frightfully dangerous weapon to use, for any stray thoughts can misdirect it—possibly with tragically unfortunate effect.

You may strike with the Psychic Blade using your Willpower in place of Weapon Skill, inflicting 1d10 Rending Damage plus additional Damage equal to twice your Willpower Bonus, with Penetration equal to twice your Willpower Bonus as well. You do not actually hold this blade, so you do not require a free hand to wield it, but it is still necessary to gesture and move as you will the blade to cut down your foes. Do not add your Strength Bonus to this Damage, as the Psychic Blade is a tool of the mind more than the body. You cannot be disarmed of this weapon, nor can it be destroyed by weapons with the Power Field quality. Its near-total lack of mass means you cannot use it to Parry, however. 

While attacking with Psychic Blade an unmodified result of 95 to 00 indicates some distraction causes the power to go awry and you automatically strike a different target within melee range. If there are several targets around you the blade strikes the one that is most significant to your emotional state at that time. If there is no one within range other than your original opponent you strike yourself instead.
##### **Psychic Crush**
**Threshold:** 17
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

A purely brute force use of telekinesis, you summon great bands of psychic force into existence, wrapping them around your enemies and then violently crushing the life out of them. Once manifested, you may use this power against any target within Range. Make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against your opponent's Toughness. If you beat your opponent, you deal 1d10 Impact Damage plus 1 per point of your Willpower Bonus. For each degree of success, you deal an additional 2 points of Damage. This power is notoriously imprecise, and you cannot moderate its strength enough to use it to Grapple an opponent or help an ally up.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may extend the Range by 10 metres.
##### **Psychic Storm**
**Threshold:** 12
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 10m

You unleash a chaotic and uncontrolled wave of telekinetic force, raising a tumult of squalling winds from nowhere and causing all sorts of havoc. Small objects are toppled and tossed around, glass shatters, electrical contacts short out and spark, cogitators and other logis-controlled devices spit out gibberish, and any other number of confounding phenomena occur all around you from the explosion of telekinetic anarchy. More of a novelty or psychic "parlour trick" than a true weapon in the telekine's arsenal, the chaotic effects of this power can nevertheless make for an effective distraction. Everyone within Range suffers a –10 penalty to all Tests while the power is in effect. You exist within a small "eye" at the center of the storm and are not affected.
##### **Push**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

Effectively a telekinetic bludgeon, you gather a ball of psychic energy and direct it against any single target within Range. Make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against your target's Strength. If you beat your opponent the projectile unceremoniously clobbers them to the ground, the target ending up [Prone](combat.md#prone) as if they'd been tackled by a burly enforcer. For each degree of success, you also inflict one level of Fatigue on them as well. 

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may extend the Range by 10 metres or gain a +10 bonus to your Willpower Test.
##### **Telekinesis**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

Telekinesis is the fundamental ability of this discipline, and usually the first power a novice telekine learns. Basic in function, yet an immensely useful tool nonetheless, this allows you to lift unattended objects and move them around with your mind alone. You focus on a single object whose weight does not exceed 5 kilograms per point of your Willpower Bonus, and with little more than a gesture or stern glare, lift and move it around (including into your own hand if you so desire). The object must remain within Range at all times, and does not move fast enough to be used as a weapon on its own—although a clever telekine with a grenade could certainly cause some trouble. Once you "release" the object from Telekinesis it falls slowly to the ground.
##### **Telekinetic Shield**
**Threshold:** 19
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

You construct a barrier of psychic denial and defiance that deflects the attacks of your enemies as if it were a solid object. A gently shimmering wall of force appears in front of you, vibrating at a colour frequency of your choice. You (and your opponents) can see through it easily enough, but the shield's spectral force blocks incoming projectiles and blades. This functions as if you were behind [Cover](combat.md#cover) relative to any attacks you are aware of, and is considered to have Armour Points equal to your Psy Rating. This reduces the Damage of incoming attacks before your own Armour and Toughness Bonus, but each attack which inflicts Damage in excess of the shield's AP reduces its protective value by 1 point as the telekinetic force weakens. Once damaged the shield cannot be "repaired" and you must manifest this power again if you wish to restore its full protective value.

As the shield moves to protect you from incoming attacks it has no effect against an attack you are not aware of.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you increase the Armour Points of the shield's Cover value by 1.
