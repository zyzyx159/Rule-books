Telepaths are able to contact and, for some, control the minds of others. From outright mental domination to subtle tricks of perception, telepaths can mould and shape thoughts with little more than a whim. However, to be able to hear the minds of all those around them, to feel the overflowing emotions of other men and remain sane requires great discipline. Many telepaths develop a loathing for others as a result, while others lose sight of their own self, overwhelmed by quirks of personality and beliefs that lodge in their minds over many years of telepathic contact (see the **Closer Than Flesh** rule below). Only the most capable have the strength of will and certainty of belief to resist such fates.

The typical telepath is often a tragic soul. Many who embark on the study of this discipline have good intentions, using their powers to read the minds of cultists and recidivists to thwart their vile plots. Others undertake even more benign purposes, acting as counsellors between feuding parties and mediating disputes through minute acts of manipulation or drawing forth honest testimony. As they grow in skill, however, many telepaths become unable to completely shut out the constant low level chatter of other minds, consequently coming to despise crowds of people. Some find it all too easy to detect the foetid overspill of thought and emotion that oozes from their fellows, leaving them under no illusions about the nobility of man's soul. Over time, many of even the most altruistic telepaths tend towards misanthropic depression. Regrettably, the most powerful telepaths were often already that way, viewing other people's minds as nothing more than a cheap book to be callously rifled through and then tossed away.
#### **Closer Than Flesh**
Telepathy is an intimate act, more personal and affecting in some ways than any petty communion of the body. To slip into the consciousness of another is a disturbing and disorienting task, for no two minds are alike and there is no telling what a telepath may find within another's psyche. Unwilling targets of telepathic acts are apt to conceive of a deep loathing for the invading psyker, in some cases bordering on a psychopathic hatred for the telepath who has violated their most intimate reaches.

Aside from making enemies for himself, the telepath also risks a very literal form of mental contamination when he enters another person's mind. It is all too easy to take on the personality traits of another, or worse still, be infected by the depravity and iniquity lurking in the souls of the mad and the degenerate. Psykers who are promiscuous with their powers often find their original personalities much altered, or even completely eroded, by continuous contact with foreign minds. 

Worse than this loss of the self, however, is the fate of telepaths who stumble upon truly dark and corrupted souls. If a Psyker uses a telepathic power on a target who has twice his own Insanity or Corruption Points, he must make a Willpower Test. Should the psyker fail the Willpower Test, he involuntarily pulls some of the target's depravity into his own mind, gaining 1d10 Insanity or Corruption Points as appropriate. In the unfortunate event that the target has both Insanity and Corruption Points equal to or greater than the Psyker's own the Psyker must make a separate Willpower Test for each, gaining 1d10 Insanity and/or Corruption Points with failure. Should the Psyker gain enough Insanity or Corruption Points to develop a new Disorder or Malignancy, they end up with one of the same ones possessed by the target.

**Note:** Using a telepathic power on an alien or servant of the Dark Gods can be incredibly perilous. Depending on the nature of the inhuman target, it may be assumed to have twice the Psyker's Insanity and/or Corruption Points regardless of the Psyker's actual total.

##### **Beastmaster**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 8m

You may stretch out your thoughts to animals, becoming able to perceive their emotions and establish a very rudimentary form of communication. The relative simplicity of an animal's mind allows you to dominate them, bending the animal's will to your own. When you manifest this power, select one animal within Range. Each Round you sustain the power, you may spend a Reaction to give the animal a command. The command must be simple, such as "come", "guard", "flee", "heel", "attack" and so on. The animal follows the command to the best of its ability. If the animal feels threatened, or is ordered to act in a way that is not suited to its nature, it may make a Willpower Test to break your control. If it succeeds the animal may flee, attack you, or linger nearby to observe depending on how you've treated it until then.
##### **Compel**
**Threshold:** 17
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 8m

One of the most direct of all "psyker mind tricks", Compel allows you to force others into briefly acting against their own will. Compel is a highly versatile power, useful for both subtle and blatant effects. When you manifest this power, make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against the target's. If you succeed, the target must follow your command. The nature of the command must be simple and achievable within a single Round. Some examples include "flee", "attack that target", "open this door", and so on. If the command would result in an obviously suicidal act, the target gets a +20 bonus to its Willpower Test. This power can only force the target to perform physical actions. It cannot, for example, be used to make someone tell the truth or use a psychic power on your behalf.

How the target perceives being Compelled depends on how radical of a departure from their normal proclivities your order is. An adept who might ordinarily be inclined to run away from you may not even realise he's been forced to flee, while a mercenary whom you Compelled to blow away one of his own comrades will be very aware you've forced him to do something terrible. 

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you gain a +10 bonus on your Opposed Willpower Test.
##### **Dominate**
**Threshold:** 24
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 8m

One of the most infamous of all telepathic abilities, you reach out with your mind to forcefully and completely seize control of another's body. Make an Opposed Willpower Test against your target. If you succeed, you control your target's body as if it were an extension of yours. For as long as the power remains active, you may divide up your Actions in each Round between yourself and the Dominated target as you will. For example, on your Turn, you might spend a Half Action to fire your laspistol at an Ork, and then spend your other Half Action to control the Dominated target, firing his bolter at the same Ork. The Dominated target remains conscious throughout the entire ordeal and is fully aware you are effectively stealing their body from them. 

While you are controlling another character with this power you use the target's Characteristics to make Tests, but suffer a –10 penalty due to less than perfect control over their body and the disorienting effects of your consciousness jumping between their body and yours. Any action that could be deemed as suicidal grants the target a new Willpower Test to try and break your hold. The target may take no other Actions as long as you sustain this power, and if you do not take any Actions as them during a Round they simply stand in place, although in this case they are not considered [Helpless](combat.md#helpless%20targets). The power ends immediately if either you or the target move out of Range with each other. You may only take physical Actions while controlling the target's body—Dominate does not allow you to make the target reveal information that is unknown to you, manifest a psychic power, and so forth.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you gain a +10 bonus on your Opposed Willpower Test.
##### **Inspire**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 6m

You bolster the resolve of your comrades, subtly implanting images of great courage and masking various negative emotional stimuli. Buoyed by beatific feelings of glory and achievement, your allies swiftly shake off fear and doubt even when the odds seem impossible and terrifying adversaries loom before you. A number of targets equal to your Willpower Bonus immediately overcome the effects of [Pinning](combat.md#pinning) and [Fear](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear), and remain impervious to these effects for as long as they stay within Range and for as long as you sustain the power. Inspire is an especially favoured power by Psykers who have been seconded to Imperial Guard regiments, where timely use of this ability can turn a gaggle of frightened conscripts into invincible shock troops.
##### **Mind Scan**
**Threshold:** 23
**Focus Time:** Extended Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Touch

This staggeringly powerful ability is considered by many in the Inquisition to be the telepath's true forte. You slowly yet forcefully break into the mind of a single creature, unravelling the layers and defences within it to uncover thoughts and memories, both obvious and hidden. You must keep at least one hand on the target when you manifest this power, and the longer you maintain that contact the more deeply you are able to peel back the strata of the target's conscious. 

Using Mind Scan is a lengthy process, requiring five Rounds of sustained effort to fully breach the target's mental defences. This is considered an Extended Action, and the power immediately ends if you are interrupted in any way. During each of these Rounds you and your target both make Opposed Willpower Tests. If you succeed, you gain some insight of the target's mind, which becomes increasingly detailed the longer you carry on. Should the target succeed he jettisons you from his mind—you are unable to dig any deeper and the power ends. You do retain any knowledge you have already gained from the power's use up until that point.

Although it appears to be subtle, Mind Scan is anything but for the target, who can clearly perceive psychic fingers probing into the innermost regions of their mind. This is a deeply unsettling event that the target will almost certainly recognise as an attack, so it is best to use on a target that is restrained, drugged, or otherwise incapacitated. It is possible to attempt a "covert" use of Mind Scan, although you must be very delicate with the target and cannot bring the full force of your will to bear. If you accept a –10 penalty on your Willpower Tests the target gets a faint sense of unease, but is otherwise unaware that their mind is being probed. 

As Mind Scan is successfully maintained, you obtain the following information over the requisite five Rounds:
###### **Round 1—Contact**
You touch the outermost layer of the target's mind, learning basic information such as their name, mood, general health, [Degree of Madness](fear%20and%20damnation.md#gaining%20mental%20disorders), and so forth. 
###### **Round 2—Surface Thoughts**
You begin to investigate the thoughts which are uppermost in the target's mind, such as their opinion of you, immediate fears, conscious lies, and a single location, object, event or person which is significant to the target (such as a lover, personal hab block, treasured heirloom or cult initiation). It is not apparent why the significant thing is important—only the emotions associated with it. You are also made aware of their [Degree of Corruption](fear%20and%20damnation.md#corruption%20points).
###### **Round 3—Short Term Memory**
You may rifle through the target's memories over the previous twelve hours. You also uncover two further significant locations, objects, events or persons. Again, it is not apparent why the significant thing is important—only the key emotions associated with it. Finally, you dredge up routine behaviours from the target's mind (e.g. hab block entry codes, habitual paths to work, exchequer ident numerals, frequently used Skills and Talents, and so forth).
###### **Round 4—Subconscious**
You gain detailed understanding of why significant locations, objects, events or persons hold importance to the target, and how they relate to each other (assuming they do in the first place). The target's beliefs, motivations and personal goals are apparent to you, as are the target's immediate network of contacts. Complicated ciphers may be extracted from the target's mind, and you are aware of pivotal moments in the target's life.
###### **Round 5—Soul Baring**
The last layer of the target's mind is pulled aside and you may plunder their mind at will. Any information contained within the target's psyche is an open book for you to thumb through in search of the answers you seek. You can also identify implanted memories or personalities, such as if the target has been mind cleansed or had their memories otherwise manipulated through psychic or technological means.
###### **Psychic Shriek**
**Threshold:** 18
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 10m

A voice's volume is limited to the realities of vocal capacity and a listener's ability to hear. Minds have no such limitations, and the mind of a telepath is an exceptionally powerful one at that. With this power, you gather your will and then release it as a blast of screaming mental energy that overloads the nervous systems of living beings, possibly knocking them unconscious. All creatures within Range that you specify must succeed on a Willpower Test or suffer a number of levels of Fatigue equal to your Willpower Bonus.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may extend the Range by 10 metres.
##### **See Me Not**
**Threshold:** 14
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 20m

You erase your presence from the minds of others. This power is far more than mere "invisibility"; targets that have fallen under the effect of this power cannot perceive you at all. While they may suspect that someone else is present, they can only react to the effects of what you do. For example, you could punch an adversary, and while that foe would know that he had been hit by "something", likely doing his best to find the source of the attack, he would look right through you while he was searching.

Upon manifesting this power, select a number of targets within Range equal to your Willpower Bonus. Each target must succeed on a Willpower Test or they can no longer perceive you for as long as you sustain the power. Any targets that move out of Range can abruptly perceive you again, and are no longer affected even if they move back within Range again. Should an affected target be able to deduce your approximate location—for example, using an auspex or being given instructions by an unaffected target—any attacks they would make against you suffer a –30 penalty, while you gain a +20 bonus to all attacks made against them.

Oddly, this power has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence of 10 or less, so many beasts and servitors will still perceive you normally. 

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may affect an additional target.
##### **Seed Mind**
**Threshold:** 26
**Focus Time:** Extended Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Touch

This power allows you to subvert the minds of others by planting a tiny seed of influence within a person’s mind; a psychic keyhole that you can use in the future to unlock their mental defences and enslave their will to your own. When you manifest this power make an Opposed Willpower Test against your target as you seek a suitable part of their psyche to seed. Each Round you and your target continue to make Opposed Willpower Tests until one of you achieves five cumulative degrees of success. You must keep at least one hand on the target throughout the entire process, and if you are interrupted for any reason the power ends and you must manifest it again to make a second attempt. The target is acutely aware you are attempting to install your own private door in their mind and will almost certainly attempt to resist your efforts, so it is advisable to use on a target who has been restrained or is unconscious.

If you achieve five degrees of success against the target your seed successfully "takes" in the target's mind, permanently granting you a great measure of psychic influence over them. From now on any time you successfully manifest [Compel](telepathy.md#compel), [Dominate](telepathy.md#dominate), [Suggestion](psychic%20powers.md#suggestion), or [Zone of Compulsion](telepathy.md#zone%20of%20compulsion) against the target their Willpower Test to resist you automatically fails—you simply invite yourself into their mind and direct their will as you desire. On the other hand, should the target achieve five degrees of success against you, they are able to harden their psyche against your efforts to seed it, and are henceforth immune to any further uses of this power by you.

Once a target's mind has been seeded by this power it is impossible for the target to remove it themselves. Another telepath who becomes aware of the seed, such as through the use of Mind Scan, may use Seed Mind on the target to free them of your seed instead of implanting their own.
##### **Soul Killer**
**Threshold:** 25
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 5m × Willpower Bonus

Telepathy is often thought of as a subtle and delusory discipline by many graduates of the Scholastica Psykana, its emphasis on more perfidious acts of mental manipulation than fast and "direct" solutions. This is not entirely true—a powerful telepath can use the same esoteric tools of mind-reading and control to simply explode a victim's psyche (along with their brain) when more surreptitious or furtive techniques aren't viable. Soul Killer concentrates an enormous amount of your mental energy and then releases it all at once in a spectacular cacophony of incoherent emotions, images, and thoughts that might as well be a bomb going off in the target's head. This attack inflicts 1d10 Explosive Damage plus Damage equal to twice your Willpower Bonus, ignoring Armour. The attack is considered to affect the target's head for the purposes of determining Critical Damage and Effects.

Note that this power has no effect against inanimate targets, meaning it cannot be used to attack objects or certain servitors.
##### **Thought Sending**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Free Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 1km × Willpower Bonus

The signature ability of all telepaths, this basic form of telepathy allows you to send your thoughts into the minds of those around you. You may broadcast a short message—no more than one sentence per point of your Psy Rating—to a number of individuals of your choice equal to your Willpower Bonus, or indiscriminately to every creature within Range. Mainly intended for utility purposes, this power is not particularly difficult to resist. Individuals you target who do not wish to be contacted in this way can block out your thoughts with an **Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test**; the difficulty becomes **Routine (+20)** if you are broadcasting to everyone. Those who cannot see you when you manifest this power may even disregard anything they heard as an errant thought or an overheard remark from another person. Any creature affected by this power which does not share a language with you gains a further +20 bonus, as many of the mind's processes are still linked to the structure of language. 
##### **Terrify**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 8m

This power allows you to implant a concentrated mote of psychic terror in the minds of those around you, which they will invariably interpret as a brief glimpse into something out of their worst nightmares. You may affect a number of targets within Range up to your Willpower Bonus. Each target must pass a Willpower Test or be overcome with fear and horror—they must roll 1d100 on the **[Shock Table](fear%20and%20damnation.md#shock%20and%20snapping%20out%20of%20it)** to determine how profoundly it affects them.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may force one target to add +10 to their roll on the Shock Table.
##### **Zone of Compulsion**
**Threshold:** 21
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** 5m + Willpower Bonus

You unleash an indiscriminate wave of telepathic force that carries a single command and collides with anyone around you. This power functions identically to [Compel](telepathy.md#compel), but it affects all creatures within Range (both friend and foe alike). All targets within Range must make an Opposed Willpower Test against you, with failure indicating the power affects them as normal. You roll a single Willpower Test to oppose all those who may be affected—if you fail this Willpower Test outright the power ends immediately. Note that regardless of how many targets are within Range you may still only issue a single command each time you manifest this power.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you gain a +10 bonus on your Opposed Willpower Test.
