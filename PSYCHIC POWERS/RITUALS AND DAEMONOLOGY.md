*“The grand horror of the warp touches many minds; it is not merely the mind of the witch that can delve into the depths of the Immaterium. Through grand rituals and arcane rites, the devoted can speak to the Gods and beseech them for favour.”*
– Vandar Herroth, the Architect of Blasphemy

Sorcery, warpcraft, magic, call it what you will, is a real and deadly force in the 41st Millennium. The Imperium regards this “dark magic” as a great evil, a dire peril that awaits any who delve into knowledge of the forbidden. The truth of the matter is far more complex, a mess of paradox and contradiction that has consumed innumerable souls who have dared try and comprehend it.

What is known for certain is that through the use of certain mimetic formulae and esoteric equations, expressed variously as simple verbal or somatic patterns or through complex rituals of murder and discord, the stuff of the warp can be drawn through the fabric of reality. This warpcraft can be made to alter and corrupt physical matter, imbue objects with unnatural power, mutate flesh, summon forth entities from the Immaterium, and even create deliberate breaches or rifts in the structure of the universe itself. Within the Imperium to undertake such vile rites, or even to search out the means to do so, is a crime warranting the most severe punishments.

The malefic arts must either be independently researched, experimented with and honed with practice—a process fraught with peril—or be gleaned through the equally treacherous process of tutelage under a master occultist, or perhaps even a daemonic entity. As such, knowledge of these dark rituals is typically fragmentary and paradoxical, for what one sorcerer can accomplish with a gesture and an incantation, another will require sigils painted on the floor with the blood of the murdered as its ink.

“Chaos Ritual” is a catchall term that covers the diverse rites, occult formulae, and strange ceremonies by which the warp can be called upon to alter reality or its denizens summoned forth to erupt into the physical universe. Chaos Rituals can take a potentially endless variety of forms and are often inconsistent, malign, and irrational things, employing insane formula and centred on damaging reality in some way. Such a ritual acts like a flare unleashed into the endless dark tides of the warp beyond in order to attract the attention of daemons and ease their passage through the veil, or perhaps used to create a specifically desired buckling of physical laws and a release of occult energies that can be controlled and channelled by the ritual’s conductor for his own ends. Warp rituals are horrifically dangerous things whose potential scope is limited only by the depraved imagination of mankind and the ageless malevolence of the Ruinous Powers.
## **Performing Chaos Rituals**

In game terms, Chaos Rituals are there to achieve specific effects. A particular ritual might exist to summon a daemon, possess an unwilling victim, contact a powerful entity, taint an area with unholy forces, foretell the future, animate the dead, or simply rip open reality and let the daemons have their way… the list is potentially endless. As a general rule of thumb, the more complex and potent the effect to be achieved, the more difficult the ritual will be to accomplish.

Rituals require time and preparation to perform, and there are many difficulties in successfully carrying them out. These are either owing to the requirements of particular components (rare substances, sacrificial victims and the like) or other more arcane needs such as a particular astrological alignment, the fact that a particular locale must be used, and so forth. The warp is a gloriously anarchic realm, and the requirements it presupposes to mortals can be just as insane, bizarre, or unthinkable. Another difficulty worth noting is, of course, the attention of hostile forces, such as loyal agents of the Imperium or the inscrutable Eldar. Attracting such attention can make life very difficult for the malefic cultist.

Subject to such an endless variety of uses, Chaos Rituals seldom have much consistency. However, one constant throughout is that human suffering and death is an integral part of most—the release
of emotional and psychic energy is as the finest food and drink to the denizens of the warp—and what magi sometimes call the “**Rule of Sympathy**” often applies. That is to say, sympathetic objects and rites are used to help create the desired effect. For example, a ritual to summon a daemon of the Lord of Decay might well involve the use of rancid offal, rusted implements and diseased and contaminated sacrificial victims—all objects of sympathy to the nature of the creature being called upon.

Alternatively, the ritual might be structured to help weaken the barriers between reality and the warp. In such cases, during the rites hallucinogenic drugs, tortuous incantations, and numbing trances might be employed to attune the minds of the celebrants to visions of the beyond that may crawl their way through the rupturing synapses of the onlookers to take physical form.
## **The Daemonic Mastery Test**

Commanding a daemon is no minor thing, as even the least of entities that may answer a sorcerer’s call are malign creatures of rage and hate that would sooner rend a mortal apart for sport than serve one. In order to control a summoned daemon, a battle of wills is fought psychically between the summoner and the daemon, represented by an Opposed Willpower Test taking a Full Action to perform. If the summoner is a Psyker, he may add a +5 bonus to his test for every point of Psy Rating he has. This test is further modified by the various criteria indicated on **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**, the effects of Daemonic Presence, and any other pertinent factors.

If the summoner wins the contest, he may command the daemon to do his bidding, and it will follow his spoken and telepathic instructions clearly and accurately. If the summoner fails the Test, then the daemon is free to do as it wishes. It may immediately turn its anger against the fool that summoned it, feign obedience only to betray the summoner at a critical moment later, or simply refuse to follow the summoner's commands and partake in some other mayhem or savagery as it pleases.
#### **Breaking Mastery**

Daemons are absolutely alien-minded compared to mortals, untrustworthy and mercurial at the best of times, and it is always wise to simply summon them to do what they are best suited for—slaughter and butchery. If the daemon is forced to go against its fundamental nature in some way, it may attempt to break the summoner’s control, forcing a second Mastery Test, with a negative modifier for the controller of –30.
## **Using Rituals In Games**

The number of Chaos Rituals that exist within the 41st Millennium is immense, and they serve a crucial purpose to ongoing games, granting access to great powers and greater monstrosities, but not without cost or difficulty. **Table: Ritual Modifiers** provides particular examples of circumstances and observances that can increase or decrease the difficulty of successfully completing a ritual. Combine any applicable modifiers to arrive at a cumulative modifier of up to +60 or –60.

Chaos Rituals follow a basic structure which is presented below. 
##### **Chaos Ritual Template**
A ritual can be defined by the following criteria.
**Description:** This section describes what the ritual is for, why it is carried out, its origin and any other pertinent facts.
**Requirements:** What is needed to perform the ritual—specific components, time, place, and so on, as well as any Skill Tests, Corruption or Infamy level, or known Talents or Traits needed to make the ritual work properly. How well these Tests are made and the wider makeup of the ritual may affect the quality of the results achieved. Many factors, both esoteric and mundane, may affect a ritual’s
chance of success.
**Effects:** The successful effect of the ritual.
**Duration:** How long the ritual’s effects last.
**Cost:** The cost in physical and spiritual terms to those that carry out the ritual; from physical harm to the wrath of the daemonic.
**The Price of Failure:** All attempts to control the warp have an unpleasant cost should they fail. These consequences are listed here, usually represented by Psychic Phenomena, immediate Perils of the Warp, or in the specific cases of summoning or warp-rift opening rituals, a singularly-unpleasant effect called **Contempt of the Warp**.
##### **Table: Contempt of the Warp**

| Roll    | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-50   | **Ignored:** Silence and stillness greet the heretic’s efforts; he has failed, but has otherwise survived unscathed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 51-80   | **Mocked:** Howls of daemonic laughter fill the tortured air, and the heretic's worst secrets and shames are hurled at him in mockery. The character gains 1d5 Corruption Points for his trouble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 81-90   | **Struck Down:** The heretic is blasted by a retributive bolt of raw warp power, suffering 2d10 Energy Damage with the Warp Weapon quality. The foully seething energies fill the heretic, and he gains 1d10 Corruption Points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 91-100  | **Assailed:** For the heretic’s presumption, a daemon is dispatched to deal with him. A lesser daemon or similar warp entity chosen by the GM appears in the midst of the ritual. This daemon is an appointed nemesis to the heretic and is not subject to Mastery. If the ritual was to summon a daemon, then that daemon is successfully summoned, but it is not subject to Mastery and attacks the would-be summoner<br>immediately and ruthlessly. |
| 101-120 | **Possessed:** Chaos repays the heretic’s arrogance by making him its plaything, and an Unclean Spirit—or worse—attempts to overthrow his mind. If the ritual was to summon a daemon, then that daemon is summoned, but is not subject to Mastery, and will attempt to possess the would-be summoner.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 121+    | **Devoured:** Reality is sundered as the heretic is sucked screaming into the warp or devolved into a mindless, mewling puddle of twisted flesh known as a Chaos Spawn. The heretic is worse than dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
### **Common Chaos Rituals**
Below is a selection of rituals known by many of whose who truck with the Ruinous Powers.
#### **Bloodtide**
Among daemonologists and worshippers of the Blood God the tale of the great Bloodthirster, Ka’jagga’nath the Unbound, is particularly well known. This powerful daemon lord achieved great infamy during the First War of Armageddon for his ability to summon forth a terrible corrupting wave known as the Bloodtide. What the Bloodtide truly consists of is unfathomable—some say that it is the blood of the fallen given motive force for revenge against their killers, while others believe it is pure, unbridled warp energy in a form pleasing to Khorne himself. Others even claim it to be a machine or weapon of ancient and unholy design. The truth may never be known, but regardless of its origin, the Imperial defenders of Armageddon came to great despair and loathing of Ka’jagga’nath each time one of his abominable blood waves washed forth. After the war, some particularly dedicated servants of Khorne have been able to obtain a fraction of this power, conjuring some dark facsimile of the fabled Bloodtide to wash away those that stand in the path of Khorne’s desires for endless violence.
**Requirements:** Only a heretic dedicated to Khorne and who possesses the Forbidden Lore (Warp) Skill can perform this ritual. The Bloodtide must be performed in an area of great violence, ideally near or in the midst of a warzone, or in an area where many have recently been slain. An altar of some kind is required, preferably one made of the bones or corpses of fresh victims—the more opposed to Khorne the victims are, the better! The heretic also needs to have a firm direction or a destination for the Bloodtide in mind (for example, the Imperial Cathedral to the west, or the Slaaneshi shrine in the Hab-Dome above). Once the correct conditions have been found and the direction or target chosen, the heretic enacting the ritual must make a sacrifice to Khorne and pass a **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. Having the Scholastic Lore (Occult) or Scholastic Lore (Legend) Skill adds +10 to this Test. This sacrifice is what begins the ritual, and the heretic may sacrifice multiple victims to increase his chances of successfully summoning the Bloodtide; each sacrifice adds a +5 bonus to his Test.
**Effects:** The altar is consumed and a boiling torrent of blood suffused with unstable Warp energy blasts outwards in the chosen direction. All those that touch this surge become almost instantly corrupted, as a fraction of Ka’jagga’nath’s power washes outwards, drowning everything in its path. This flood stretches out like a weapon with the Flame quality for 100m x the Willpower Bonus of the heretic that enacted the ritual, plus an additional 100m for every degree of success. Those dedicated to Khorne are immune to the effects of the Bloodtide, and Khornate daemons ignore the [Warp Instability Trait](traits.md#warp%20instability) as long as they remain within the affected area. Unaligned heretics, as well as those dedicated to Tzeentch and Nurgle, suffer 2d10 Energy damage that ignores Toughness and Armour unless they can pass a **Difficult (–10) Willpower Test**. They must make this Test again for every ten minutes they spend within the affected area, but even if successful, they gain 2d10 Corruption Points. Everyone else, including Imperial agents, Eldar, and especially servants of Slaanesh, suffers the same effects, but the Willpower Test is **Arduous (–40)** and they must take the Test every 5 minutes. Against non-living objects, such as buildings and vehicles, the Bloodtide causes 2d10+8 Impact Damage that ignores Armour. The Bloodtide is treated as a psychic attack for the purposes of psychic protections and resistances.
**Duration:** 1d5 hours for every point of the heretic's Willpower Bonus, plus an extra hour for every
degree of success on the Forbidden Lore Test; GMs are encouraged to modify this time as desired to indicate the Bloodtide’s uncontrolled nature.
**Cost:** None beyond any material costs required to make the altar and preparation of the sacrifice.
**The Price of Failure:** If the ritual fails, the conducting heretic must Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**. If the heretic failed by two or more degrees of failure, the Bloodtide still occurs but, instead of a focused torrent, it floods outwards from the altar in all directions, covering everything out to half the distance it should have travelled originally. If this occurs, everyone, even those dedicated to Khorne, who it touches gains 2d10 Corruption Points as the Blood God mocks their failure.
#### **Call the Lord of Skulls' Soldier**
While Khorne employs no sorcerers, he is nevertheless frequently reliant upon the acts of mortals to bring his daemons into the material universe. Employed by cultists intent upon violence and bloodshed, this ritual summons a Bloodletter, one of the daemonic footsoldiers of Khorne, to do their bidding and slaughter their enemies.
**Requirements:** The ritual must take place at the site of battle or murder and requires an inscribed summoning circle marked out with invocations and sigils sacred to the Blood God. Braziers of boiling blood and burning coals must be placed at the cardinal points of the circle, and an adult human who has killed another during his life or a powerful predatory beast must be ritually killed and bled to summon the daemon as the correct prayers to the Lord of Skulls are roared with bestial fervour. A **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test** is required to successfully conduct the ritual, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. If the daemon is successfully summoned, then a **[Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** must immediately be taken in order to control it.
**Effects:** A Bloodletter appears at the centre of the summoning circle.
**Duration:** Once summoned, the Bloodletter remains corporeal for 1d5+5 Rounds, plus an additional Round for every degree of success on the Test to complete the ritual. This duration may be extended further by areas where the veil between reality and the warp is thin, or if the daemon slays enough living creatures to empower it further (this last is up to the GM, however he should keep in mind that daemons are often empowered by death and bloodshed, and may remain in the material realm longer because of it.) At the GM’s discretion, the ritual may be enacted to summon
a daemon for a specifi  task. In that case, the daemon may remain corporeal long enough to accomplish this.
**Cost:** Whether successful or not, the ritual causes an immediate roll on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**. Further, the mindless rage that accompanies a ritual to Khorne forces all participants to make a Willpower Test or [enter a frenzied state](talents.md#frenzy), lashing out at all those nearby. Note that this may prevent the Daemonic Mastery Test being attempted.
**The Price of Failure:** Failure results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
#### **Forge the Accursed Weapon**  
This ritual binds a daemon into a single weapon of the heretic’s choosing, sealing them together into a single hellish device. Wielding a daemon weapon is a sign of achievement for many champions of Chaos, giving them an implement of suitable awe to impress their followers and smite their foes with pure warp power.
**Requirements:** An appropriate weapon must be selected and anointed in a ritualistic fashion, and a ritual performed in a space with some significance to the patron god of the daemon the heretic intends to utilise. For example, the weapon may be anointed in human blood, daubing blasphemous runes upon it, and a single daemon must be summoned and held under the heretic’s control. An example location might be one where the veil between reality and the warp is thin, or upon ground which is sacred to an enemy of Chaos and has been defiled through sacrifice and iconoclastic acts. An example ceremony is one in which the weapon and the daemon must be within a ritual circle painted in a mixture of blood and bone dust and marked with runes of binding and enslavement. In addition, eight cultists must assist the ritual, bound in chains of black iron, chanting for eight hours before the ritual begins, and sacrificed to the Dark Gods at its conclusion. A **Hellish (–60) Forbidden Lore (Warp or Daemonology) Test** is required to successfully perform the ritual, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. The GM should also apply any other modifiers he feels are appropriate to the particular circumstance, such as a bonus for utilising a type of weapon that is favoured by a given Chaos God.
**Effects:** The daemon is bound within the weapon, creating a daemon weapon. Total the number of degrees of success gained on the Test to complete the ritual—this is the Binding Strength, which is used to determine the power and unnatural abilities of the weapon.
**Duration:** The resulting daemon weapon is permanent, unless the daemon is somehow released (for example, if the weapon were to be destroyed).  
**Cost:** The ritual is taxing to even the most powerful of heretics, drawing upon their fundamental essence and leeching it away in order to permanently bind a daemon in the materium. Every participant in the ritual suffers 2d10 Damage to every Characteristic as their bodies and minds are wracked by unstable warp discharges. In addition, the surging energies of the warp cause a single, immediate roll on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**. 
**The Price of Failure:** The binding fails to take and the daemon breaks free of the heretic’s control, moving to slaughter the mortal that presumed to enslave it, and any other creature that gets in its way. Further, the massive amounts of gathered warp energy intended for the ritual are unleashed, resulting in an immediate Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
#### **Ritual of Binding**
Heretics that desire the power of a daemon engine must undertake a dangerous rite—the Ritual of Binding—in order to merge a daemonic entity with their carefully prepared shell.
**Requirements:** Before enacting this ritual, heretics first need a shell for their daemon and need to choose what type of daemon they want to summon. There heretics must choose wisely, for the summoned daemon's Characteristics are used for many of the daemon engine's if the ritual succeeds. The Ritual of Binding takes place immediately after the heretics successfully summon the daemon they chose, and this ritual replaces any **[Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** the heretics might have taken. The binding requires a single **Hellish (–60) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**.
**Effects:** The daemon bonds to the shell, fusing metal and ætheric flesh. It is now a daemon engine.
**Duration:** Effectively permanent. Until the daemon breaks free or the daemon engine is destroyed, the effects of this ritual remain in place.
**Cost:** Melding a daemon's will to a war machine, a feat both the warp and the mortal realm abhor, is an unbelievably taxing process for even the most powerful heretic. Each participant suffers 4d10 Characteristic Damage to each of his Characteristics. Additionally, each participant involved must roll once on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)** and immediately suffer the results as the very stuff of the warp itself lashes out at their aberration.
**The Price of Failure:** The binding fails and the daemon breaks free of the heretic’s control, attacking them immediately and with great resentment for their transgression. Additionally, failure results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
#### **Ritual of Breaking**  
For many heretics, there is no greater symbol of authority than a warlord riding into battle astride a mighty daemonic steed. Breaking such a creature to their will and using it to carry forth the desires of the Dark Gods is a sure sign of domination, and many heretics have lost their lives—and their souls—whilst attempting to tame a Juggernaut of Khorne, catch a Slaaneshi Steed, or reshape a Screamer into a graceful Disc of Tzeentch.  
**Requirements:** Before a heretic can enact a Ritual of Breaking and claim a daemonic mount of his own, he must first summon the daemon that is to act as a mount. Most daemons cannot be used as mounts—even the most debased heretic would not be foolish enough to try to use a Horror or a Flamer as a mount—so generally this ritual is limited to Juggernauts of Khorne, Steeds of Slaanesh, and Screamers of Tzeentch (the latter must be reshaped into Discs, adding a further layer of difficulty for the heretic). Followers of Nurgle may instead attempt to summon some form of disgusting mount (a Beast of Nurgle perhaps); unaligned daemonic steeds do exist, and the GM should determine if breaking such a creature would be easier or more difficult depending on its form. Daemons to be used as mounts are always summoned using the Ritual of Wild Fury, following all the standard rules for that rite. The conditions for both the summoning and the breaking of the daemon also differ depending on the type of daemon, Khorne favouring death and slaughter, Slaanesh pleasure and pain, and so on. After the daemon is summoned, the heretic is not required to pass a **[Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)**—this ritual is made in place of that. In all instances, and assuming the daemon is summoned correctly, the Ritual of Breaking requires a **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**, followed by an Opposed Willpower Test against the steed’s Willpower Characteristic.  
**Effects:** The daemonic steed is now broken to the will of the heretic and can be ridden and controlled in accordance with the rules for [Wrangling](skills.md#wrangling).
**Duration:** As long as the summoned daemon remains corporeal. If the heretic can sustain the daemon, such as through the slaughter of living beings, bathing it in psychic energy, or by keeping it enraptured and overwhelmed with new sensations, then the daemon may be kept indefinitely. The breaking is not permanent, however, and if the daemon is ever banished to the warp (for whatever reason), then the control is lost.
**Cost:** The battle of wills between a daemonic steed and the heretic is intense, taking 10d5 hours, with the number of degrees of success in the Opposed Willpower Test subtracted from that duration. The heretic also gains 1 level of Fatigue for every 10 hours in the ritual, again subtracting the degrees of success from the number. The GM may also apply various injuries to the heretic as well (breaking a Juggernaut will likely result in a broken bone or two).  
**The Price of Failure:** If the heretic fails to break the daemonic steed, it attacks him immediately before returning to the warp; treat this as a [Surprise Round](combat.md#combat%20overview).
#### **Ritual of Castigation**
Those who fight in Khorne’s name are forbidden the use of psychic abilities, sorcery, and other warp-based powers, as to the Blood God these represent feeble cowardice and the unwillingness to show one’s true ability in combat. Some dedicated warriors even use Khorne’s power to dominate and destroy those that use such craven methods through the appropriately-named Ritual of Castigation.
**Requirements:** Unlike many other types of rituals, the Ritual of Castigation relies on the absence rather than the presence of the warp, and so it must be enacted within an area where the warp is at a minimum, or an area where the power of Khorne dominates. The heretics must carefully prepare the area they wish to protect, usually by lining the area with fresh blood, or spacing skulls and other bones every eight metres, and so on. Properly preparing the area takes 1 hour. This can be as small as a single room or corridor, or as large as a warehouse or hangar bay, but should be generally self-contained with clearly defined entrances and exits. Heretics who happen to be Psykers can involve themselves in the preparation for this ritual, but suffer the same effects should they stay within this space. Once the area has been chosen and it is free from anything that might disrupt the rite (for example, active Psychic Powers), whichever heretic is conducting the ritual must take either a **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology)** or **Scholastic Lore (Occult) Test**. This is modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. 
**Effects:** The prepared area is filled with the hatred Khorne holds for those that hide behind warp tricks and sorcerous ceremony. Any character who happens to be a Psyker within the area gains 1 level of Fatigue for every 2 Rounds he spends inside and reduces his effective Psy Rating by half as long as he remains within the area. If a character causes **[Perils of the Warp](psychic%20powers.md#perils%20of%20the%20warp)** for any reason all those within the area that are dedicated to Khorne ignore the effects.
**Duration:** One hour, plus one hour for every degree of success on the Forbidden Lore or Scholastic Lore Test made as part of the ritual. At the start of their Round, those that the ritual affects can spend a Full Action to make an **Opposed Very Hard (–30) Willpower Test** against the heretic that enacted the ritual to break the warding. If successful, the Psyker breaks through the warding and ignores its effects from that point forward, though any Fatigue the Psyker has accrued up until this point due to the Ritual of Castigation remains.
**Cost:** None beyond any material costs needed to prepare the ritual. The power of Khorne is given to any who seek slaughter in his name.
**The Price of Failure:** If the Test is failed by two or more degrees of failure, the heretics receive Khorne’s disdain rather than his protection. The strength is sapped from bodies as the Lord of Slaughter punishes those too weak to face his enemies themselves. Each heretic involved in the Ritual of Castigation halves their Strength Characteristic for the next 8 hours, and also loses the benefits of the [Unnatural Strength Trait](traits.md#unnatural%20characteristic%20%28X%29) if they have it. After 8 hours their Strength returns, but they must wait at least 8 days before they can attempt to unleash the Blood God’s loathing of Psykers upon their enemies again.
#### **Ritual of Fleshmoulding**
Rightly feared for their gruesome skin-changing talents, the twisted Flesh Shapers of Melancholia hold greater power than "just" their expert understanding of physical medico-artistry. Far more than mundane demented chirurgeons overcome with the need to cause pain, each Flesh Shaper forms a kind of commune with the warp, its power working through their blades and other cruel implements to ensure that their vile operations form an exquisite and excruciating ritual whose results humble any sublunary medicae's abilities.
**Requirements:** Only heretics dedicated to Slaanesh may attempt this ritual. The Ritual of Fleshmoulding requires a subject and one or more donors, none of whom need to be willing participants. The heretic must ensure that the “operating theatre” doubles as a shrine to Slaanesh; this could involve burning various types of conflicting incense and potent narcotics, defiling the air with extremely loud and discordant music, or even cutting both himself and the other participants six times before each stage of the surgery. The heretic must pass both a **Very Hard (–30) Medicae Test** and a **Difficult (–10) Scholastic Lore (Occult) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. If the subject is unwilling, the heretic gains a +10 bonus on these Tests, as Slaanesh finds his suffering especially pleasing. The donors need not possess any particular Traits or physiological features of interest to the heretic—the "gifts" the subject receives are derived more from the warp than the actual flesh of the donors.
**Effects:** The heretic grants one of the following Traits to the subject: [Amphibious](traits.md#amphibious), [Burrower](traits.md#burrower%20%28X%29), [Crawler](traits.md#crawler), [Dark Sight](traits.md#dark%20sight), [Deadly Natural Weapons](traits.md#deadly%20natural%20weapons), [Fear](traits.md#fear%20%28X%29), [Flyer](traits.md#flyer%20%28X%29), [Machine](traits.md#machine%20%28X%29), [Multiple Arms](traits.md#multiple%20arms%20%28X%29), [Natural Armour](traits.md#natural%20armour%20%28X%29), [Quadruped](traits.md#quadruped), [Regeneration](traits.md#regeneration%20%28X%29), [Size](traits.md#size%20%28X%29), [Sturdy](traits.md#sturdy), [Toxic](traits.md#toxic%20%28X%29), [Unnatural Characteristic](traits.md#unnatural%20characteristic%20%28X%29), or [Unnatural Speed](traits.md#unnatural%20speed%20%28X%29). Traits with an (X) variable begin at 1, increasing by 1 for each degree of success on the heretic's Medicae Test (to a maximum of 6). In the case of the Size Trait, the subject may increase or decrease by one step only. Alternatively, the subject's appearance may be modified to resemble that of one of the donors. The modification is not a perfect imitation, but is nevertheless quite convincing—the subject suffers no penalties to his [Disguise Test](skills.md#disguise) for impersonating the donor, instead gaining a +30 bonus to any Tests needed to maintain the ruse. For every two donors sacrificed in the ritual the heretic may add another modification (also to a maximum of 6).
**Duration:** The ritual takes six hours to perform, plus one additional hour for every donor sacrificed after the first and for any degrees of failure on either of the heretic's Tests. The modifications inflicted upon the subject are permanent.
**Cost:** If successful, the subject must spend 1d10 days minus his Toughness Bonus (minimum 1) recovering. Subjects who are not sworn to the Dark Gods suffer 1d10+5 Insanity Points—if the subject is unwilling, they gain a further 1d10 Insanity Points on top of that. Regardless of the outcome of the ritual, none of the donors survive.
**The Price of Failure:** If the ritual fails, the heretic horribly botches some aspect of the elaborate procedure, and must roll 1d10 on **[Table: Rending Critical Effects—Body](injury%20and%20healing.md#rending%20critical%20effects)**, adding +1 for each degree of failure, and immediately apply the result to the subject.
#### **Ritual of Futures Foretold**  
Many Psykers harness the Ruinous Powers in order to gain a glimpse into the future, hoping that even a few moments of such visions will help them triumph over their adversaries. Many fools have lost their minds attempting to divine what is to come, and even those with the proper training and discipline can risk madness from even the briefest glance into the infinite strands of possible fates.  
**Requirements:** Only a heretic with Psyker abilities as well as the [Psyniscience](skills.md#psyniscience) and both [Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) and (Warp) Skills](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) can perform this rite. Possessing any one of the following also adds +5 to the final Test: [Common Lore (Adeptus Astra Telepathica)](skills.md#common%20lore), [Scholastic Lore (Numerology), Scholastic Lore (Occult)](skills.md#scholastic%20lore), or Forbidden Lore (Psykers). This ritual must be performed in an area where the heretics wish to look directly into the future and find what is about to happen in that exact location. They may be looking for the identity of someone who is pursuing them, or looking to see if something they have built will still be standing in a few days time; they could be looking for themselves to ensure they survive whatever dark deed they are about to undertake, or anything else that involves looking directly into the future. The psyker undertaking the ritual is required to pass a **Very Hard (–30) Psyniscience Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. Other Psykers that meet the requirements for this ritual may assist the Psyker, adding +10 for each Psyker involved.  
**Effects:** The heretic creates a window into the future—no larger than 20m x 20m—that shows them what might come to happen in that exact location. The future is never perfectly clear, however, and what they see is somewhat blurry. Sound echoes horribly, and thus a **Very Hard (–30) Perception Test** is needed discern intelligible speech. The heretics cannot interact with anything they see, as they are looking into a warp-based window. The vision extends as far as 1 day into the future, with an additional day added for each degree of success on the Psyniscience Test. Such visions are never 100% accurate, though—such is the nature of the warp and the inscrutable whims of the Architect of Fate.  
**Duration:** The window lasts for a number of minutes equal to half the Willpower Bonus (rounding up) of the Psyker that took the Psyniscience Test, plus one minute for every degree of success on the Test.
**Cost:** The Psyker, and any who helped him, gain 1d10 levels of Fatigue after the window has dissipated. Additionally, assuming the Psyniscience Test was successful, everyone looking into the future gains 1d10 Insanity Points and must make an **Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test** or suffer 1d5 permanent Willpower damage.
**The Price of Failure:** If the Psyniscience Test is failed, roll once on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**, plus an additional roll for every degree of failure. The ritual cannot be re-performed in this area for 1d10 hours.
#### **Ritual of Loathing**
The warp is an endless ocean, and within its currents and flows there exist a multitude of vile entities that call no one Chaos God their patron. These loathsome, formless, craven, and vindictive creatures are possessed of limited intelligence but boundless hunger. Careless servants of the Chaos Gods often attempt to summon these hideous abominations in the hope of directing their eternally ravenous nature towards the enemy, but even these least daemons are not particularly easy to control, especially in large numbers.
**Requirements:** The Ritual of Loathing is a ritual that a heretic might turn to out of desperation, as it allows him to summon the lowest of the low, the very dregs of the warp—Furies, Ebon Geists, Unclean Spirits, Nether Swarms, and other incarnate lesser daemons. These gibbering hordes are plentiful, and can be summoned from even the most basic Chaos shrine and with limited preparation, but every heretic must be aware that the more they summon, the more uncontrollable they become. The heretic conducting the ritual must pass a Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. The Heretic must also pass a **[Routine (+20) Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** to control the Daemons, with a –10 penalty for every additional Daemon summoned after the first.
**Effects:** A single lesser daemon, such as a Fury, Nether Swarm, or Charnel Daemon appears at the centre of the summoning area. One additional daemon of the same type appears for every additional degree of success on the Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test. The amount of daemons summoned by this ritual cannot exceed the heretic’s Willpower Bonus.
**Duration:** The lesser daemon or daemons remain corporeal for 1d5 Rounds, plus one additional Round for every additional lesser daemon summoned after the first. This duration may be extended further by areas where the veil between reality and the warp is thin, or if the daemons slay enough living creatures to empower them further. At the GM’s discretion, the lesser daemons may be summoned for a specific task, in which case they remain corporeal long enough to accomplish the task. 
**Cost:** Whether successful or not, the ritual causes an immediate roll on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)** with a +10 modifier for every additional lesser daemon summoned after the first.
**The Price of Failure:** Failure results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
#### **Ritual of Many Eyes**
Daemons do not see time and space in the same way mortals do. Their viewpoints are as varied as the forms they take, and there are daemons that have walked the paths of the warp for endless aeons. Ancient and terrible, these twisted beings have seen many things in their long existence, and are quite willing to give up their secrets—for the right price. The Ritual of Many Eyes, itself a rite with many different names, allows those seeking knowledge to reach out to an ancient daemon without summoning it directly in the hope that it might share what it knows.
**Requirements:** The Ritual of Many Eyes is similar to other rituals where the goal is to summon a daemon; the main difference, however, is that the daemon is not being drawn out of the warp. Instead the rite attempts to give the daemon sufficient power to partially bleed through the veil, enough that it might communicate directly with the heretics that enacted the ritual. The heretics may enact this ritual if they wish to learn something that cannot be learnt via normal means (e.g. investigations, interrogations, and research would be of no use). They could ask about any immediate dangers they might soon face, the location of a rare artefact that could bring them greater power, or for where a hidden enemy base resides—the list is endless. Before the heretics can attempt this ritual they first must have knowledge of any daemonic entities that they could potentially call upon. This requires considerable research, and should be conducted according to the rules for establishing Investigation Benchmarks. If successful, they may move on to the next step and must find a secluded area with a high concentration of warp activity for the ritual, such as an area where many voidships enter and exit the warp, or the outer edges of a relatively stable warp storm. Once the location has been chosen, and the heretics have decided on the question they wish to ask, they then make a single **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. The expansiveness or obscurity of the question the heretics wish to ask should also affect the difficulty of this Test, and the GM should be careful not to allow the players too much leeway with what information they seek (asking for the location of
the Black Library, or where every Daemon Weapon in the galaxy is located is likely beyond the means of even the most knowledgeable daemons).
**Effects:** Reaching forth from the shadowy mists of the warp, a ghostly apparition—a daemon edging its way into reality—appears before the Heretics. The GM, speaking for the daemon, should challenge the heretics as to why they have called it, and the heretics should have a good answer. They may ask their question of the daemon, and should explain what they are willing to do for the daemon in return. The heretics may attempt an **[Arduous (–40) Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** in the hope of making the daemon more receptive to their questions, but if this fails then the daemon simply asks for more in return. The GM should give the heretics the answers they seek, but can be as vague or cryptic as he likes, or perhaps only offer part of the requested information, promising more once the heretics have done whatever the daemon has asked in return.
**Duration:** The research portion of this ritual can potentially take weeks or longer, but the actual Ritual of Many Eyes itself is a speedy affair of roughly an hour.
**Cost:** There is no cost associated with enacting the Ritual of Many Eyes, but the real cost is what the heretics are willing to promise the daemon in return for the information. Once the heretics have managed to complete what was asked of them, they must re-enact the rite, taking a further Forbidden Lore Test as described above in order to contact the daemon again and tell him of their success (or failure). No additional research is needed for this second rite.
**The Price of Failure:** Failing either the initial Scholastic Lore Test or the later Forbidden Lore Test means the heretics either cannot find the information they need, or found the wrong information. If they wish to attempt this rite again they must start from scratch. If the heretics fail to do what the daemon asked of them, then the consequences are far greater, and if this occurs the heretics have two choices. They can confront the daemon and explain their failure, resulting in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**. The GM should modify this roll by how badly the heretics failed in their assigned task (for example, failing to obtain an item the daemon wanted might incur a –10 penalty, whereas losing that same item to the hands of the daemon’s sworn rivals might incur
a –30 penalty). Their other option is to not contact the daemon at all, in which case they run the risk of gaining the daemon’s enmity. The GM can then perhaps use the daemon’s anger into the ongoing campaign via random attacks, runs of bad luck, or any other warp-based horrors that might seem particularly fiendish. In either case, the daemon never helps the heretics again, and
woe unto them should it ever escape the immaterium.
#### **Ritual of Possession**
Daemons commonly enter the material plane by possessing unfortunate humans against their will. Few daemons have the strength to do it themselves, but many Chaos servants actively invite daemons into the material plane by offering host bodies to control.
**Requirements:** The Ritual of Possession actually encompasses a variety of ritual types used to summon almost any type of daemon. However, rather than directly calling the daemon into the material plane, the heretics instead draw it into a living vessel—not always human, but at least sentient—and the daemon uses the host body to sustain itself. Much like the Ritual of Binding, the heretics must choose the type of daemon they wish to summon and complete the summoning ritual for that daemon before undertaking the Ritual of Possession. With the caemon successfully summoned, the heretics enact the Ritual of Possession in place of the **[Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** by passing a **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. If they succeed, the heretics channel the daemon into the host, but the daemon must still beat the host with an Opposed Willpower Test before the possession takes effect. Unwilling hosts gain a +20 bonus to this Test.
**Effects:** The daemon possesses the host, granting the host extraordinary powers.
**Duration:** If the host is a Player Character the possession is is likely permanent, although an exorcism may be able to expel the daemon from the host's body if everything goes smoothly. Non-Player Character (NPC) hosts rarely survive long. If the daemon’s Willpower Characteristic is less than the host’s, the possession lasts as many hours equal to the host’s Willpower Bonus. If the daemon’s Willpower Characteristic is higher than the host’s, then the possession lasts half as many hours as the host’s Willpower Bonus. When the time limit runs out, the daemon either bursts from the host’s body, killing the host before vanishing, or leaves the host and retreats back to the
warp, leaving mentally and physically scarred but still somehow alive. 
**Cost:** The Ritual of Possession takes twice as long as any standard summoning ritual. The host, once exorcised, or if the daemon leaves (and if he survives), permanently reduces his Fellowship by 3d10 and his Wounds by 1d5. The host also gains 2d10 Corruption Points, the [Psyniscience Skill](skills.md#psyniscience) at a +10, and the [Fearless](talents.md#fearless) and [Resistance (Psychic Powers) Talents](talents.md#resistance).
**The Price of Failure:** Failing to successfully possess a host results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure on either the Forbidden Lore Test or the Opposed Willpower Test. Additionally, if the ritual fails, the host must make a Willpower Test or perish outright, his soul dragged into the warp to be devoured by the daemon.
#### **Ritual of Slaughter**
It is quite common for those that fight in the name of Khorne to call upon the God of Blood for his protection, guidance, or (in most cases) more power. Much of this pleading goes unanswered, as the majority of those who march to war under the bloodsoaked banners of Khorne are but chattel to be butchered in an endless cycle of death and destruction. There are some more formal rituals, though, that can be used to draw power from the warp and bestow the blessing—such as it is—of the Lord of Skulls. Asking such a malevolent and wild entity for his support is a dangerous game, however, and Khorne’s favour can be ripped away at a whim and for almost no reason other than his own murderous desires.
**Requirements:** The Ritual of Slaughter is used to gain favour or power for a specific combat related task, and only those dedicated to Khorne or those who are unaligned can benefit from its effects. Before the heretics can enact this ritual, they must have a specific need in mind. They might beseech Khorne so that their weapons grow more potent (gaining the Tearing quality) or their reflexes quicker (a bonus to Initiative) in their next battle. They could ask for Khorne’s protection (a re-roll on Dodge or Parry Tests), or for Khorne’s strength in the face of the insidious nature of the Corpse-God’s followers (the ability to ignore Sanctified Weapons, or resistance to Psychic Powers those loyal to the Imperium cast on them). The request cannot be too broad (the players cannot ask for an immunity to Damage, for instance, or to always pass their Dodge Tests), and the GM should ensure that the favour granted by Khorne is both useful and is thematically suitable to the Blood God's domains of bloodlust, murder, and martial prowess, while still remaining relatively small scale with a specific game effect. The heretics should also work out what they can offer in return—a promise to slay a certain amount of their enemies, or to sunder an Imperial shrine, and similar such guarantees—and the GM should ensure that the heretics are given a chance to fulfil this promise, or add the condition that the effects of the ritual only take effect once they have done what they promised. The ritual itself needs to be completed in a secluded area, perhaps at a shrine dedicated to Khorne, and with a sacrifice fitting the God of Murder such as a huge mound of fresh skulls, weapons taken from the defeated, or Khornate brass icons drenched in blood. A single **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test** is then required, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**.
**Effects:** The heretics gain the benefits they asked for and that the GM agreed to.
**Duration:** As long as is necessary for the heretics to complete the task they promised to Khorne, or as otherwise agreed to in the rite.
**Cost:** Obtaining the favour of the Blood God automatically gives each heretic involved 1d5 Corruption Points. Other than Khorne's expectation of violence in his name there is no further cost.
**The Price of Failure:** There is no penalty for failing the Forbidden Lore Test—Khorne merely ignores the heretics' pleas for aid. However, should the heretics be unable to deliver on the promise or pledge they made, each must Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**. Additionally, the heretics are forbidden from even attempting the ritual again until they have performed some great and terrible deed in the name of Khorne to restore his favour.
#### **Ritual of Sundering**  
While it is true that those gifted (or cursed) with the ability to manipulate the warp and draw forth its energies can use it to cause destruction on a tremendous level, the reality is that even the most formidable sorcerer can only use but a fraction of the nigh-limitless might the warp holds. In an effort to enhance the potency of their abilities, some sorcerers have learnt of a ritual that can break the veil between reality and the immaterium. Known as the Ritual of Sundering, this series of risky and potentially devastating rites can cause raw energy to bleed through into reality, allowing Psyker of all types greater access to the warp. The effects of the ritual tend to escalate quickly, however, and once started the sorcerer has virtually no control over the scale or magnitude of what they have wrought.  
**Requirements:** Only a heretic with Psyker abilities as well as the [Psyniscience](skills.md#psyniscience) and [Forbidden Lore (Warp) Skills](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) can perform this rite; if the heretic is trained in [Scholastic Lore (Occult)](skills.md#scholastic%20lore) or [Forbidden Lore (Psykers)](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) this adds +10 to the final Test. The Ritual of Sundering should ideally be performed in an area that is undergoing an upheaval of some sort, such as the midst of a battle, within a million-strong horde of cultists chanting before a demagogue, or even during another ritual that involves the summoning of daemons. Once the correct conditions have been found, the Psyker must pass a **Difficult (–10) Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test** to successfully conduct the rite, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**.
**Effects:** A radius equal to the Psyker’s Psy Rating in kilometres (measured from the Psyker) becomes infused with the energy of the warp. All Psykers treat their Psy Rating as being two levels higher, the Tests made as part of any Ritual that involve either summoning daemons or directly accessing the warp become two steps easier, and any and all forms of psychic resistance (including pieces of wargear that negate Psychic Powers, such as psychic hoods) become only half as effective. Every Round this ritual remains in effect the GM should roll once on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**. Each heretic or character gains 1d5 Corruption Points for every full hour spent within the area of effect. Characters with the [Daemonic Trait](traits.md#daemonic) do not gain Corruption Points, but are immune to [Warp Instability](traits.md#warp%20instability) whilst within the area.  
**Duration:** 2d5 x the heretic's Psy Rating hours. The practical outcome of this ritual can be impossible to predict—add an extra hour for every degree of success on the Forbidden Lore Test if that number is even, and subtract it if the number is odd. Every other hour, the GM should also randomly alter the radius and point of origin by 1d5 hundred metres as the area of sundered reality drifts about like a cloud of miasma on the wind.
**Cost:** Although the Ritual of Sundering is often used to gain an advantage, the sheer uncontrollable nature of its effects means that eventually everything within the area begins to suffer. Everyone, aside from those with the Daemonic Trait, must make a **Difficult (–10) Willpower Test** for every half hour they spend within the area of effect. If this Test is failed they gain 1 Level of Fatigue and lose 1d10 Wounds (reduced by Willpower Bonus, but not by Toughness Bonus or Armour). Anyone who gains three of more cumulative degrees of failure whilst within the ritual's area also gains a randomly determined [minor mutation](fear%20and%20damnation.md#mutation). 
**The Price of Failure:** If the Ritual of Sundering is unsuccessful then the Psyker that conducted the rite must must Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**. Additionally, unrestrained backlash from the warp cascades forth as a fraction of the potential energy is released, and the GM rolls once for  [Perils of the Warp](psychic%20powers.md#perils%20of%20the%20warp) for each degree of failure the Psyker incurred on the Forbidden Lore Test.
#### **Ritual of Terror Untold**
Attempting to bring a greater daemon into the world is usually a task for the foolish or insane; most small cults and groups of Chaos worshippers that try often fail, and always with tremendously grizzly results. Harnessing the power of a greater daemon requires great skill, patience, and an unrivalled knowledge of the dark arts. The rewards for a successful summoning are limitless, as the heretics will have at their disposal an entity of unbridled destruction and untold terror. The punishments for failure, however, are often too horrible to even contemplate.
**Requirements:** Before a greater daemon can be summoned, the heretics need to obtain a host, someone to act as the bridge between the warp and the material plane. The host must be a living being—not necessarily human, but at least sentient—and need not be a willing participant. Fundamentally the act of summoning a greater daemon follows the same general precepts as a lesser daemon, but with a grievously greater cost. If 8 warriors must die in ritual combat in order to summon a Bloodletter, then 800 warriors must die before a Bloodthirster even contemplates appearing before the heretics. If it required 6 days of endless torture on 6 unfortunate captives to bring a Daemonette into the world, then it might take 6 weeks of torture to entice a Keeper of Secrets through the veil. Generally speaking though, summoning a greater daemon is a massive undertaking that can take days, if not weeks, to complete, and the heretics should be aware that their combined efforts are required to ensure it occurs successfully. Additionally, the heretics must have an exceptionally good reason (and GM concurrence) for summoning a greater daemon, as these creatures are destructive and violent and do not like to be called upon for minor tasks. The final requirements for such a difficult task are up to the GM, and the ritual requires an **Arduous (–40) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. If the host was a willing sacrifice, this Test becomes **Very Hard (–30)** instead. If the greater daemon is successfully summoned, and if the heretics are feeling very worthy (or suicidal), then they may attempt to control the greater daemon via a **[Hellish (–60) Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)**. If unsuccessful, the greater daemon is almost certain to turn its hideous attentions towards the fools that dared try to command it.
**Effects:** The host is instantly and spectacularly annihilated by the greater daemon's "birth" in the materium, appearing where the host once stood. All heretics involved in the successful summoning of a greater daemon gain 2d10 Corruption and Insanity Points from the great and terrible spectacle.
**Duration:** As the heretics should have a specific purpose in mind for their summoned creature, the GM is free to allow the greater daemon to remain corporeal for as long as it needs to complete that task (or until it grows tired of the heretics, or deems their request unworthy of its attentions).
If a specific amount of time is required, then a greater daemon remains corporeal for 1d10+10 hours, plus two additional hours for every degree of success on the Test to complete the ritual.
**Cost:** Bringing a greater daemon out from the warp is a catastrophically destructive event that shatters reality. The ritual causes two occurrences of [Perils of the Warp](psychic%20powers.md#perils%20of%20the%20warp), rolling twice and applying both results. Additionally, every character within 100m of the greater daemon’s violent emergence point (or larger, if the GM considers it appropriate) must take four **Hard (–20) Tests**:
* A Toughness Test, to avoid being [Blinded](injury%20and%20healing.md#blinded) for 1d10 minutes from witnessing the creature's abominable birth.
* An Agility Test, to avoid being knocked [Prone](combat.md#prone) from the psychic shockwave and suffering 1d10 Impact Damage, which ignores Armour and Toughness.
* A Willpower Test, to avoid taking 1d10 permanent Willpower Damage from the greater daemon's unholy presence.
* A Strength Test, to avoid gaining 1d10 levels of [Fatigue](injury%20and%20healing.md#fatigue) and becoming [Stunned](combat.md#stunned%20targets) for 1d10 Rounds as the daemon’s very breathing and heartbeat tortures the surrounding reality itself.
**The Price of Failure:** Failing to summon a greater daemon is a decidedly dire situation that could well be the last mistake the heretics make. If the Ritual of Terror Untold is unsuccessful, the heretic that conducted the rite must Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +20 for every degree of failure. Every other heretic involved in the Ritual must also Test for Contempt of the Warp with a +10 modifier. Additionally, failing in such an endeavour will not go unnoticed, and everyone involved in the failed summoning suffers a –10 penalty on any ritual Tests made towards the greater daemon's patron god. If the GM is in a particularly cruel mood, a failed ritual can still result in the greater daemon being summoned (and the host’s death), but the greater daemon turns on the heretics, attacking them immediately or perhaps biding its time until an especially devastating opportunity presents itself.
#### **Ritual of Wild Fury**  
No daemon can ever be truly controlled. No matter the power of a mortal master, all daemons possess the will and the ability to unshackle their bonds and bring doom and destruction to any they see fit. Some daemons, however, are more uncontrollable or bestial than others. A Bloodletter is an intelligent and malevolent force, capable of wielding grim weapons in its clawed talons, yet a Screamer of Tzeentch is a far more instinctual creature, wheeling and diving across the unseen eddies of the warp as it searches for prey. Summoning daemonic beasts is a risky proposition, as a heretic cannot reason with a Fiend of Slaanesh or a Flamer of Tzeentch. They are, in a sense, animalistic, and always respond violently to those that would attempt to control them.  
**Requirements:** Summoning a daemonic beast or steed such as a Flamer of Tzeentch or Beast of Nurgle uses the same basis as any of the other daemonic summoning rituals. The type of beast the heretics are attempting to bring into the world determines the ritual template—for example, if attempting to summon a Flesh Hound of Khorne, use the ritual for summoning a Bloodletter as a starting point. As demonic beasts respond just as easily (if not better) to stimuli from the material plane, the heretics need not create larger areas of slaughter, pleasure, disease, or change than they would otherwise have to do for a typical lesser daemon. The rite requires a **Difficult (–10) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**, but GMs are free to modify this should appropriate circumstances dictate. If the daemonic beast is successfully summoned, then a **[Difficult (–10) Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** must be taken in order to control it. A particularly bold or ambitious heretic might try to utilise such a daemonic beast as a mount through the Ritual of Breaking.
**Effects:** A daemonic beast, specific to the Chaos God the players asked for, appears at the centre of the summoning area.  
**Duration:** The daemonic beast remains corporeal for 1d5+5 Rounds, plus an additional Round for every additional degree of success on the Test to complete the ritual. At the GM’s discretion, the daemon may be summoned for a specific task, in which case it remains corporeal long enough to accomplish the task.  
**Cost:** Whether successful or not, the ritual and the wild nature of the summoned beast causes two immediate rolls on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**.
**The Price of Failure:** Failure results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
#### **Summon Slaanesh's Handmaiden**
The servants of the Prince of Torments are many and varied, but most numerous amongst them are the Daemonettes, handmaidens and courtiers to their master and creator. Cultists of excess draw Daemonettes into the material world to partake of mortal sensation or to engage in orgies of mind-bending destruction.
**Requirements:** The ritual must take place in a location where great debauchery and excess has taken place, and requires an inscribed summoning circle marked out with invocations and symbols sacred to the Dark Prince. Braziers of hallucinogenic incense and vast quantities of intoxicating elixirs are spread around the ritual site. Six adult humans made delirious by blessed narcotics must be slashed with anointed knives, marked with daemonic runes, and then murdered. A **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test** is required to successfully conduct the ritual, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. If the daemon is successfully summoned, then a **[Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** must immediately be taken in order to control it.
**Effects:** A Daemonette appears at the centre of the summoning circle.
**Duration:** Once summoned, the Daemonette remains corporeal for 1d5+5 Rounds, plus an additional Round for every degree of success on the Test to complete the ritual. This duration may be extended further by areas where the veil between reality and the warp is thin, or if the daemon slays enough living creatures to empower it further. At the GM’s discretion, the ritual may be enacted to summon a daemon for a specific task. In that case, the daemon may remain corporeal long enough to accomplish this.
**Cost:** Whether successful or not, the ritual causes an immediate roll on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**. Further, the overwhelming ecstasy that accompanies a ritual to Slaanesh forces all participants to make a Willpower Test or become [Stunned](combat.md#stunned%20targets) as they writhe in joy and agony. Note that this may prevent the Daemonic Mastery Test being attempted.
**The Price of Failure:** Failure results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
#### **Summon the Cackling Spellfiend**
The Horrors of Tzeentch are bizarre, unpredictable creatures wrought from flame and magic and twisted flesh, frequently called upon by sorcerers and cultists to wreak havoc upon the world, their myriad limbs and pseudopodia spitting gouts of arcane fire with the kind of insane abandon that only a daemon could produce.
**Requirements:** The ritual must take place in a location desolated by fire or magic and requires an inscribed summoning circle marked out with symbols sacred to the Changer of Ways. Enchanted braziers spewing multi-coloured smoke and flame are arrayed at random points around the circle, and an adult human branded with arcane runes, to be reduced to ashes by magic and flame at the culmination of the ritual, is placed in the centre. A **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test** is required to successfully conduct the ritual, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. If the daemon is successfully summoned, then a **[Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** must immediately be taken in order to control it.
**Effects:** A Pink Horror appears at the centre of the summoning circle.
**Duration:** Once summoned, the Pink Horror remains corporeal for 1d5+5 Rounds, plus an additional Round for every degree of success on the test to complete the ritual. This duration may be extended further by areas where the veil between reality and the warp is thin, or if the daemon slays enough living creatures to empower it further. At the GM’s discretion, the ritual may be enacted to summon a daemon for a specific task. In that case, the daemon may remain corporeal long enough to accomplish this.
**Cost:** Whether successful or not, the ritual causes an immediate roll with a +20 modifier on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**, for such is the influx of untamed arcane power that accompanies rituals devoted to Tzeentch.
**The Price of Failure:** Failure results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
#### **Unleash the Foetid Footman**
Plague Cults often summon Plaguebearers to help them in the spreading of disease and corruption. Obsessed with counting and cataloguing every contagion ever created, Plaguebearers welcome any chance to push through to the mortal realm to spread decay and misery.
**Requirements:** The ritual must take place in an area touched by disease and the stench of death, and requires a roughly carved circle marked with icons devoted to Nurgle while cauldrons of putrid bubbling liquids fill the entire area with a horrid stench. Rotting corpses—they needn’t be human—should form a pile at the centre. A single adult human, their body untouched by disease or illness, should sit atop the pile of corpses, acting as a beacon to draw the daemon's attention. The ritual requires a **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**. If successful, then the Heretic must make a **[Daemonic Mastery Test](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#the%20daemonic%20mastery%20test)** to control the Plaguebearer once it appears.
**Effects:** A Plaguebearer appears in the summoning circle.
**Duration:** The Plaguebearer remains corporeal for 1d5+5 Rounds, plus an additional Round for every degree of success on the Test. Areas where the veil between reality and the Warp is thin might extend this duration. Heretics may summon the daemon for a specific task (at the GM’s discretion), in which case it remains corporeal long enough to accomplish the task.
**Cost:** Whether successful or not, the ritual causes an immediate roll on **[Table: Psychic Phenomena](psychic%20powers.md#psychic%20phenomena)**. Additionally, each character involved in the ritual must pass a Toughness Test or gain 1d5 levels of Fatigue, doubling over and choking on the waves of smog and clouds of flies that accompany the daemon’s arrival. The healthy human used in the preparation of the ritual actually survives the daemon's summoning, but they are inflicted with a random disease—possibly something merely debilitating, but could just as easily be the hideous Nurgle's Rot—from the Plaguebearer's manifestation in reality.
**The Price of Failure:** Failure results in a Test for the **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**, modified by +10 for every degree of failure.
### **Curses**
A sub-type of ritual, Curses go beyond asking for favour or summoning some hellish nightmare from the warp. They allow heretics to direct the attention of the warp down upon a specific target, typically a person the heretic has great animosity towards. Calling down a Curse is a risky pursuit, and when done incorrectly they can backfire catastrophically. Curses generally follow the rules for other Chaos Rituals, but also have a few particular ones that apply only to them:
##### **Learning the Words**
Simply wishing woe and bad-tidings upon his foes is never enough, and so the heretic must know the specific Curse he wishes to inflict. The GM should treat all Curses as an Elite Advance, with an xp cost between 200 and 500 depending on the strength of the Curse and the difficulty in researching it. The heretic should obtain Curses as part of his journey, both by whom he encounters as well as through role-play and investigation.
##### **Calling a Curse**
Before a heretic can call a Curse, he must have a target in mind. The target must be a specific person or entity, and the heretic must have a strong idea of whom the target is, where he is, and a compelling reason for calling the Curse (the GM has final say on whether the reason is good enough). Finally, as Curses are intimate acts of personal hatred, the heretic’s association with the target determines the base Difficulty Level:

* The heretic has never met or seen his target (–60).
* The heretic has seen and/or been in the presence of his target (–50).
* The heretic has spoken with his target at least once (–40).
* The heretic has had a number of minor dealings with his target (–30).
* The heretic and his target know one another (–20).
* The heretic and his target have had numerous dealings over several years (–10).
* The heretic and his target have known one another for many years (+0).

Each Curse has its own base Difficulty Rating, so the heretic must combine both difficulties (along with any other relevant modifiers) before taking any Tests. Targets afflicted by a Curse cannot suffer the effects of a new Curse until the first Curse ends.
##### **Breaking a Curse**
Curses are lasting, and unless stated otherwise the effects do not end on their own. Worshippers of the God-Emperor may be able to end a Curse by receiving an exorcism from a suitably capable priest of the Ecclesiarchy. Other heretics, meanwhile, must enact a "Counter-Curse" in order to end a Curse’s effects, effectively cancelling out the original caller's spite with their own. To cure a Curse, the afflicted must enact the same Curse placed upon him, but with himself as the target rather than someone else. The victim must know the specific Curse before attempting to counteract it. Successfully completing the Counter-Curse cures the afflicted of its effects. Failure means the Curse continues.
##### **Reap What You Have Sown**
When a Heretic fails to enact a Curse, do not roll for **[Contempt of the Warp](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#chaos%20ritual%20template)**; instead, the effects of the Curse now apply to the heretic—or heretics if the Curse involved multiple callers—for a number of weeks equal to the heretic’s Willpower Bonus, plus one day for each degree of failure on the Test. Heretics that fail to enact a Curse cannot reattempt the failed Curse against the same target as the warp scorns their weakness and ineptitude.
#### **Choking Darkness (Curse)**
The heretic calls upon the Gods of Chaos to manifest their victim’s inner darkness as an impenetrable shroud of gloom. Once afflicted, the cursed victim wanders, nearly blind, as his own unspeakable acts cause him to lose sight of everything he ever strived to achieve.
**Requirements:** This Ritual is a Curse, only works on targets with Corruption who have at least briefly consorted with the Dark Gods. It has no effect upon the pure, sanctified, or those who are truly ignorant about the ways of the Ruinous Powers. The heretic must have comprehensive knowledge of their target’s most heinous acts, a list of which they speak aloud to the Chaos Gods as they beseech their power. The heretic conducting the Curse must pass either a **Forbidden Lore (Heresy) Test** or a **Forbidden Lore (The Warp)** **Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**, and the **[Calling a Curse** modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#calling%20a%20curse).
**Effects:** If successful, the Curse’s target gains the [Blinded](injury%20and%20healing.md#blinded) and [Deafened](injury%20and%20healing.md#deafened) conditions. The target may attempt to temporarily relieve the effects of the Curse by passing a **Hard (–20) Willpower Test**. If successful, the Blinded and Deafened effects stop for a number of Rounds equal to the target’s Corruption Bonus plus one additional Round for each degree of success.
**Strength in Darkness:** Whilst this is an easy Curse to learn and cast, its effects are also quite limited. Choking Darkness wears off by itself after a number of days equal to the target’s Corruption Bonus.
#### **Dark Mirror (Curse)**
The heretic calls upon Slaanesh to punish his enemies by turning their own deeds back on them. As the afflicted wounds his foes, so too does his own flesh tear. As the afflicted burns the masses, so too does his own skin erupt into flames. The more pain he brings, the more he receives.
**Requirements:** Only heretics dedicated to Slaanesh may speak this Curse. The heretic must conduct a small, secluded ritual in which something belonging to their target is destroyed in full view of a representation of the target. This representation might be a holopict of the target, a wax effigy, or a painting done in his blood. After destroying the object, the heretic sets the representation of the target on fire and must consume the still-warm ashes. The ritual must be conducted alone, without even any others knowing of it, and requires a **Very Hard (–30) Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test** or a **Very Hard (–30) Scholastic Lore (Occult) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**, and the **[Calling a Curse** modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#calling%20a%20curse).
**Effects:** If successful, whenever the Curse’s target causes any Damage, he must pass a **Difficult (–10) Willpower Test** or immediately suffer 1d5 Damage that ignores Armour, Toughness, and even force fields. The Damage is of the same type inflicted by the curse's target, and the wounds he suffers have a similar appearance to those inflicted by the target's weapons. If the target’s attack killed his victim, the Willpower Test becomes **Very Hard (–30)** instead.
**Bloodline Curse:** The heretic may attempt to Curse his enemy’s entire bloodline so that all who follow suffer the same torture. To do this, the object the heretic destroys must be something highly significant to his target—his favourite weapon, a most trusted servant or loved one, a trinket that he annihilated 10,000 souls to obtain, and so forth—and the heretic must make both a Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test and a Scholastic Lore (Occult) Test. These are made at the same Difficulty after calculating for the Ritual modifiers and Calling a Curse modifiers. Both Tests must pass—if either one fails, the heretic is subject to the **[Reap What You Have Sown](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#reap%20what%20you%20have%20sown) rule** as normal.
#### **Endless Terror (Curse)**
The heretic calls upon the Dark Gods to unsettle the mind of his enemy, to visit terrors upon him, and to leave him cold and cowering before the might of the warp. A foe whose mind is cursed sees every moment of every day as an endless nightmare, and when rest finally arrives borne of paranoid exhaustion, sleep is fitful and disturbed, as the dark visions reach into his very dreams.
**Requirements:** The heretic must learn something of their target’s fears. This could be anything from a figure or entity that genuinely terrifies the target, someone from their past, something they fear losing, or even an irrational phobia. Once known, the heretic calling the Curse must pass either a **Hard (–20) Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test** or a **Hard (–20) Scholastic Lore (Occult) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**, and the **[Calling a Curse** modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#calling%20a%20curse).
**Effects:** If successful, the Curse’s target treats all living things as if they had the [Fear (1) Trait](fear%20and%20damnation.md#degrees%20of%20fear)—creatures that already have a Fear Rating count theirs as being 1 higher (to a maximum of 4). Due to the target’s disrupted sleep patterns, [recovering from Fatigue](injury%20and%20healing.md#fatigue) takes four times as long as it normally would. [Fearless](talents.md#fearless) adversaries remain unaffected by Fear, but still suffer the penalties associated with Fatigue and ineffectual sleep.
**Bloodline Curse:** The heretic may attempt to curse his enemy’s entire bloodline so that all who follow suffer the same endless horrors. To do this, the heretic must take the Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test or Scholastic Lore (Occult) Test twice, and both Tests must pass. If either one fails, then the Heretic is subject to the **[Reap What You Have Sown](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#reap%20what%20you%20have%20sown) rule** as normal, but the curse’s effects cover not only himself, but also all his allies and close associates as well.
#### **Words of Power (Curse)**
For those with knowledge of the Primordial Truth, there are many words known to hold tremendous and unholy power. Used in complex and intricate rituals, these mighty words bring forth all manner of maladies and afflictions upon their unfortunate victims. Heretics must take considerable care to prepare themselves mentally, as while learning a Word of Power is easy, learning the word’s own ritual is extremely taxing and time consuming. The ritual must be memorised, as writing any of it down would rob it of its potency, but the results can be very much worth the effort.
**Requirements:** Before a heretic uses the Word of Power, he must learn both the Word of Power he wishes to use as well as the specific Curse associated with it. The former is often trivial, but the latter requires extensive efforts such as a Compact or through Logic and Scholastic Lore (Cryptology or Occult) Tests. Once the heretic has selected the Word of Power he wishes to use and learned the complete ritual, he must recite the entire Curse from memory. This requires two successful **Very Hard (–30) Forbidden Lore (Heresy) Tests** or a **Very Hard (–30) Speak Language (Low Gothic) Test**, modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)**, and the **[Calling a Curse** modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#calling%20a%20curse). If the heretic has either Trade (Linguist) or Trade (Remembrancer) then these Tests are Challenging (+0).
**Effects:** If successful, the Curse’s target suffers an effect determined by the Word of Power the heretic chose. Below is a selection of words, including some that may only be called by followers of a particular Chaos God.
* Bane: Each time the victim takes Damage, there is a 10% chance the attack inflicts additional Damage equal to the victim's Corruption Bonus.
* Banish: The victim gains the [Warp Instability Trait](traits.md#warp%20instability). If the victim already has the Warp Instability Trait, then all Willpower Tests associated with this Trait become Hard (–20).
* Benumb (Slaanesh): The victim halves their Agility and Perception (rounding up).
* Bewilder: When attempting or defending against Awareness, Charm, Command, Deceive, Intimidate, Logic, or Scrutiny Tests, the victim suffers an additional –20 penalty.
* Bind: If the victim is a Psyker, this reduces his Psy Rating by an amount equal to his Willpower Bonus (to a minimum of 1).
* Blaze (Tzeentch): Each time the victim takes Damage there is a 10% chance the attack is treated as if it came from a weapon with the Flame quality. If the attack already had the Flame quality, the Agility Test to avoid catching on fire becomes **Very Hard (–30)**.
* Bleed (Khorne): Each time the victim takes Damage, there is a 10% chance the attack causes [Blood Loss](injury%20and%20healing.md#blood%20loss).
* Blight (Nurgle): Each time the victim takes Damage, there is a 10% chance the attack gains the Toxic quality. If the attack already has the Toxic quality, the victim suffers additional Damage on a failed Toughness Test equal to his Corruption Bonus.
## **On Daemonhosts And Their Creation**

For those who would use the fell powers of the warp to achieve their goals, there is little that is more tantalising than the thought of having a daemon at command to do one’s bidding. However, the daemon is capricious, malicious, and above all, the daemon is a liar and deceiver. Many ill-prepared Chaos cults have thought to summon a warp-creature to do their bidding, only to find themselves amongst the fiend’s first victims.

Daemonic summoning rituals are well-known to followers of the Dark Gods, and disrupting such vile rites is a matter of absolute importance to members of the Inquisition and the Ecclesiarchy, lest the denizens of the warp be unleashed into reality to spread malice, horror, and corruption. Among those well-read about the ways of Chaos, many believe it is actually the daemon—more-so than the traitor or the heretic—which represents the true power of mankind's Great Enemy. It should come to no surprise, then, that within the Inquisition the more radical members with especially "flexible" morality view the idea of turning a daemon against the forces of Chaos as a particularly tantalising one.

Even the most well-connected of radical inquisitors would be hard-pressed to conceal the summoning of daemons, to say nothing of their ephemeral nature in the materium further complicating the prospect. Enter the daemonhost—a daemon bound and contained within a human body, enslaved to the will of its creator. Daemonhosts are considered an utter abomination by both the radical's puritan peers as well as the followers of Chaos themselves, and to craft and wield one can easily create a great many enemies of all sorts.

To create such a monstrosity, the radical must procure dangerous tomes full of the most proscribed knowledge, as well as a victim to serve as a host. These actions alone would be enough to condemn them unto death and damnation in the eyes of many within the Inquisition. However, censure by their peers is likely the lesser of the two dangers the radical will face. No daemon will suffer the yoke of a mortal master willingly, and without fail they will prove to be duplicitous and manipulative servants. Controlling a daemonhost is a constant struggle between master and slave, with the slave looking for any excuse to cause its master misfortune—or simply rend him limb from limb, should the opportunity arise.

This leads to the radical’s most dangerous dilemma. The bindings that trap the daemon within its host and force it to obey its master also limit the power it can wield. Therefore, the stronger a radical wishes his daemonhost to be, the weaker he must bind it to his will.
### **Instruction in the Malefic**

The knowledge of how to create a daemonhost is difficult to acquire. Besides being considered heresy of the highest order by the Imperium (outside the Inquisition, one could be executed for even knowing of the existence of such abominations), the information is simply not widely known and even less widely distributed. Devotees of the Ruinous Powers often prefer to unleash the pure chaos and destruction of an actual daemon made manifest, while those who require something marginally more "predictable" are wont to create daemon engines, heavily-armed war machines animated by a bound daemon's endless thirst for violence and suffering. It is, therefore, largely a body of work penned by those insane enough to think they could harness the power of the warp for purely personal gain, or even more naively, for the "betterment" of their fellow man.

A scant few tomes do include detailed—and relatively reliable—instructions. These books are filled with malefic and daemonic lore, and are often very rare and very, very old. Some may have even been inscribed prior to the God-Emperor's enthronement on Holy Terra. Once such a fell volume has been obtained, the radical must then procure a host—a human vessel to act as the daemon's corporeal form and thus its anchor within the materium. Although no two sets of instructions for creating daemonhosts are the same, each will inevitably require a living, human victim to serve as the host. Normally, one cannot create a daemonhost by binding a daemon within an animal or a corpse. If there are more specifications describing a suitable victim (such as male, female, pure of soul, of a certain age, and so forth), they will be described in the instruction set.
### **Proscribed Works**

A book that would contain instructions for binding a daemonhost is never simply sold on the market. Even incomplete copies are extremely rare and of great value to those that covet such terrible secrets. Obtaining one could be an adventure in and of itself, requiring daring or dastardly deeds (or both) and a great expenditure of both time and Thrones to procure.

The Inquisition of the Calixian Conclave knows of two tomes written in the Calixis Sector’s dark past, the *Occultus ad Oculos* and the *Folio Diabolicus*. The originals are widely believed to have been destroyed by Saint Drusus’s own hand during the Angevin Crusade, but in truth an unfortunate number of copies have survived in dark corners of the sector to this day.

The *Folio Diabolicus* is actually a collection of works by different authors (likely malefic scholars and warp-dabblers), and contains a great deal of information pertaining to summoning and congressing with daemons. The book is traditionally bound with human leather and penned in blood, giving it an appropriately vile appearance. One of its chapters details several procedures and rituals for binding daemonhosts. Others cover more traditional summoning rites, treatises on the natures and types of daemons from the perspective of Imperial scholarship, and the fundamental forces behind manipulating the warp for one's own gain. 
* The *Folio Diabolicus* is an extremely dense volume to say the least, and the mind-bending nature of its content demands a lengthy period to review. An Acolyte would need to spend at least 1d10+5 days in study to consume the knowledge contained within, during which time they gain 3d10 Corruption Points and, if the Acolyte meets the prerequisites, the [Sorcerer Talent](sorcery.md#sorcerer) as well. After thorough review, the Acolyte will now possess the necessary knowledge to create a daemonhost.

The *Occultus ad Oculos*, on the other hand, appears to have been written by a single individual. It is written in the deepest vaults of the Inquisition fortress on Scintilla that the original book was perfectly innocuous, a small, hardcover tome with no indication of the secrets it contained. The copies found in the Sector since then have followed this tradition. Between the pages exists a detailed and strangely lucid account on the nature of the warp and its inhabitants. The book does not describe sorcerous spells or diabolic summonings, but does detail the procedures for binding warp-denizens within human hosts. The text is strangely straightforward and clear, with an unusual lack of pomposity or dramatic language, as if its writer intended the study of the warp to have no greater portents than preparing vatcakes for a meal.
* Reading *Occultus ad Oculos* takes 1d5 days' worth of study, during which time its clinical and sanitary depictions of warp horrors still inflict 1d5 Corruption Points on the reader. Reading the entire volume grants the Acolyte all the necessary knowledge to create a daemonhost. A subsequent review of *Occultus ad Oculos* grants the reader a +30 bonus to a single Forbidden Lore (Daemonology, Mutants, or Warp) Test, but the reader also gains 2 Corruption Points each time they draw upon the tome's knowledge in this way.
### **Vile Craftsmanship**

Once the pieces are in place, there are two steps to creating a daemonhost. First, the actual bindings detailed in the instruction tome must be applied to the victim’s body. This is done by inscribing the wards and phrases of containment directly onto the skin. The inscribing can be done in simple ink—although considering the terrible consequences should the wards have even the slightest flaw, most prefer a medium that cannot be carelessly smeared or altered, such as tattoos or scarification. Once this is done, additional bindings such as sanctified chains and locks, purity needles, and sigils of authority are added to the victim's form as well.

The entire process is usually quite detailed and time-consuming (although under duress, it can be accomplished quickly. Such sloppiness often leads to unpleasant results). An Acolyte can expect the procedure to take at least a full day, especially if the wards are etched into the skin, rather
than drawn. Unless the soon-to-be host is somehow a willing participant in this process, the victim would almost certainly need to be sedated or restrained throughout the procedure. At the end of the process, the GM should make a secret Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test for the Acolyte overseeing the procedure. The base difficulty of the Test depends on how many levels of binding the Acolyte wants applied to the future daemonhost:

* Unbound: Ordinary (+10)
* Once-bound: Challenging (+0)
* Twice-bound: Difficult (–10)
* Thrice-bound: Hard (–20)

If the Test is made successfully, the bindings have been wrought correctly, and the daemonhost, once created, will have the appropriate level of binding. However, if the Test fails, and for every further degree of failure, minuscule flaws render the bindings one degree less than the Acolyte
intended—thrice-bound becomes twice-bound, twice-bound becomes once-bound, and so forth. An umodified roll of 100 means that a vital piece of the bindings is missing, and the daemonhost will always count as unbound. The GM should keep the results of the roll secret from the Acolytes, as there is no way to accurately determine the how well the bindings will work until the daemon is summoned. Regardless of whether or not the preparation of the bindings was successful or not, every participant in applying them to the victim gains 1d5 Corruption Points.

The next step is to summon the daemon that is to be bound to create the daemonhost. If the Acolyte has read the *Folio Diabolicus*, or otherwise had prior knowledge of the fell rituals used to summon daemons, he need only complete the appropriate summoning ritual to draw forth the desired daemon from the warp. The Acolyte must then perform a [Ritual of Binding](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#ritual%20of%20binding), as if he was attempting to create a daemon engine, but with the unfortunate victim intended to serve as the host as the target. Utilising the instructions from the texts to create the ritual and having the prepared host means the Acolyte must "only" succeed on a **Very Hard (–30) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) Test**, which is modified by **[Table: Ritual Modifiers](rituals%20and%20daemonology.md#using%20rituals%20in%20games)** as usual. Regardless of whether the ritual is successful or not, any characters involved with the ritual (including the victim) gain 1d10 Corruption Points.

Assuming the Test is successful, there is a flash, a deafening crack, and a sudden stench of ozone as the daemon's corporeal form vanishes and an unholy light appears in the victim's eyes—the daemonhost has been created. As the Acolyte recovers from the cost of the Ritual of Binding he now discovers the strength of his bindings (the GM reveals the secret Forbidden Lore Test result from before). As long as the daemonhost is at least once-bound there is no immediate danger, but if the daemonhost is unbound it is completely unconstrained by the Acolyte's orders. The unbound daemonhost is likely to lash out at the fools who summoned it, along with anyone else in the vicinity, before departing to go spread misery and horror for as long as its host body lasts. If the daemon is particularly clever or vindictive, however, it may feign loyalty to its "master" until an opportune moment arises to betray them.
#### **Generating the Daemonhost**

Assuming a human form somewhat alters the daemon's Characteristics and Traits. 

* The daemon's Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship Characteristics are unchanged. 
* For each level of binding, the daemon reduces its Strength and Agility by 1d5 each, as the bindings tend to interfere with its raw power and physicality. At the same time, they also offer some protective value and harden the host's body against Damage, increasing the daemonhost's Toughness and Wounds by 1d5 each as well. For example, a twice-bound daemonhost would reduce its Strength and Agility by 2d5 while increasing its Toughness and Wounds by 2d5.
* The daemonhost gains a number of strange and unnatural mutations and disfigurements as the host's body is hideously defiled by the malignant warp energy of its daemonic occupant. The binding strength has a pronounced effect on this, with greater levels of binding reducing the level of corruption the host body is exposed to. An unbound daemonhost will most likely appear disgustingly mutated and monstrous, whilst a thrice-bound daemonhost could retain most of its host's looks save for the amulets, chains, and sigils etched or inscribed on it. Consulting **Table: Unholy Changes**, an unbound daemonhost gains 1d5+1 changes, once-bound gains 1d5, twice-bound gains 1d5–1 (minimum one), and thrice bound gains 1d5–2 (minimum zero). These may be determined randomly by rolling on the table, or the GM could choose to assign changes appropriate to the daemon that was summoned.
* The mere presence of this unholy amalgamation of daemonic essence and living flesh causes reality to protest around it. In addition to the effects of the Daemonic Presence Trait, the daemonhost produces a number of minor but very noticeable psychic disruptions in the nearby area. All characters and creatures subject to the daemonhost's Daemonic Presence experience these phenomena. As with Unholy Changes, the strength of the daemonhost's binding determines how pronounced these disruptions of the materium are. Consulting **Table: Daemonhost Phenomena**, an unbound daemonhost causes four phenomena, a once-bound daemonhost causes three, a twice-bound daemonhost causes two, and a thrice-bound daemonhost causes one. These may be determined randomly by rolling on the table, or the GM could choose to assign phenomena appropriate to the daemon that was summoned.
* The daemonhost possesses any Psychic Powers it had while it was a daemon. An unbound daemonhost has the same Psy Rating it did as a daemon, with each level of binding reducing its Psy Rating by 1 (to a minimum of 2).
* The daemon keeps all Skills and Talents it possessed. Unless the GM considers them to be thematically appropriate to the daemonhost's new form, it loses all its existing Traits except for [Daemonic](traits.md#daemonic), replacing them with [Dark Sight](traits.md#dark%20sight), [Deadly Natural Weapons](traits.md#deadly%20natural%20weapons), [Fear (4)](traits.md#fear%20%28X%29), [Flyer (Agility Bonus)](traits.md#flyer%20%28X%29), and [From Beyond](traits.md#from%20beyond). Notably, without the [Warp Instability Trait](traits.md#warp%20instability), the daemonhost may remain in the materium indefinitely, and cannot be easily banished—only destruction of the host's body or an exorcism can end the monstrosity's existence.
##### **Table: Unholy Changes**
Beneath the chains, amulets and talismans, and tattooed and etched sigils of binding, a daemonhost's body is warped by the terrible energies contained within it. The weaker its binds the greater the daemonhost's power, and consequently greater mutation the host body is subjected to. An unbound daemonhost has 1d5+1 changes, a once-bound daemonhost has 1d5, a twice-bound has 1d5–1 (minimum one), and thrice bound has 1d5–2 (minimum zero).

| Roll  | Unholy Change Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–04 | **Vestigial Horns:** Two small horns protrude from the daemonhost's forehead, a subtle sign of the fiendish nature of what lies beneath.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 05–08 | **Glowing Eyes:** The daemonhost's eyes burn with a bright, malignant light that seems to dim and flare in time with the abomination's mood and vigour.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 09–12 | **Festering Skin:** The flesh of the daemonhost is covered with weeping boils and sores. The daemonhost doesn't appear bothered by this in the least.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 13–16 | **Cat's Eyes:** The daemonhost's eyes are yellow with sinister black slits, and its personality becomes subtly predatory in nature.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 17–20 | **Horns:** A great set of ram's horns spring from the daemonhost's head. It gains an additional Natural Weapon attack when making a [Multiple Attacks](combat.md#multiple%20attacks%20%28full%20action%29) action.                                                                                            |
| 21–24 | **Claws/Blades:** The daemonhost's fingers sprout wicked talons or fuse into blades as sharp as sin. Its Natural Weapons gain the [Warp Weapon](traits.md#warp%20weapon) Trait.                                                                                                                               |
| 25–28 | **Broken Form:** The daemonhost's body is unnaturally contorted or folded, moving in a decidedly unsettling manner that no living mortal possibly could.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 29–32 | **Snake Tongue:** A long forked tongue flicks from between the daemonhost's teeth. It is even more deceitful and treacherous than most.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 33–36 | **Fluid Form:** The daemonhost's flesh flows continually—contorted limbs, screaming faces, and other disconcerting sights press against its skin before being reabsorbed.                                                                                                                                     |
| 37–40 | **Wings:** Great wings of iridescent feathers, membranous skin, or brilliant flame spring from the daemonhost's back. Its Flyer Trait increases to twice its Agility Bonus.                                                                                                                                   |
| 41–44 | **Bloody Tears:** The daemonhost's eyes continually weep blood and thin rivulets of gore seep from between its lips.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 45–48 | **Panoptes:** The daemonhost's flesh is covered in leering eyes. It gains a +20 bonus to vision-based [Awareness](skills.md#awareness) Tests and the [Combat Master](talents.md#combat%20master) Talent.                                                                                                      |
| 49–52 | **Plumose:** The daemonhost's body is covered in long avian quills that are surprisingly rigid. It gains the [Natural Armour](traits.md#natural%20armour%20%28X%29) Trait equal to half its Willpower Bonus.                                                                                                  |
| 53–56 | **Flayed:** The host's skin was rent apart, sloughed off, or burned away as the daemon was imprisoned within, exposing glistening muscles and taught sinews. Anything it touches becomes slightly bloody.                                                                                                     |
| 57–60 | **Inner Fire:** Pure warpfire burns within the daemonhost, glowing through its flesh and bones. Its Natural Weapons inflict Energy Damage instead of Impact or Rending.                                                                                                                                       |
| 61–64 | **Corpulent Frame:** The daemonhost is grossly bloated and rotund, gaining the [Sturdy](traits.md#sturdy) Trait and a sinisterly jovial demeanour.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 65–68 | **Snake Nest:** Serpent-like creatures spontaneously flow from the daemonhost's mouth and any wounds it suffers. Targets struck by the daemonhost's Natural Weapons must pass a **Hard (–20) Toughness Test** or suffer visions and delusions the equivalent of a hallucinogen grenade for 1d5 Rounds.        |
| 69–72 | **Infested:** The daemonhost's body is a hive for swarms of tiny biting insects. It gains 1d5 Wounds and all creatures within 5 metres suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests as they are menaced and distracted by the choking clouds of buzzing chitinous bodies.                                                |
| 73–76 | **Corpsehost:** The host did not survive the binding ritual and is now grey and pallid, possibly even rotting. Impossibly, the daemon seems to be unaffected by the death of its host, and is somehow even more resilient! It gains [The Stuff of Nightmares](traits.md#the%20stuff%20of%20nightmares) Trait. |
| 77–80 | **Elongated Limbs:** The daemonhost's limbs are freakishly long and articulate at points a human shouldn't have. It can make melee attacks against targets up to three metres away, and calculates its Movement rates at 1.5 times its Agility Bonus (round up).                                              |
| 81–84 | **Squamata:** The daemonhost's body is covered in hard, plate-like scales. It gains the Natural Armour Trait equal to 3 + half its Willpower Bonus.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 85–88 | **Masqued:** The daemonhost's face is an unchanging, doll-like visage. It can move its facial features normally if it so desires, but its senses are inexplicably unimpeded.                                                                                                                                  |
| 89–92 | **Cinderhost:** The host's body is burnt to a crisp, appearing charred and near-skeletal. The daemonhost is immune to most forms of Energy Damage, though holy fire and the [Holocaust](pyromancy.md#holocaust) Psychic Power still affect it normally.                                                       |
| 93–00 | **In Plain Sight:** The daemonhost appears almost normal, and if its instruments of binding are concealed it could easily pass for a human. This effect removes any others that may have already been applied, and the daemonhost gains the [Disguise](skills.md#disguise) Skill at a +20 as well.            |
##### **Table: Daemonhost Phenomena**
The unholy union between daemon and living flesh causes reality itself to protest the daemonhost's existence. The daemonhost projects the effects of [Daemonic Presence](traits.md#daemonic%20presence) to all creatures within twice its Willpower Bonus in metres, inflicting a –10 penalty to Willpower Tests made within this area. In addition, the uniquely abominable construction of the daemonhost itself inflicts additional phenomena and psychoactive weirdness to all those within the same area. The weaker the daemonhost's binding, the more its mere presence afflicts those around it. An unbound daemonhost causes four phenomena, a once-bound daemonhost causes three, a twice-bound daemonhost causes two, and a thrice-bound daemonhost causes one.

### **The Daemon and I**

In all likelihood, the daemonhost is not a slavering, rabid killing machine, and could well be just as intelligence as its masters, if not more-so. Once bound, the daemonhost follows the instructions of the Acolyte who bound it, and cannot directly harm that person in any way. The daemonhost is perfectly capable of speech, and while its personality is utterly alien, it can maintain a conversation with mortals easily enough. The GM should portray the daemonhost as a named NPC with a persona and demeanour, interacting with the Acolytes and other NPCs whenever it feels so inclined. Depending on the daemonhost's outward opinion of its captors, it may make snide comments and disparaging remarks, or offer ostensibly helpful advice and counsel. 

The Acolytes should keep in mind, however, that the daemonhost will never bear any true love or kindness towards them, and like all daemons, it is a consummate liar that manipulates those around it for sport. At best, the daemonhost views its captors in strictly transactional terms, tolerating them—at least for the moment—as long as the tasks expected of it allow it to indulge in its ostensible desires (usually spreading destruction and suffering). At worst, the daemonhost will actively conspire against the Acolytes, working to harm their reputation and standing with their peers or outright seeking their demise so as to free it from their yoke.
#### **Compelling the Daemonhost**

A bound daemonhost may not directly harm its master in any way, no matter how much it might desire to rend that person to ribbons. However, if its master is weak-willed enough, it is free to ruin his plans, fail to aid him if not specifically ordered to do so, and may harm any of its master's allies or loved ones for no reason beyond desiring its master's suffering. 

When given basic instructions, such as "protect me", or "follow me and be silent", the daemonhost will obey the Acolyte without much trouble. The daemonhost will likely chafe against any specific instructions that aren't in keeping with its daemonic nature, however. In this situation, the Acolyte and the daemonhost must make Opposed Willpower Tests, with the Acolyte receiving a +10 bonus for each level of binding on the daemonhost. If the Acolyte wins, the daemonhost is compelled to follow its instructions to the letter. If the Acolyte loses, however, the daemonhost will still obey, but will take various "creative" liberties with its instructions, almost certainly resulting in more death and misery around it, and very possibly to the detriment of its master.

As an example, a daemonhost is ordered by its master to go into a specific building and kill an individual whilst remaining unseen, but the daemonhost beat the Acolyte in their Opposed Willpower Test. The daemonhost's bindings are absolute, so it must still comply with its master's instructions, stealthily slipping into the building and terminating the target. However, as the daemonhost has not been able to slake its lust for wanton death and chaos lately, and it does not have a particularly positive view of its master, the daemonhost then proceeds to murder everyone else in the building in a spectacular orgy of obviously supernatural death. As promised, no-one saw the daemonhost, because any who laid eyes on it perished promptly thereafter. The Acolyte, however, is now an accessory to slaughter he almost certainly did not want to occur (and possibly subjecting him to a [Fear Test](fear%20and%20damnation.md#fear) if it was gratuitous enough). Furthermore, the scale and sheer depravity of the crime will all but certainly draw the attention of the authorities, who will now be mounting a forceful investigation that is, at a minimum, likely to cause significant complications for the Acolyte's plans.
