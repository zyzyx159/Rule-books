Diviners seek to discern the hidden past and know the course of future events. Their abilities allow them to look into the Immaterium to find the answers they seek. However, this Discipline is not an easy one to master—to look upon the warp is taxing and even dangerous, often leading to insanity and madness. 

"Forewarned is forearmed" is a common expression among diviners, but many find knowledge of the future a heavy weight on their shoulders, especially those whose duties often have them reading dark fates and dire portents of others. Consequently the average diviner is a morose and sullen individual, often resorting to the Emperor's Tarot as a divination tool to disassociate themselves from their own foresight.

##### **Divine Shot**
**Threshold:** 15
**Focus Time:** Free Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

Using this power enables you to make near impossible ranged shots, allowing you to strike virtually any target you can perceive. You must concentrate on a single ranged weapon in your possession—anything from a simple throwing knife to an autocannon would work—before casting your psychic gaze into the warp to search down the near-infinite paths of potential future trajectories that will guide your projectile towards your target. When you find the one you seek, you shoot, and the target is unerringly struck. 

Any target you can see and could conceivably hit with a ranged attack may be targeted with Divine Shot. A target in a crowded, dimly hit hall will be hit, even if you can only see them briefly, whereas a target on the other side of a thick rockcrete wall you are aware of through use of Psyniscience would not. You do not need to roll any Tests to hit, and any Dodge or Parry Tests made by the target automatically fail. Roll Damage normally and, if necessary, roll 1d100 to determine hit location. Assuming you can still see the target at this distance, a target may be attacked with Divine Shot at up to six times your weapon's Range.

Note that Divine Shot only grants you one automatic hit. You may use this power in conjunction with a weapon that can make a Semi-Auto or Full Auto Burst, but you must still make a Ballistic Skill Test as normal to determine if you score any additional hits.
##### **Dowsing**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

By focusing your mind you can single out an object or person somewhere in your immediate vicinity, pushing aside all other distractions until you can unerringly find it. First, choose a single item or person to be the subject of the power. This could be just about anything, but it must be a specific item—you could locate a key to the locked door before you, but not something as vague or general as just "a key". Likewise, when locating a person, you must have either seen them before (possibly remotely or in a pict) or know their name. This power won't allow you to find a victim's murderer from the victim's corpse alone, but will let you track down someone caught on a pict-stealer with a knife in their hand.

Once you have chosen your subject, make a Psyniscience Test. The following factors grant you a bonus or penalty to this roll:

* You are intimately familiar with the subject, such as an object you have been carrying for a long time or a person you know well: +10
* You have a portion of the subject, such as a lock of a person's hair or a stone chip from a statue: +5
* The subject is within 100 metres of you: +5
* The subject is over 500 metres from you: –10
* The subject is surrounded by others of its kind, such as a person in a crowd or a key in a drawer full of other keys: –10

If you pass your Psyniscience Test, and the subject is within a number of kilometres equal to or less than your Perception Bonus, you will have some idea of its location depending on how many degrees of success you scored:

| Degrees<br>of<br>Success | <br>Dowsing Result                                                                    |
| :----------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|            0             | The rough direction of the subject                                                    |
|            1             | The specific direction of the subject and a roughly how far away it is                |
|            2             | The specific direction of the subject and exactly how far away it is                  |
|            4             | A visual image of the current location of the subject in addition to the above result |
As long as you sustain this power you can spend a Full Action to gain updated information on the location of the subject, allowing you to track a person who is actively trying to evade you, or an object being moved on a vehicle. The level of detail remains dependant on your original degrees of success from the Psyniscience Test.
##### **Far Sight**
**Threshold:** 17
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 1km/Willpower Bonus

Some diviners are capable of opening their inner eye to perceive events that occur at places far away from them. Far Sight may be used to make you aware of a single space anywhere within Range of this power. You need not be aware of the destination; you merely need to identify how far away you need to cast your senses (for example: "I look two kilometres to the west"). Should the point you select be inside a solid object, such as a wall, tree, cliff face or the like, the power simply fails. You may use Far Sight to cast your view inside buildings, bodies of water, pockets of gas, and so on without impediment.

Once you have cast your sight to a particular place, you can see up to the normal range of your vision from a specific point of view. You may change your facing by 90-degrees by spending a Half Action. Once you choose your point, you may not select another, and will need to manifest the power again to select a new point. Far Sight does not grant any special forms of vision; if your clairvoyant point is within a dark room, and you cannot normally see in darkness, that darkness is all you will see. Far Sight is only a form of clairvoyance and therefore does not pick up sound, although if you have the [Lip Reading Skill](skills.md#lip%20reading) you can certainly use it in conjunction with this power.

Sustaining this power is extremely disorienting, and your senses can easily become confounded as you perceive two different areas at the same time. As long as this power is active you cannot spend more than a Half Action each Round, and you suffer a –30 penalty to all Tests.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold you can double the Range of this power, from 1km per point of your Willpower Bonus to 2km, from 2km to 3km, and so forth.
##### **Glimpse**
**Threshold:** 18
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

You reach into the warp to grasp a single moment from the possible futures arrayed before you—a moment in which you succeed at a particular task—and the trials and travails that could prevent that moment coming to pass. Unscrupulous psykers have frequently used this technique to perform all manner of illicit tasks, their uncanny proficiency in a vast range of tasks due as much to
prophetic talent as to any mundane skill. 

Until the end of your next Turn you gain a +30 bonus to any single Skill Test, excluding Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill. Fates change quickly, and if you do not act on this power's effect before the end of your next Turn its benefit is lost as the future becomes the present.
##### **Precognitive Dodge**
**Threshold:** 14
**Focus Time:** Reaction
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

Your awareness of the gossamer-thin threads of fate weaved in the warp grant you the means to elude your opponents' attacks without needing to rely on something as unreliable as mortal reflexes. In any situation in which you would be entitled to make a Dodge or Parry Test to avoid an attack you can instead attempt to manifest this power, using your Reaction for the Round to make the Focus Power Action. If you succeed you gain momentary insight on the attack that's about to befall you, along with whatever you need to do to avoid it. You are considered to have avoided the attack just as if you had passed a Dodge or Parry Test. To everyone else—including your opponent—you seem to effortlessly sidestep or duck the attack with astounding grace.

This power does have one notable limitation: in all cases you must ordinarily be able to make a Dodge or Parry Test in the first place, even if the odds of success are very low. No amount of precognition will allow you to throw yourself out of an enormous explosion, and you must be aware of the attack in the first place to attempt a Precognitive Dodge. 
##### **Precognitive Strike**
**Threshold:** 17
**Focus Time:** Free Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** You

Like an Eldar Warlock you read your opponent's movements a moment before they happen, discerning moments of vulnerability and letting you strike with uncanny accuracy. Armed with just this slight foreknowledge, your enemies appear to dodge into your blade or lean out of cover just in time to catch your bullet. Until the end of your next Turn, you gain a +20 bonus to all Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests.
##### **Preternatural Awareness**
**Threshold:** 9
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

Casting your perception from the limited vessel of your bodily senses, you gain an utterly unnatural perception of the world around you. Your eyes roll white within their sockets and your senses roam about, searching for even the slightest disturbance or most minor change. You also gain impressions of future events, granting you uncanny accuracy in anticipating them. You gain a +20 bonus on all Perception-based Tests, and may add your Willpower Bonus to your Initiative count. If you manifest this power after combat has started it may alter the Initiative order if your Willpower Bonus is high enough to put you ahead of the next character.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may add your Willpower bonus to your Initiative again.
##### **Psychometry**
**Threshold:** 16
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You (see text)

Intense displays of emotion leave a psychic "residue" on objects and places exposed to them. Similarly, anything that has been actively carried or used by an individual for a long time will eventually pick up similar psychic impressions. With this power, you can read the psychic traces that others leave behind, giving you images directly connected to the place or object in question. These traces often take the form of sensory data. For example, a diviner may taste the hot blood-tang of murder, or smell the rank sweat-stench of desperation.

You may use this power in one of two ways. First, you may use it to divine the impressions of an object, or, second, you may use it to divine psychic impressions in an area. In the case of the former, you must be handling the object. In the case of the latter, you may divine any pertinent details that occurred within a number of metres equal to your Willpower Bonus.

The quality and nature of the information depends on how long you sustain the power. You derive a new piece of information for every ten Rounds you spend handling an object or concentrating on an area.

| Rounds | Result                                                                                                              |
| :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   10   | You sense the most recent strong emotion associated with the area or object—love, hated, amusement, fear and so on. |
|   20   | You perceive the general features of the person who experienced the emotion.                                        |
|   30   | You get a clear image of the features of the person who experienced the emotion.                                    |
|   40   | You are able to identify the person's occupation (e.g. Career and Rank, if applicable).                             |
|   50   | You are able to discern the name of the person.                                                                     |
|  +10   | You discover an additional fact about the person as determined by the GM.                                           |

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you cut the time required by half: if you exceed the PT by 10 points, you derive a new fact every 5 Rounds; if you exceed by 20 points, every 2 Rounds; and for 30 points, every Round.
##### **Personal Augury**
**Threshold:** 14
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** No
**Range:** Touch

Your gaze is cast upon the infinite tides of the warp, to seek out the future of a single, specific individual. While supposedly something of a staple of soothsayers and other petty seers, it takes real psychic power to gain true insight into what the fate may hold. You may warn the querent of impending dangers and opportunities, or even divine specific advice about a certain situation they face. To begin the augury, you clasp the hands of your client, and ask them to specify a circumstance that they wish divined. This may be as detailed as, "What dangers does the headquarters of the Barbed Chalice hold?" or as vague as, "How can I please my master?" The more precise the question, the more specific the reading may be. Once the question is established, you and your client spend the next thirty minutes using assorted psychic foci—drawing Tarot cards, sifting through the entrails of exotic beasts, casting runes, gazing deep into fire or still water, or any of countless other methods that suit your preferences and the temperament of the warp on that day. At the end of this time, you may make a Psyniscience Test to accurately sense the weave of the client's future. Each degree of success reveals more information:

| Degrees<br>of<br>Success | <br>Result                                                                                                                                              |
| :----------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|            0             | **Doom:** You receive a symbolic warning of the greatest peril or obstacle faced by the target in question. This is a vague hint about what is to come. |
|            1             | **Malign Influences:** You gain intuition of the target’s doom, and a further two negative influences that the target will face.                        |
|            2             | **Benign Factors:** You gain an additional impression of the greatest advantage or weapon the target has in their possession.                           |
|            3+            | **Fate:** You are aware of all the previous effects, and may also offer a single sentence of cryptic or mystical advice to the target.                  |

##### **Soul Sight**
**Threshold:** 23
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You

Diviners are said to be able to read a person's ephemeral aura, the ghost self they unconsciously project into the warp. From observing the nature of this aura, they can learn many things about a person's emotions and feelings: from their current emotions, to habitual moods, to their levels of injury, and even any addictions or madness they may suffer from.

When this power is manifested, you may try to read the aura of any person you can see as a Full Action. This requires a successful Psyniscience Test, with each degree of success granting you more information:

| Degrees<br>of<br>Success | <br>Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|            0             | **Hue.** You focus on the dominant colours in the target's aura. This allows you to detect the strongest three emotions they are currently experiencing. You are also able to detect their race, and if they have any Psychic Discipline Powers, though not what they are. From the brightness and consistency of the aura, you are also able to gain a rough idea of the target's physical and mental health. This does not tell you their exact Wounds or Insanity Points, but rather grants a loose impression (good, poor, slightly weak, and so on). Finally, you may tell whether the target is an Untouchable—these benighted creatures have no aura at all, and further divination on them renders no additional information.                                                                                    |
|            1             | **Flow.** You gain all the impressions of the previous result, and also gain a greater understanding of their emotional state. You can read all of the target's current feelings. You also gain an insight into the target's nature and their habitual tides of sentiment (depressive, misanthrope, optimistic, etc). These perceptions grant you +10 to all Fellowship Tests made against the target whilst this power is active. In addition to this, you can see undercurrents of emotion caused by biological feedback, such as hunger, desire, fatigue, intoxication and pain. You may determine the target's current Wounds and Fatigue levels. Finally, if the target has any Psychic Discipline Powers, you may tell which Disciplines these powers originate from (though not which specific powers these are). |
|            2             | **Shape.** You gain all the impressions of the previous result, and gain a greater understanding of the target's longstanding emotions and emotional states. The aura's connection to the warp around it reveals if the target has any Corruption Points, although not how many. Ripples in the aura reveal the three major emotions experienced by the target over the past twelve hours. You may determine the target's Insanity Points and any madness or addictions they are currently suffering from. If the target has any Psychic Disciplines, you may infer their precise Psy Rating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|            3             | **Pattern.** You gain all the impressions of the previous result, and gain a full appreciation of the target's aura. You may determine the exact Corruption Points of the target. You may also detect if the target has any Minor Psychic Powers (though not what they are). Finally, you may tell if the projected aura is genuine, or has been produced by some unnatural means (Psychic Power, Daemonic ability, technological means etc). Note that you cannot divine what the target's genuine aura should be; only that it is artificial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
You may sustain this power for as long as you wish, waiting to zero in on a specific target or looking for changes in their aura once you do. You may only view a single target's aura, however. If you wish to view the aura of another person you must manifest this power again.
