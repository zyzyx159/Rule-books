“*Sorcery. Of all the black arts, none are so foul as that which give a man the powers of an abomination*.”

—Valran Hurst, Ordo Hereticus Witchfinder

The arduous study and strength of will required to become a psyker of ability drives many who lack the diligence, opportunity or the innate talent, to look for what some foolishly see as an easier path to power and even those with very limited or no latent psychic ability can become powerful sorcerers—if they have the will, intelligence and stomach to wield and pay the price for their dark lore. Despised and feared for their unnatural practices and the taint of the warp that lingers near them, sorcerers are often recluses. Like all who gaze too long at things which man was never meant to see, most sorcerers eventually succumb either to insanity, mutation, or the daemon’s hunger, for there are no more treacherous paths to power known to mankind.
# **Using Sorcery**

Sorcery uses the same mechanics as Psychic Powers. All Sorcery powers are treated as Psychic Effects, and where applicable, Talents, Traits, and specialised defences that protect against Psychic Powers also defend against Sorcery.

All Sorcery powers are divided between the Minor Arcana, which are equivalent to Minor Psychic Powers, and Major Arcana, which are equivalent to Discipline Powers. Unless expressly stated otherwise, a sorcerer must also be able to speak and gesture freely in order to use a Sorcery Power.

The practice of using the dark arts to channel the warp is even more difficult and dangerous than the use of a psychic character’s innate powers, and if the sorcerer incurs any Psychic Phenomena, then he must add +10 to the results of any random effect for a Minor Arcana power, and +20 to any mishap while using a power of the Major Arcana. Note that this penalty only affects Psychic Phenomena; if Perils of the Warp occur, do not increase the result. However, the sorcerer can attempt a Corruption Test to negate the effects of a Psychic Phenomena affecting him directly. If successful, the sorcerer is unaffected by the Phenomena, though it still occurs and may affect other characters normally.

When making a Power Roll, a sorcerer who rolls a 7, 8, or 9 three times (at least three dice must be rolled) arouses a moment of favour with one of the terrible Gods of Chaos. The sorcerer immediately gains 1d5 Corruption Points and gains an additional level of overbleed on the power manifested (if applicable). Even if the sorcerer would ordinarily fail to manifest the power due to failing to meet the Threshold, the power manifests anyway.

The ability to use sorcery is dealt with for simplicity’s sake by a number of special Talents, all of which are found below, along with a number of specific powers available to the sorcerer.

Individuals with the Sorcery talent have access to the Invocation and Psyniscience Skills and may have their own version of the Corpus Conversion Talent as well.
## **Dark Power**

Even a mild flirtation with the abominable powers of the warp will leave its mark on a practitioner's soul. The warp claims those weak of will first, while the strong-minded may be able to withstand its hideous influence—at least for a time, anyway. Those who continue to tap into its energies will eventually be consumed by it. 

Every time you successfully manifest a Sorcery power, you gain a number of Corruption Points equal to 1d5 for a Minor Arcana or 1d10 for a Major Arcana. You may reduce any Corruption Points gained in this fashion by your Willpower Bonus, down to a minimum 0. In addition, each time you gain Corruption Points from Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp increase the total CP gained by 1.
## **Malefic Witches and Warp Tainted Psykers**

“*They’re coming. I know. Horrors. Such visions of death. My mind burns with clarity.*”

—Sebastian Erwin, Declared Heretic 219.33, Executed 231.47

For psykers, the dark arts of sorcery present a deceptively easy path to greater power—but one any righteous servant of the Emperor will rightly abhor. Most witches and rogue psykers have no such qualms, however, seeking out the study of the malefic arts and dark lore to augment their own power, or in a desperate attempt to achieve better control over their abilities—all the sooner to fall, in many cases, for the daemon’s lure.

Sorcery, either as a manifestation of warp taint or a learned dark lore, may be “stacked” with Psychic Powers. If a psyker falls to the temptation of sorcery, make the following adjustments:

* Replace the usual benefits of the Sorcerer and Master Sorcerer Talents with a +1 increase to the psyker's Psy Rating.
* The psyker may now purchase Minor Arcana as if they were Minor Psychic Powers and Major Arcana as if they were Discipline Powers (treat Major Arcana as a new Psychic Discipline).
* Add +20 to the result when determining Psychic Phenomena.
## **Sorcerous Talents**

“*They cannot be stopped. I’ve seen the end. Humanity stripped bare. Piece by piece, a jigsaw unravelled*.”

— (REDACTED)

The following Talents are explicitly intended for use with Sorcery.
#### **Sorcerer**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 35, Willpower 35, Forbidden Lore (Demonology or Warp) +10 or Scholastic Lore (Occult) +10.

The Acolyte may use the powers of sorcery to channel the warp through a combination of esoteric lore, skill and focused will. He counts as having an effective Psy Rating of 2 and receives a number of Arcana "points" equal to three times his Willpower Bonus. The new sorcerer may expend one point to learn a Minor Arcana or two points to learn a Major Arcana.

When choosing Arcana powers, the sorcerer is not bound by a particular type of power (such as the psyker's Discipline framework), as sorcery is a fragmented and contradictory business. Characters, however, can only fill these power slots <span id="page-169-0"></span>by seeking and mastering the rituals independently, either by dangerous experimentation, proscribed knowledge, or dark bargains with insidious powers, and cannot be develop them naturally.
#### **Master Sorcerer**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 40, Willpower 50, Sorcerer, Forbidden Lore (Demonology or Warp) +20 or Scholastic Lore (Occult) +20.

The Acolyte's mastery of the dark arts is great, and he has learned to avoid the pitfalls that beset lesser practitioners of the craft. He may channel far more raw power than most and counts as having an effective Psy Rating of 4, a +10 bonus to Daemonic Mastery Tests, and is immune to the effects of Daemonic Presence. Should the sorcerer suffer Perils of the Warp, he may attempt a Corruption Test to negate any effects that affect him directly. 

Master sorcerers are extraordinarily rare, and with good reason. Few possess the dedication and strength of mind to enact their will on the warp in this way, and most are destroyed before they attain such skill.
#### **Minor Arcana**
**Prerequisites:** Sorcerer.

The sorcerer has acquired an additional Minor Arcana Power over the amount usually allowed; this must be learned or researched as normal.
#### **Major Arcana**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 45, Sorcerer.

The sorcerer has acquired an additional Major Arcana Power over the amount usually allowed; this must be learned or researched as normal.
#### **Sublime Arts**
**Prerequisites:** Perception 40, Intelligence 45, Sorcerer. 

The sorcerer may use his powers without the usual need for obvious vocalisations, gestures, and the like, simply enacting the patterns needed mentally by sheer dint of concentration and unyielding mental strength. However, the Threshold of Arcana Powers used this way is increased by an additional +2.
#### **Fuelled by Flesh**
**Prerequisites:** Sorcerer.

In manifesting their powers, many sorcerers practice some form of self-mutilation in order to further augment and empower their incantations with their own suffering and bodily sacrifice. Each time an Arcana is unsuccessfully manifested, the sorcerer with this talent can opt to re-roll the dice at the cost of inflicting 1d5 Damage on themselves (Armour, Toughness Bonus, and other protections do not apply to this Damage).

An unfortunate side-effect is that it leaves the sorcerer's flesh a mangled mess of cuts and wounds in a state of constant recovery and open to infection. As a result, the sorcerer suffers –20 to resist the effects of diseases and poisons, and if wounded by a Toxic weapon, he suffers an additional 1d10 points of damage with no reduction from his Armour or Toughness Bonus.
#### **Corpus Conversion (Sorcery)**
**Prerequisites:** Willpower 45, Sorcerer.

To the truly dedicated sorcerer, the flesh is a fleeting inconvenience, a transitory shell to contain his glory until he ascends to something greater. Such beings, whether truly blessed by the Dark Gods, or merely insane, are willing to burn his flesh in exchange for power, gathering the corrosive power of the warp and holding it within muscle, bone, sinew and hair until the time comes to unleash it. A sorcerer with the Corpus Conversion Talent may elect to use it before he attempts his Focus Power Test. The sorcerer may gain a bonus 1d10 on his next Power Roll in exchange for suffering 1d10 Toughness Damage and gaining 1 Corruption Point as the energies of the warp poison his body from within.

The sorcerer may elect to gain a number of bonus 1d10s on his Power Roll up to his Psy Rating, assuming he's willing to suffer an equal amount of Toughness Damage and Corruption Points. For example, a sorcerer could gain 3d10 to his Power Roll, but would suffer 3d10 Toughness Damage and 3 Corruption Points for invoking such a heinous amount of the warp's power into his form.
#### **Blasphemous Incantation**
**Prerequisites:** Master Sorcerer

As a realm of coherent thought and tangible emotion, the warp is influenced by the minds of mortals. Using complex formulae and ritualistic incantations to focus and direct thoughts, a mortal mind can exert influence over the Immaterium more easily. However, the tiniest slip in focus and concentration, the slightest mispronunciation in the incantation, can result in the warp being unleashed in a dangerous and destructive manner.

Manifesting an Arcana with an incantation increases the Focus Time by a Half Action, as the sorcerer requires a few moments to speak the required words. Powers for which the Focus Time is a Reaction cannot be used with an invocation. Using an Arcana with an invocation grants the sorcerer a +1 bonus to his Psy Rating. Any result of 91 or higher on the Focus Power Test is an automatic failure that results in Perils of the Warp.
#### **Sacrifice**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 40, Willpower 50, Sorcerer, Forbidden Lore (Warp) +20

The Dark Gods are said to demand blood and sacrifice from their followers, and those on the path to glory are always eager to offer such things in exchange for greater power. For sorcerers in particular, the offering of blood and life allow more ambitious use of their powers. A sorcerer with the Sacrifice Talent may ritually prepare and slay a sacrificial victim (which must be a human or intelligent xenos). It takes a **Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test**, taking 2d5 minutes to prepare and anoint a bound and helpless sacrificial victim. Once prepared, it takes a Full Round action to slay the victim. Assuming the **Forbidden Lore (Warp) Test** was successful, in the subsequent turn the sorcerer gains a +5 bonus to his Focus Power Test, plus another +5 bonus for every degree of success on the Test. 

In addition, should any Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp occur, the effects are focused through the dying victim. Any effects that would normally affect the sorcerer instead cause the body to burn to ash in a blaze of iridescent warp-flame, dealing 1d10 Energy Damage to anyone within three metres of the victim (gaining the Warp Weapon Trait and increasing the area to a five-metre radius if it was caused by Perils of the Warp).
#### **Warped Psyker**
Prerequisites: Psy Rating 2 or Sorcerer, must have gained Corruption Points because of the Perils of the Warp at least once previously.

Psykers who allow the taint of the warp to sink into them skirt increasingly closer to the edge of madness and daemonic corruption at every turn, and have been plagued with dark dreams and nightmarish visions of the chaotic realms beyond. This stain of the soul can have some advantages, however, as it provides a degree of tolerance to the reality-shattering touch the daemon can cause by its very intrusion into the mortal plane. With this Talent, you are immune to the effects of Daemonic Presence.
## **Minor Arcana**

Aside from the specific sorcerous powers presented here, sorcerers also have access to a Minor Arcana equivalent of all Minor Psychic Powers, although they may be known by a different name based on the sorcerer's esoteric studies or the whims of their dark patron. These equivalent Powers have the same Effect, Duration, and Overbleed (if any), but have a +2 Threshold when manifested as an Arcana.
##### **Death’s Messenger**
**Threshold:** 15
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** Self
You tangle the skeins of destiny to deadly effect, causing others to fall before your assaults as if their deaths were preordained. The next attack by the sorcerer that successfully strikes counts as having the Tearing Quality. If it already has this Quality (owing to the weapon used), the attack gains the Razor Sharp Quality instead.  If 10 Rounds elapse without a blow being struck, this power dissipates.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you beat the Threshold, an additional subsequent successful strike is affected by the power.
##### **Flaming Word**
**Threshold:** 18
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** You 
The sorcerer opens his mouth and recites a blasphemous incantation,  using it as a gateway for the fires of the warp. The power inflicts 1d10+3 E Damage with a Pen of 3. The effects of his power extend to a range of 20 metres and possess the Flame Quality. In addition, due to the unnatural nature of the flames, any target that takes Damage from this power is automatically set on fire (see page 210 of ***Dark Heresy***).

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points that this power's Threshold is exceeded, increase both the Damage and Penetration of the attack by 1 to a maximum of +5.
**Special:** The sorcerer may not communicate verbally for one Round after manifesting this power; this may prevent him from casting certain powers.
##### **Mask of Flesh**
**Threshold:** 13
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** Special
**Range:** You
You call upon the powers of the warp to alter your flesh and change your physical identity. This is no mere illusion but an actual physical metamorphosis able to change your facial structure, eye and hair colour, voice, and skin tone, and may even alter your build, apparent age, etc. By using this power in combination with the Disguise skill, specific individuals may be imitated.

The effects of the transformation last up to the user’s Willpower bonus in hours or can be dismissed at any time, at which point he reverts to his natural form. As soon as the sorcerer changes back, he must pass a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1d5 levels of Fatigue from the immense pain and physical strain involved.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points that the power’s Threshold is exceeded, greater changes can be effected (by 5 points, detailed cosmetic changes—gang tattoos, brands, etc.; by 10 points, mass  may  be  varied  by  up  to  50%  or  cosmetic  mutations  imitated; by 15+ points, gender and apparent humanoid species may be altered. However, these changes are merely imitations and offer no biological function, i.e. the sorcerer could appear to be an Ork but would gain no associated Orkoid Traits).

**Special:** If the Sorcerer suffers a Perils of the Warp event while using this power, he gains a random permanent Minor Mutation in addition any other effect (see page 334 of ***Dark Heresy***).
##### **Mass of the Gods**
**Threshold:** 17
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** Yes
**Range:** 20 metres
Invoking an eldritch litany, you thin the veil between reality and the warp, allowing even the least of daemons to scratch and claw and the edges of the materium around you. The distant shrieks and howls as well as the nightmarish images they produce torment all lesser mortals within their reach. Sorcerers who call such forces into being revel in the blasphemy they inflict and the suffering that comes from their presence. Anyone within range of this power (including the sorcerer) with less than 30 Corruption Points suffers a -20 penalty to Willpower Tests. Every time a creature affected by this power fails a Willpower Test, they gain 1d5 Corruption Points for every degree of failure.

**Overbleed:** If the power's Threshold is exceeded by 10 or  more, the sorcerer can choose to only affect his enemies instead of all creatures within range. However, those unaffected will still likely be aware that something is immensely wrong in their vicinity.
##### **Unholy Vigour**
**Threshold:** 14
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** Touch
With a mix of blood and ash, the sorcerer marks a burning rune on the target’s head. Through the rune, the target can draw on unnatural reserves of fortitude. A character marked in this way may re-roll any Strength or Toughness Opposed Tests he is required to make and gains an additional 5 Wounds whilst this power is active. Any Damage that is inflicted upon the subject of this power affects these bonus Wounds first before affecting the rest. The rune will continue to protect the character for 1 hour.

**Special:** Any character whose body is defiled by this unholy symbol gains 1d10 Corruption Points. The sorcerer must have access to a supply of fresh blood to manifest this power. Inflicting at least one point of Rending Damage to a living target, including the sorcerer himself, will usually spill enough blood for this purpose.
##### **Whispers of the Warp**
**Threshold:** 11
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** Yes
**Range:** Earshot
The echoing whispers of the warp amplify your persuasive abilities to preternatural levels. Anyone who hears and understands the sorcerer must pass an **Opposed Willpower Test** with the sorcerer (who rolls once and applies the result to all Tests) or become vulnerable to your suggestions, granting you a +10 bonus to any Charm, Intimidate, or Deceive Tests against your audience.

**Note:** This power is not a true form of direct mind control but can be used to overcome good sense, sow discord, alleviate just suspicion, and stoke the fires of hatred.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points that the power’s Threshold is exceeded, a further +10 bonus to Skill Tests is gained to a maximum of +30.

**Special:** This power requires no gesture or component other than that the victims must be able to hear and understand the sorcerer.
## **Major Arcana**

##### **Absorb Life**
**Threshold:** 21
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** Touch
With an outstretched hand and eldritch witchlight, the sorcerer absorbs the target’s very life force until nothing remains but a desiccated husk. In combat, you must succeed on a Weapon Skill Test to touch the target, who can attempt to evade the attack normally. With success, you inflict 1d5 Energy Damage to the target with no reduction for armour or Toughness Bonus; you regain a number of Wounds equal to the amount of Damage suffered by the target. If this Arcana reduces the target to 0 Wounds he shrivels up into a withered shell and dies.

**Note:** If the target is Stunned, incapacitated in some fashion, or a willing party to your attack, you do not need to make a Weapon Skill Test to affect them. Further, the arcana is considered to have rolled maximum Damage. It is not possible to regain more Wounds than the target has - a use of this Arcana that inflicts 3 Damage to a target with 2 Wounds regains only 2 for the sorcerer.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points you exceed the Arcana's threshold you inflict another 1d5 Damage, regaining an equivalent amount of Wounds as well.

**Special:** Wrenching life force from other beings can have unpredictable consequences. If you regain 10 or more Wounds from a single use of this Arcana, you must succeed on a **Willpower Test** or gain 1d10 Corruption Points. Failure by two or more degrees causes you to gain a random Minor Mutation (see page 334 of ***Dark Heresy***) as well.
##### **Blessing of Change**
**Threshold:** 28
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** 10 metres
You focus your will and wrath into a searing wave of warp flame that reduces your enemies to iridescent ash, or worse, twitching masses of mutating gore. Make an **Opposed Willpower Test** with your target. If you succeed, this Arcana inflicts 1d10 E Damage +1 additional Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus which is not reduced by the target's armour or Toughness Bonus. Additionally, the target must immediately succeed on a Toughness Test with a -5 penalty for every point of Damage suffered. Failure causes the target to gain 1d5 Corruption Points for every degree
of failure. If the target fails by five or more degrees, he swiftly succumbs to catastrophic mutation and collapses into a grotesque Chaos Spawn.

**Special:** This Arcana has no effect on targets that are not living creatures.
##### **Bolt of Truth**
**Threshold:** 22
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** 5 metres × Willpower Bonus
Use this power to hurl a burst of raw destructive energy channelled from the warp at your victim, burning and blasting him apart. Test Ballistic Skill to strike the target as normal for a ranged attack. If you succeed, your attack deals 1d10 Energy Damage +1 additional Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus. This Damage is counted as having the Warp Weapon quality and so will bypass most armour and defences.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points that the power’s Threshold is exceeded, deal 1d10 additional Damage.
##### **Call of Unlife**
**Threshold:** 28
**Focus Time:** Full
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** 30m
The sorcerer is able to channel the baleful energies of the immaterium into the corporal form of deceased or crippled targets, transforming them into violent and bloodthirsty ghouls that lust  only for death. Animated by pure power and hatred, these warp zombies shamble forward to sink their weapons into the flesh of the living.

This power is able to affect any dead or dying (unconscious and suffering from Critical Damage) body within its range. A number of corpses up to the sorcerer's Willpower Bonus can be reanimated when the power is manifested, and remain active for as long as the sorcerer sustains the power plus another 1d5+1 Rounds. The zombies will not attack the sorcerer, but are not under his control and will mindlessly attack the nearest living targets until destroyed. If there are more corpses than the sorcerer can affect within the range, the corpses closest to the sorcerer animate first. 

The warp zombies use deceased targets' characteristics, gaining a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill, Strength, and Toughness and halving all other characteristics. The zombies rise with a number of Wounds equal to 10 the sorcerer's Psy Rating and gain the Unnatural Toughness, From Beyond, Fear 2, Dark Sight, Walking Death, and Natural Weapons (hands and teeth) traits. The zombie's Natural Weapons inflict 1d10+SB Impact Damage with the Primitive quality. They can also attack with any available melee weapons, though Exotic and more unusual weapons may be lost to their diminished minds (the GM should decide which weapons are inappropriate). The zombies gain the Frenzy talent and will use it any time they attack a target.

**Walking Death (Trait):** An animated corpse, propelled into life by dark forces is, as might be imagined, quite difficult to “kill”. These creatures do not need to breathe; they do not tire  and are immune to poisons and diseases, as well as many environmental  hazards. They do not suffer the effects of being Stunned or penalties for being injured. In addition, only Critical Wounds suffered to the Head or Body can destroy them—any Damage suffered to an Arm or Leg simply renders that limb useless.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points the threshold is exceeded, the sorcerer may animate another corpse, extend the range of the power by 10 metres, or allow the zombies to remain animated for another 1d5+1 Rounds after they cease sustaining the power.
##### **Chains of Torment**
**Threshold:** 25
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** Yes
**Range:** 20 metres
You make a series of intricate gestures with your fingers while reciting the conjuring words that draws forth hideous warp energies to bind and wrack your enemies. Great long bonds of warp-spawned chains or lengths of barbed sinew erupt from the ground around the sorcerer's feet and shoot forth, winding themselves around any creatures within reach. The chains ensnare and constrict as if they were alive, entangling the Arcana's victims while enervating them with horrible agony. When using this Arcana, you and a number of targets up to your Willpower Bonus must make **Opposed Willpower Tests**. Any taget that fails this Test immediately halves their Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, and Agility Characteristics, and is considered to be trapped as if hit by a weapon with the Snare special quality. The target can attempt to escape the chains' grasp as normal for Snare weapons, but the penalty to their Characteristics continues for as long as the sorcerer sustains the power. If the distance between the sorcerer or any ensnared targets increases beyond the Arcana's range then the binds crumble or rot away, ending its ongoing effects immediately.

**Special:** If the sorcerer exceeds the arcana's threshold by 10 points or more then twice as many targets are attacked by the chains as normal. However, the sorcerer has no control over which creatures are attacked, which may include his allies! The  sorcerer can choose to stop sustaining the Arcana, but cannot voluntarily fail any Opposed Willpower Tests.
##### **Create Door**
**Threshold:** 28
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** 3m
The sorcerer summons a doorway to the immaterium from thin air. The doorway may be used to transport the sorcerer anywhere he can clearly recall in his mind. The sorcerer’s player must tell the GM where he would like the door to lead; the GM will then set an appropriate Difficulty rating based on when the sorcerer was last in this place, his state of mind, circumstances, and concentration. This will then be applied to the distance-based difficulty described in **Table: Create Door** below. When the sorcerer steps through the doorway, the GM secretly makes an **Intelligence Test** for the sorcerer. If passed, all is well, and the sorcerer arrives at his intended destination. If not, the GM will determine a suitable alternate destination—possibly one the sorcerer would prefer to avoid.

**Special:** Travelling through such a blasphemous portal brings users closer to the horrors of the warp than it is safe to tread. Anyone passing through the door must pass a **Hard (–20) Willpower Test**. If the Test is failed, then that character must roll on the Perils of the Warp table just as if they had manifested a Psychic Power. Allies (or enemies...) in direct contact with the sorcerer may travel through the doorway as well, though they gain 1d10 Insanity Points as the madness claws at them with even greater force.

| Table: Create Door          |                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Distance**                    | **Test Difficulty**  |
| Up to 100m                  | Ordinary (+10)   |
| 101 to 1000m                | Challenging (+0) |
| Anywhere on a Planet        | Difficult (-10)  |
| Anywhere within a System    | Hard (-20)       |
| Anywhere within a Subsector | Very Hard (-30)  |
| Anywhere within a Sector    | Arduous (-40)    |

##### **Daemon Wrack**
**Threshold:** 23
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** Yes
**Range:** 50 metres
By weaving a pattern of warp energies, the sorcerer may attempt to repel or ensnare and seize command of daemonic entities. After successfully using this power, the sorcerer may take an **Opposed Willpower Test** to inflict Malediction on a targeted daemonic creature. Alternatively, if the daemon has a Willpower Characteristic of 50 or less, then the sorcerer may force a Daemonic Mastery Test to control it instead.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points that the power’s Threshold is exceeded, add +10 to the Opposed Willpower and Daemonic Mastery Tests to a maximum of +30.

**Special:** This power only affects entities with both the Daemonic and Warp Instability Traits.
##### **Empower Weapon**
**Threshold:** 20
**Focus Time:** Half
**Sustained:** Yes
**Range:** You
By weaving a net of malicious warp energy around a gun, the sorcerer can alter the functionality of its parts to drastically improve its killing power. These dramatic effects are obvious at once, and may include the gun sprouting additional barrels, suddenly being festooned with gnashing teeth or glaring eyes, or otherwise being surrounded by purple flames or crackling warp power.

The sorcerer chooses one ranged weapon he is currently carrying and, as long as he sustains this Arcana, may apply one of the following effects to it:
* The weapon gains one of the following Special Qualities, as chosen by the sorcerer: Accurate, Blast (1), Scatter, Shocking, Smoke, Snare, Tearing, Twin-Linked.
* The weapon doubles its Range.
* The weapon's clip refills as fast as it is depleted; the Damage type changes to Energy.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points the threshold is exceeded, the sorcerer may apply an additional effect on the same weapon.

**Special:** Channelling baleful warp power into a gun can have catastrophic effects on its physical integrity as well as machine spirit. Every 7 scored on the roll to manifest or sustain this power causes the weapon's quality to permanently decrease by one step. If the weapon's quality drops below Poor it crumbles away in rusty (or rotted...) pieces, taking any ammunition or attached upgrades with it.
##### **Exsanguinate**
**Threshold:** 20
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** 10 metres
You bellow an incantation to the Blood God and snap your fingers at the target, causing his blood to boil and run from his body. Make an **Opposed Willpower Test** against the Target’s Toughness. If successful, the target suffers Damage equal to double the sorcerer’s Willpower Bonus (Toughness Bonus and Armour will not reduce this Damage) and begins suffering from Blood Loss (see page 211 of ***Dark Heresy***).
##### **Gift of Rot**
**Threshold:** 21
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** 5 metres
You utter a praise to the Lord of Flies and offer the soul of your target, inviting a virulent plague upon them as they begin to vomit bile and blood as the skin forms into bulbous pustules. The disease lasts for a number of Rounds equal to 1d10 minus the target’s Toughness Bonus. The target's Characteristics are reduced by 10 for the duration of the Arcana's effect.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which the sorcerer exceeds the power’s threshold, the duration of the disease increases by 1 round.

**Special:** If a character dies while suffering Gift of Rot, his soul is forfeit to the plague god Nurgle. The fallen corpse will decay further and arise as a Plaguebearer 1d5 Rounds later. The Plaguebearer will immediately attack anyone nearby.
##### **Hatestorm**
**Threshold:** 20
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** Yes
**Range:** 30 metres
You beseech the Lord of Skulls to grant you with a measure of his furious power and feel yourself overcome with rage and an overpowering desire to kill. Anyone caught within the range of this Arcana, including the sorcerer, experiences hellish warp echoes that force them into a psychotic hatred of all living things. All characters affected by Hatestorm immediately become Frenzied and remain in that condition until they are no longer within range of the sorcerer or the sorcerer ceases sustaining the Arcana. An affected character who kills another affected character in melee combat immediately recovers 1 lost Wound as Khorne eases their injuries so that the bloodshed may continue. 

**Overbleed:** If you exceed the arcana's threshold by 10 points or more, all characters affected by Hatestorm temporarily gain the Battle Rage talent. Characters who already have that Talent instead gain a +5 bonus to all Weapon Skill Tests.

**Special:** After this arcana ends, all characters who were affected by it must make an **Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test** or gain 1d5 Insanity Points. If they spent more than 10 Rounds (one minute) Frenzied, the difficulty increases to Difficult (-10).
##### **Scintillating Cascade**
**Threshold:** 22
**Focus Time:** Half Action
**Sustain:** No
**Range:** 30 metres
You give thanks to your dark patrons and invoke their names before giving a dramatic sweep of the arm which sends forth a rolling tide of prismatic destruction. Shimmering warpfire filled with the grasping claws and wailing faces of the damned streams out in a 30 degree cone, behaving much like the mundane effects of a Flame weapon. This Arcana inflicts 2d10 + your Willpower Bonus Energy Damage with both the Tearing and Warp Weapon qualities. The Arcana's effects can be avoided normally. Creatures struck by a Scintillating Cascade who survive the attack must succeed on a **Willpower Test** or gain 1d10 Corruption Points from the malign energies washing
over them.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points the Arcana's threshold is exceeded, increase both the Damage and amount of Corruption gained on a failed Willpower Test by +1. If you exceed the threshold by more than 10 points, characters who fail their Willpower Tests also gain a random Minor Mutation.

**Special:** This Arcana is notably less effective against those who have already given their souls to Chaos. A character struck by a Scintillating Cascade can choose to make a Corruption Test, with success allowing them to completely ignore its effects.
##### **Touch of Power**
**Threshold:** 24
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** Yes
**Range:** You
With a growling litany of supplication, you cut the symbol of Chaos into your flesh and offer your mortal form as a vessel for the Gods. A fierce daemon corrupts your body, briefly sharing its power with you. While you sustain this Arcana, your Weapon Skill and Strength Characteristics increase by +20, your Toughness and Agility Characteristics increase by +10, and you gain +3 Initiative and the Natural Armour (3) Trait. Your hands and arms twist and harden into wicked claws while your jaws dislocate and fill with dozens of razor sharp fangs, granting you the Natural Weapons Trait; your melee attacks gain the Tearing and Warp Weapon qualities. You cannot use any other weapons, and neither can you attempt any task requiring patience or fine manual dexterity. The horrid visage of the daemonic influence (and quite possibly your equally horrid actions) reduces your Fellowship characteristic to 10 until the Arcana ends, after which you must succeed on a
**Hard (-20) Willpower Test** or gain 1d10 Corruption Points.

**Special:** Only a fool would expect invoking a daemon to be a charitable relationship. Each Round you sustain this power, you must make an **Opposed Willpower Test** against the daemon (the GM will decide a suitable difficulty). If you fail, you give in to the daemon's lust for violence and  become Frenzied. Failure by three or more degrees allows the daemon complete control over your body for 1d5 minutes, during which time it wantonly slaughters anything and anyone in its path (consider it to successfully sustain the Arcana for the duration). You are fully aware of the daemon's rampage but can do nothing to stop or control it. Afterward, the daemonic influence vanishes and the Arcana ends; the difficulty of the Willpower Test to avoid gaining Corruption Points becomes **Very Hard (-30)**.
##### **Warptime**
**Threshold:** 26
**Focus Time:** Full Action
**Sustain:** Yes
**Range:** You
You open your arms and call down the power of the Gods, the intractable nature of the warp allowing you to defy the normal limits of time and space. This insidious conduit to the immaterium empowers your body with a fierce and terrible energy, granting you the otherworldly swiftness of a daemon. While your surroundings seem to slow to a crawl, other characters find the sorcerer's  movements to be terrifyingly fast and unpredictable. While you sustain this Arcana, you increase your Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Agility Characteristics by +20.

**Special:** Drawing deeply of the warp's power can be extremely perilous, especially for any protracted period of time. Each round you sustain Warptime, roll 1d10—if the result is a 9 you must roll on the Psychic Phenomena table as if you had rolled that result while making a Power Roll. Further, if you manifest or sustain any other Psychic Powers or Arcana while sustaining  Warptime you must roll on the Psychic Phenomena table and add +10 to the result.
