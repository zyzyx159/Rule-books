*"There is nothing to fear but failure."*

— Warmaster Slaydo.

As your Acolyte undertakes adventures, explores strange environments and exposes villainy, he will engage in all manner of activities. Shooting a lasgun, interrogating scummers in a pound house, scaling a cliff wall, avoiding the power sword of a heretic: these are just a sample of the typical sorts of things your character might face in his service to an Inquisitor. While it might be sufficient to say that you can or cannot achieve these things, ***Dark Heresy*** uses a system for resolving the challenges that characters must overcome during game play.

The basic way of determining success or failure is determined by what is called a "Test". Whenever the action, task or effort could have dramatic consequences—things that affect the story, your character's health and so on—you must take a Test.
## **The Core Mechanic**

Almost all Tests are performed using the same steps:

* Determine the Skill or Characteristic being tested. Each Test identifies one Characteristic or a Skill (which is a Characteristic modified by circumstances) to be Tested.
* Once the Skill or Characteristic is identified, take the value of the Skill or Characteristic. This is a number between 0 and 99.
* Identify any modifiers that may affect the Test, either positive or negative. Easier Tests may grant bonuses to the Skill or Characteristic being Tested for the duration of the Test, while more difficult Tests may impose penalties. In addition, Actions and environmental conditions may impose further modifiers. Aiming a gun before firing it may grant a bonus to a Ballistic Skill Test, while running through deep snow may impose a penalty to an Acrobatics Test.
* Add all the modifiers together. Positive and negative modifiers may negate each other. Once all modifiers have been combined, the character should be left with a final number (sometimes referred to as a "modified total"). This number may be greater than 100, or less than 0.
* Make a percentile roll (1d100). This can be accomplished using two different-coloured ten- sided dice, with one serving as the "tens" result and the other serving as the "ones" result, using percentile dice where one is numbered 10–00 to determine the result more quickly and unquestionably, or even a true hundred-sided die if you happen to have one.
* If the result of the percentile roll is less than or equal to the Skill or Characteristic being tested, after all modifiers are applied, then the Test succeeds.
* If the result of the percentile roll is greater than the Skill or Characteristic being tested, after all modifiers are applied, then the Test fails.
## **Skill Tests** 

Likely the most common sorts of Tests your Acolyte will have to take during play are Skill Tests. Each Skill is governed by a particular Characteristic. To make a Skill Test, add any relevant modifiers to the Skill’s governing Characteristic, then make a percentage roll. If the result is equal to or less than the modified Characteristic, the Test succeeds. If the result is greater than the modified Characteristic, the test fails.

Success is more likely to occur in a Skill Test where the character has training in the Skill. An Acolyte can still attempt a Skill Test with an Untrained Basic Skill, but in such cases, the governing Characteristic is halved (round down). If an Untrained Basic Skill Test involves situational modifiers,
those modifiers are applied after the governing characteristic is halved. A character cannot attempt a Skill Test with an Untrained Advanced Skill. See **Table: Skill Tests** below for an overview on making Skill Tests.
##### Example
*Drake wants to slip past a watchman so he can gain access to a high security area. The GM declares that Silent Move is most appropriate for this situation, which is a Skill governed by Agility. Drake’s Agility is 34, but he doesn’t have training in Silent Move. Since Silent Move is a Basic Skill, Drake can still make the attempt at half his normal Agility, which is 17. Drake’s player makes a percentile roll and gets a 29, which is higher than 17, so the Test fails.*

*The watchman, now alerted to Drake’s presence, hits Drake with a shock maul. Drake has a chance to avoid the attack by attempting a Dodge Test. Dodge is a Basic Skill governed by Agility, and Drake is Trained in Dodge, so he gets to use his full Agility score for the Test, which is 34. Drake’s player makes a percentile roll and gets a 33—a narrow success! Drake sidesteps the attack just in time.*
#### **Table: Skill Tests**

| Type of Skill                                 | Effect on Skill Test                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Untrained Basic Skill                         | Test at half Characteristic (round down) |
| Untrained Advanced Skill                      | Cannot perform a Test with this Skill    |
| Trained Basic or Advanced Skill               | Test at full Characteristic              |
| Mastered Basic or Advanced Skill              | Test at full Characteristic +10 or +20   |
| Talented Basic or Advanced Skill              | Test at full Characteristic +10          |
| Talented and Mastered Basic or Advanced Skill | Test at full Characteristic +20 or +30   |

## **Characteristic Tests**

Sometimes you may want to do something that is not covered by a Skill or which relies purely upon natural ability (using brute force to knock down a door, for example). In such cases, a Characteristic Test is used instead of a Skill Test. The GM determines the most appropriate Characteristic for what you're trying to do, then make a percentage roll and compare the result to the Characteristic. As with Skill Tests, if the roll is equal to or less than the Characteristic you succeed; if the roll is greater than the Characteristic you fail.

**In general, a Characteristic Test should not be used when a relevant Skill Test would cover the action in question, and a you cannot make a Characteristic Test in place of a Skill which you are not trained in.**

It is important to note that despite their names both **Weapon Skill** and **Ballistic Skill** are Characteristics, not Skills.
#### **Table: Characteristic Tests**

| Characteristic  | Example Test                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weapon Skill    | Attack or defend with a melee weapon                           |
| Ballistic Skill | Attack or a clear a jam with a ranged weapon                   |
| Strength        | Break down a door, restrain a captive, push over a Grox        |
| Toughness       | Resist poison, tolerate extreme temperatures, stave off hunger |
| Agility         | Balance on a narrow ledge, avoid setting off a booby trap      |
| Intelligence    | Recall an important detail, identify a familiar face           |
| Perception      | None—use Awareness, Scrutiny or Search Skills                  |
| Willpower       | Resist the effects of Fear, stay awake while sleep–deprived    |
| Fellowship      | Passively make a good impression, inspire confidence           |
## **Degrees of Success and Failure**

For most Tests, it is enough to know whether you succeeded or failed. Sometimes, however, it is useful or important to know how well you succeeded, or how badly you failed. This is particularly relevant with social skills like Charm and Inquiry, as well as in certain combat situations, such as firing a gun capable of full automatic attacks.

Measuring degrees of success and failure is straightforward. Compare the result of your Test with your modified Characteristic score. A result equal to or up to 9 lower than the score is a basic or standard success. A result of 10 lower than the score gives one extra degree of success, and every further full 10 below the score is an another degree of success (20 below is two degrees of success, 30 below is three degrees, and so forth). Conversely, for each full 10 points by which you fail, you gain one degree of failure. If you're unsure if degrees of success or failure are important for a particular Test you may always ask your GM.
##### Example
*Desiring praise and complimentary libations, Father Horst is boasting, none too truthfully, of his success in smiting mutants. He makes a Deceive Test. Since Deceive is a Fellowship-based Skill, Father Horst must roll beneath his Fellowship Characteristic to successfully convince the sceptical enforcers that his actions were indeed "like the Imperial heroes of old". Horst rolls 12 against a Fellowship of 44. Not only does he succeed, he beats his target by 3 degrees of success (44–12 = 32). The enforcers completely believe his tale and decide that, as Horst is such a hero, he would be of great assistance in boosting the morale of the troops suppressing a mutant rebellion.*
## **Extended Tests** 

Some tasks are quite complicated and may take extra time to finish, such as fabricating a weapon or cataloguing a vast data-archive. In these cases, the GM may decide that it takes more than one successful Skill Test to complete the task. This is known as an **Extended Test**. Generally, the Skill in question will describe whether it requires an Extended Test, though the GM may adjust the time represented by each Test depending on what is in fact being attempted.
## **Opposed Tests**

There are times when you'll need to test yourself against a foe's ability instead of a fixed difficulty. This is known as an Opposed Test. In an Opposed Test, each participant makes their appropriate Test normally and whoever succeeds wins the Test. If both parties succeed, the party with the most degrees of success wins the Test. If the number of successes is equal, then the party with the highest Characteristic Bonus wins. If the result is still a tie, then the lowest die roll wins.

Should both parties fail, then one of two things occurs: either the Test ends in a stalemate and nothing happens, or both parties re-roll until there is a clear winner. Either outcome is appropriate, and is left to the GM’s discretion based on the circumstances of the Test being made.
##### Example
*Kiera is trying to sneak out of a cosmoport held by cultists and needs to slip past one of their sentries. The GM calls for a Silent Move Test and opposes it with the sentry's Awareness Test. Both the player and the GM roll. Kiera must roll below 37 and the sentry must roll below 30. Kiera rolls a 24 for a success, while the GM gets a 28, also a success. Kiera beat her number by 13 while the sentry beat his only by 2. As Kiera has one degree of success, while the sentry has only a standard success, she manages to slip past and off into the night to warn her fellows of the cultists' plot.*
## **Test Difficulty and the Role of Circumstance

Not all Skill Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is one thing, but ascending the face of a sheer cliff during a rainstorm is quite another. Both can be achieved using a Climb Test, but the circumstances of the latter make it demonstrably more difficult than the former. The quantifiable question of just how much harder climbing the rain-slick cliff is can be arrived at using **Table: Test Difficulty** and some discretion on the part of the GM.

Sometimes, the difficulty of a given Test is specified by the rules—powering on a vox-caster and using it to contact your allies on the other side of the city is an **Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test**, for example. More often than not the GM will need to determine the difficulty of a Test based on the totality of the circumstances involved. Once the GM has determined the prudent Test modifier, this figure is applied to the player's governing Characteristic associated with the Test before the percentile roll is made.
#### **Table: Test Difficulty**

| Difficulty  | Test Modifier |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Trivial     | +60           |
| Elementary  | +50           |
| Simple      | +40           |
| Easy        | +30           |
| Routine     | +20           |
| Ordinary    | +10           |
| Challenging | +0            |
| Difficult   | –10           |
| Hard        | –20           |
| Very Hard   | –30           |
| Arduous     | –40           |
| Punishing   | –50           |
| Hellish     | –60           |
##### Example
*Vos tries to find the tracks of an unruly feral Grox he is hunting, and the GM calls for him to make a Tracking Test. As Vos is Trained in Tracking, under normal circumstances he'd simply use his Intelligence Characteristic of 41 as his base chance of success. However, the GM decides that the rain last night washed away most of the Grox's tracks, making picking up its trail seriously difficult. He deems the task **Very Hard** and imposes a –30 penalty on Vos' Tracking Test. With the penalty, he has to roll under an 11 (41–30=11) to succeed. Vos rolls a 35, which would have been a success normally, but in this instance the rain foiled him and the Test is failed. To make matters worse, Vos failed the Test by more than 20, so the GM rules that he becomes lost for 1d5 hours as his fruitless efforts to track the Grox lead him far from the trails he was using.*
## **Assistance**

While going it alone certainly allows you to reap a greater part of the glory and rewards of a given venture, it is often not the most prudent course of action if you wish to successfully complete your mission. Indeed, you may find circumstances in a ***Dark Heresy*** game when a task is so great, an obstacle so insurmountable, or an enemy so implacable, that the only way for the players to succeed is to work together, pooling their skills and resources to overcome the matter at hand.

With the GM's permission, a character performing a Test can request the assistance of other characters in the group. When the percentile roll is made, only the character who is actually making the Test rolls the dice, but every other character giving Assistance reduces the difficulty of the Test by one step (see **Table: Test Difficulty** above). Furthermore, if the Test succeeds, the character performing the test gains an extra degree of success.

In some situations, multiple characters working together have a better chance of completing the task than if a character attempts it alone. With the GM's permission, a character can assist another character that's taking a Test. When doing so, the character with the best chance to succeed rolls the dice. Each character assisting reduces the Difficulty by one step. If the Test succeeds, the character who rolled the dice gains an extra degree of success.
#### **Limits on Assistance**

While characters can assist each other in most tasks, there are some restrictions and conditions that should be kept in mind. In all cases, the GM may rule that a certain Test can't benefit from Assistance if there's no reasonable way that having help would substantially affect the outcome.

- To give assistance on a Skill Test, a character must be Trained in that Skill.
- The assisting character must be adjacent to the character performing the Test.
- Assistance cannot be given in performing Reactions or Free Actions.
- You may not assist on Tests made to resist disease, poison, Fear, most environmental hazards, or anything else the GM deems inappropriate.
- No more than two characters may attempt to assist another on a single Test.
##### Example
*Devayne is locked in a makeshift cell and his companion Drake wants to set him free, but the cell door appears to be firmly wedged in place. There is a small window in the cell wall, and Devayne believes he might be able to squeeze through it, but as he is not Trained in the Contortionist Skill he is unlikely to succeed at the Test on his own. Drake is Trained in the Contortionist Skill, so he lends Assistance by talking Devayne through the whole process and assisting him with his posture. The GM declares the normal difficulty for this test is **Ordinary (+10)**, but with Drake’s Assistance, the test becomes **Routine (+20)**. Furthermore, if Devayne succeeds at the Test, he will automatically gain an extra degree of success.*
