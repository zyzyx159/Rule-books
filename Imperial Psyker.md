Imperial Psyker*"Imagine knowing there was a door to the realm of Daemons, and the slightest inattention on your behalf would see them batter it down and rip you to shreds. Now imagine that door is inside your head. That's what being a psyker is like."* — Castus Lupa, Savant Adjunct.

N No one knows when the first human psykers appeared; that information has been lost to the ravages of time, but one thing is certain, their emergence changed the fate of mankind forever. Psykers are both the greatest boon and curse that has afflicted humanity. The Emperor Himself is the most powerful psyker the human race has ever seen. Even ten thousand years after the Emperor was inducted into His sarcophagus, psykers continue to fuel the Imperium. Each day, innumerable souls are shipped to Terra in the Black Ships of the Inquisition. Once there they have the honour of becoming one with the Emperor's Golden Throne, thus allowing His light to spread across the galaxy that the Imperium may endure.

Despite the benefits they bring to the Imperium, an undiscovered or unsanctioned psyker can place entire populations and planets in danger. Psykers' essences glow brightly in the warp, like bait on a line, and they draw malignant entities to that glow. Psykers weak in mind or untrained in protective arts can be easily tainted, and in the worst cases possessed by Daemonic entities and used as a gateway between realspace and the warp.

The psykers who are traced and gathered upon the foreboding Black Ships of the Inquisition suffer one of two fates. The first, and most likely, is after meticulous mind-scanning they are found to be lacking the talent or strength of mind to serve in any other capacity and so are sent to worship at the Golden Throne. The minority who do pass the rigorous sanctioning tests are reprieved and selected to serve the Imperium in some other vocation. Some will serve the Adeptus Astra Telepathica as an Astropath. An even smaller minority—after close scrutiny—are sent out to fill numerous roles throughout the Imperium. This could be as indentured servants to high-ranking lords within the Administratum, battlefield psykers used to counter xenos mystics, or in the service of the Inquisition. Even at such an elevated state, an Imperial psyker, whether he is aware of it or not, is always monitored, for no matter how exhaustive the training, a psyker's soul flickers brightest in the warp.

Psykers have always been used as agents for the Inquisition. Their abilities vary from prognostication, to telepathy, to pyromancy and telekinesis, amongst many others. A psyker Acolyte is most likely still discovering his powers and as he progresses, so he can go deeper and unlock latent abilities and more fearsome powers. The Inquisitor and his fellow Acolytes are both the guide and possible executioner, because as more power flows to the psyker, so too does the lure of Chaos and the attention of Daemons who lurk hungrily in the warp.

# **Scholar Obscurus Advances**

*"You talk to him, but he don't answer. You can feel him rummagin' in your thoughts right enough though. Put me off my gruel, it can."*

Abandoning the petty realm of human knowledge, the Scholar Obscurus studies the wisdom and folly of the human spirit. Steeped in forgotten lore and constantly muttering catechisms and charms against the creatures of the warp, these psykers grow strange and distant.
