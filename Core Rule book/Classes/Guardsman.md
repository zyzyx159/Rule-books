*"We go in, kill anything that moves and then blow the structure with a demo charge."*

— Eli Plex, Assault Veteran of the Secondus 21st.

N No matter how subtle the Acolytes may go about their investigation, at some point talking, stealth, and the use of cunning cease and the need for sheer brute force will be called upon. This is the Guardsmen's role. They are a tough, ruthless bunch, experts in field craft and various ranged weaponry—anything from the humble lasgun to the sophisticated sniper rifle.

Known as the Hammer of the Emperor, the Imperial Guard is the largest fighting force in the history of the galaxy. It is made up of billions upon billions of soldiers, all recruited from the many worlds of the Imperium. The Departmento Munitorum is tasked with supervising, supplying and sourcing the regiments of the Imperial Guard but even this organisation has no idea of exactly how many troops are under arms as the continuous toll of casualties and influx of recruits will run into millions in a single day. The Guard regiments come from many different planets and their native cultures, style of dress, technological background and warrior traditions are all different too. The Guard does not even try to impose a standard uniform, preferring to exploit the unique strength of each company, be it a tribal warrior clan, or a highly drilled and regimented unit of Cadians. To this end there is no formal training; each regiment is trusted to instruct their own troops in the war craft they have developed in their own culture. In fact, the only kind of unity within the Imperial Guard is the use of standard equipment such as the lasgun.

It is from this vast army that Inquisitors will recruit the muscle they often need to go about their duties. Because each regiment is so different, a Guardsman can vary wildly—some are professional, elite stormtroopers; others could be hardened gangers from murky industrial worlds, most likely already killers before even being inducted into the Guard; others still could be axewielding, blood-drinking savages from a far-flung feral world.

Inquisitors will second Guardsmen mainly for their combat experience and expertise with weapons, although their choice may often be influenced if the would-be Acolytes have a secondary set of skills—albeit with a battlefield application. For instance, Guardsmen are frequently trained to be able to drive and maintain vehicles, may have triage and medical expertise or even be competent in the use of communications equipment.

Not all Guardsmen—or the role the Inquisitors define by that label—actually come straight from the Imperial Guard. Some may have crossed paths with the Inquisitor as hired thugs for another agency. Some are wayward mercenaries who have spent their lives as a hired gun, only to be pressed into service of the Inquisition. Others still are hive gangers that may have had the gall to ambush an Inquisitor on his rare travels into an underhive. No matter what the origin, a Guardsman's role within the cell is always that of combat and fire-control.

Captains command large formations and battle groups. The skill of a bold Captain is vital to any successful attack or defence.

# **Marksman Advances**

Most Imperial forces include a Marksman to support the rest of its members with accurate long-range fire support. They are adept at digging in and picking off the enemy.

#### **Storm Trooper Advances**

*"Storm troopers? Them thronegroaning glory boys get all the prime action—and all the credit, too. Don't listen to the propaganda it's us regular Guard that does all the grit-work."*

Storm Troopers create utter destruction. Often regarded by the regular Guard as vain parade apes, they nonethe less have a well-deserved reputation for being the best of the best.

# **Commander Advances**

*"Men of the Imperium stand tall, for you are the favoured of the Emperor!"*

Commanders control the entire flow of battle, from planning to execution. Imperial Commanders have at their disposal the greatest armies in the known galaxy, and the cold, hard determination to use them.

# **Sniper Advances**

*"There's something really satisfying about making a man's head explode like a blood melon. All in the name of the Emperor of course."*

Snipers are masters of their art, able to kill at a distance, then melt away from view. They are silent, skilled and often have a grim sense of humour. Many find them hard to understand.
