— Repeating transmission, overwhelming all signal channels. The annihilation of House Caloclast, Hive Tarsus.

Although all initiates of the Machine God are versed to some extent in conflict and the skills of warfare, certain Mechanicus sects and military formations exist to study the art of destruction with the ardent fervour that their fellows might apply to the creation of machinery or the recovering of lost technoarcana. Chief among these in the Calixis Sector are the forces of the Auxilia Myrmidon, also known by some as the siege engineers or war-savants. Legend has it they came to the sector during the earliest days of the Angevin Crusade for reasons of their own, and have since remained to defend the Cult Mechanicus's possessions here. Myrmidons are expert killers, weapon masters and destroyers. At the behest of the ruling Archmagos of the Forge Worlds, they are sent to accompany explorators in investigating finds in the most dangerous sectors of space and retrieve the most hazardous xenos-specimens, while others are tasked to hunt down renegades accused of the foulest techno-heresies and terminate them with extreme prejudice.

Tech-priests who devote themselves to battle are often inducted into one of the militant sects as their knowledge and prowess increases over time, either through their own application or the will of their distant Archmagos masters. The first rank of the Mechanicus militant is the Secutor, an ancient designation believed to date back, like much of the Auxilia's organisation and secrets, to the armed forces of the Mechanum of Mars in distant pre-Imperial antiquity. It is a fact that only adds to their mystery and makes them a subject for some concern to those in the Adepta whose arcane knowledge stretches to understand what this implies. Certainly this conclusion is backed-up by the ancient and terrifying weapons, relics of that distant past which they are known to sometimes employ.

Within the Calixis Sector, the undisputed centre of the Auxilia Myrmidon's power is the Lathe System and its vast forge network, and in particular their heavy fortified arsenal and base on the city-sized panopticon orbital station. From this mustering ground, the relatively few Myrmidons are dispatched in small bands to oversee the defences of the Mechanicus's domains, seek out and destroy their enemies. The Myrmidons, although largely independent, are closely linked to the Archmagos of the Lathes, who is one of their guarantors of their dominance.

They are not, however, the only militant Mechanicus faction in the sector, and over the last century a highly mystical tech-sect based at the forge facilities on the death world of Haddrak in the northern rim of the Adrantis Nebula has grown to prominence and increasing power. The Divine Light of Sollex, as they call themselves, are zealots in the Machine God's cause, as coldly fanatic and savage in their way as any Redemptionist of the Imperial Creed. To them, the preservation of the arcane mysteries of the Machine Cult from those who would misuse them are of far greater worth than petty wealth, worldly power or the lives of their fellow men, or even other members of the Cult Mechanicus.

Towering figures of steel shrouded in blood-red robes and bedecked in hardpoint, mounted weaponry of arcane manufacture, the Myrmidons and other tech-priests militant are war makers whose knowledge of the arts of siege craft, weaponry and devastation is without peer. Although few in number, they are baleful opponents to face in battle. Heavily augmented, they are relentless, implacable, and the most powerful among them are all but impossible to kill. Myrmidons are held in no little fear and awe by other members of the Machine Cult, and have commonly subjected themselves to cybernetic reconstruction far beyond enginseers or precepts.

You can find more information on the Mechanicus, their domains and their arms of war in Chapter V. Additionally, membership of the sect of the Divine Light of Sollex is available as an optional starting Background Package as detailed in Chapter I.

#### **Becoming a Mechanicus Secutor**

Some tech-priests are drawn to the path of the Secutor through a fascination with the unique and intellectual challenges warfare provides, while others feel themselves drawn to the intricacies and beauties of creation and destruction, or the sacred art of weaponsmithing. Others simply see this path as a means to an end, either for the protection of the Machine Cult, the furtherance of their own independent researches, or some other, hidden agenda. Regardless of their vocation, a tech-priest skilled in such destructive arts as the Secutor is an invaluable ally for an Inquisitor, and makes for a singularly lethal Acolyte. The only downside to such an association is that the Holy Ordos can never be fully sure where the tech-priest Secutor's loyalties lie—even more so than others of their kind—or what ancient and dark secrets they may themselves possesses.

It is likely, as you spend xp on this Alternative Career, your character will advance several Ranks in the Tech-Priest Career Path. While doing so, you can use the following titles for your Mechanicus Secutor character within the Machine Cult instead of the standard ones listed for the Tech-Priest Career if you wish. After taking these Alternate Ranks, it's best to follow the path of the Technomancer on the Career Progression Table described in Dark Heresy, if you have not yet reached the point of division on the path.

| Rank | Name            | XP            |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| 4    | Secutor         | 2,000–2,999   |
| 5    | Myrmidon        | 3,000–5,999   |
| 6    | Centurius       | 6,000–7,999   |
| 7    | Tribune/ Magnus | 8,000–9,999   |
| 8    | Magos Militant  | 10,000–14,999 |
|      |                 |               |

**Required Career:** Tech-Priest.

**Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp). Other Requirements: WS 35, BS 35, WP 35, any four Weapon Training talents.

Standard Template Constructs

The Adeptus Mechanicus is driven by the quest for knowledge. This quest takes many forms, including research and exploration, but its ultimate embodiment is the search for ancient Standard Template Construct (STC) systems.

These were created during the Dark Age of Technology to provide all the technical information needed to construct anything that settlers might need. Even the least technically accomplished person could build a vehicle, aircraft or weapon given time. One result of the STC system and its pivotal place in human colonisation is that human material culture is very similar, even on worlds which are many thousands of light years apart.

Today there are no known surviving STC systems and only a very few examples of first-generation texts. For thousands of years the Adeptus Mechanicus has pursued all information about the STC. Any scrap of information is eagerly sought out and jealously hoarded. Any rumour of a functional system is followed up and investigated in force.
