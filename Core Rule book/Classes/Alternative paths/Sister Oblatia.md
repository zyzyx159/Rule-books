*"If I must die, I shall welcome Death as an old friend, and wrap mine arms around it."*

— Oath of the Penitent.

For some sisters of the Sororitas, the desire to atone overwhelms them and they take up the oath of the penitent. To become a penitent is to throw aside any thoughts of advancement, self, or any lesser oaths of duty and to seek absolution through a glorious, martyr's death, willingly exiling themselves from their Order and any remaining ties to life in doing so. To their peers these penitent sisters are at once outcasts and revered as something sacred—pilgrims on a hard and noble quest at the end of which shines the pure light of the Emperor's grace. The most famed examples of those undergoing the oath of the penitent are the Sisters Repentia, who, through extreme self-inflicted suffering and the corporal mortification of their flesh, achieve a great and holy rage, hurling themselves with wild frenzy upon the enemies of the faithful, killing in a state of grace until they finally fall.

There are, however, other variations of the penitent's oath, rarer and more unusual but in their way no less remarkable. Once such is the oath of the Sister Oblatia: the oath of willing sacrifice for the sins of another. A sister who takes up this oath seeks not to atone for some direct misdeed of their own, but through profound spiritual conviction to take on the weight of another's sins, most commonly a blood relative, some infamous ancestor or stain on their family line, or, more rarely, for the past transgression of a friend, a people, or a whole world. Although she seeks ultimate atonement by the manner of her death, the onus on her is to atone through her deeds, most specifically in defeating humanities' great enemies—combating and defeating the heretic, the mutant, the witch and the alien without regard to self, injury or hardship. Through the Oblatia's battles, victories and ultimately the manner of their death, they hope to gain for the object of their sacrifice some measure of forgiveness in the Emperor's eyes.

Oblatia are accorded a respectful distance and honoured place in the prayers of their fellow Sororitas. Like the Repentia, they are viewed as pilgrims on a dark and lonely road, but at the end of which lies a shining goal. The Oblatia themselves often seem mercurial compared to other Sororitas, quick to righteous anger, stubborn, independent and brought to a life of endless wandering in search of the foe. Many are led on by the signs and portents of the Emperor's will and others by the divination of His sacred Tarot. Others gravitate towards rumours of corruption, war zones, and places of ill renown. Many, however, find service in the retinues of the Holy Inquisition, where their desire for righteous battle tallies all too well with the Inquisitor's path. But to the Inquisitors who readily employ their zealous fanaticism and undoubted skills to the Imperial Creed, comes the knowledge that their oath comes before any other vow or loyalty.

## **Becoming a Sister Oblatia**

Most Oblatia come to their vows through spiritual revelation or after deep meditation of the nature of their holy vocation, although some few may have the oath in mind as the central cause of becoming Sororitas in the first place. Regardless of reason, only fully ordained Sisters may take the oath, and they must go before a specially convened synod of their superiors who judge the oath's validity and purity of intent, to ensure it owes nothing to hubris or vanity. The Oblatia must then undergo ritual fasting, mortification, and a symbolic severance from her life and Order before taking up the blade and making her vows before the God-Emperor; turning her back on her Sisters as a requiem mass is sung for her as if she were already dead. Most Sister Oblatia come from the ranks of the Orders Militant, but it not unknown for others to undertake the oath, often choosing to put their particular skills to lethal use in tracking down and defeating the enemies of the faith.
