*"Did you receive the heretics into your company? Did you swear to them any service? Did you, knowing that they are the foulest of traitors, aid them by deliberate act, by tolerating their presence, or by the sin of silence when knowing of heresy?"*

— from the Blessed Rituals of Inquiry, Volume IX.

Heresy is most skilled at hiding its face from those who would find it out and persecute it. Conspiracies, cults and false creeds hide themselves behind layers of petty crime, local prejudices, crude fakery, false rumour and seeming foolishness, as well as more labyrinthine plots and intricate layers of well-crafted lies and deceit. Cutting through these distractions to find the truth, no matter how deeply buried, is the trade of the Legate Investigator.

Fully ranked Inquisitors of the Holy Ordos are rare individuals, and in large inquiries or full-scale purges they must often delegate the minutiae of sifting through detail, and the questioning under duress of hundreds, sometimes thousands of suspects to others in their retinue—tasks for which the Legate is exhaustively trained. Gifted with a special seal of authority for the duration of a particular enquiry, these Legates are variously called "cult breakers", "hounds", and "brothers of question" by their fellows in the Ordos Calixis. If an Acolyte makes a particular success of their time as a legate, it is popularly viewed as a sign that the recipient may be headed for an Inquisitorial rosette themselves one day.

The use of Legate Investigators is common amongst Inquisitors, a tradition within the Ordos Calixis since before its formal foundation. To be invested as a Legate is to receive a portion of the power of an Inquisitor, though in a strictly limited and defined form based upon the enquiry they are involved in and for a very limited duration. Such powers usually extend to command authority over local law enforcement, detention, requisition and question, but rarely much further. When an investigation is complete, the authority of the Legates involved is formally ended.

Despite the potential for advancement in the role, some Acolytes see Legates as unfortunate drudges used by their master to plough through tedious months of interrogations and mountains of interminable records, only to find that there is nothing beyond the most minor criminal activity present. Other unfortunates are left to clean up endless loose threads after the main thrust of their Inquisitor's wrath has been expended and they themselves have moved on. This view does have some basis as the Ordos Calixis do invest and dispatch Legates where Inquisitorial involvement is being demanded, but thought largely unnecessary by the higher authority. Some Inquisitors invest Legates and dispatch them on an investigation simply to stir up what may be lurking beneath the mud, using them as literal and open bait to draw heresy and dark forces out into the open—obviously, this last task is far from popular with the Acolytes in question. More subtle Inquisitors use legates to give formal weight to a largely covert operation, knowing that their Acolytes will have access to greater resource without having to wait on petitions to local authority or constantly having to refer back to higher powers.

The granting of even a fraction of the absolute authority of an Inquisitor, even closely defined as in this case, is a very serious matter indeed, only ever entrusted to the most promising and able of Acolytes, and often to candidates who have successfully performed such a role before. Failure or misuse of such an office also holds the distinct prospect of censure and harsh punishment.

#### Secret Tongues and Hidden Ciphers of the Ordos Calixis

The Inquisition has many secrets to hide and many subtle and terrifying tools with which to preserve them. One layer of secrecy comes from the thousands of coded languages and cipher methods used by its servants. Here are but a few of the tongues, ciphers and codes used within the Ordos Calixis.

#### Augustinian

Created by an Inquisitor of a neighbouring sector, this simple series of phrases and pictograms has wide use throughout the Segmentum Obscurus and is part of the so-called Augustine Protocols, a set of Inquisitorial practices and training methods dating back at least four millennia. Augustinian uses phrases and simple hand drawn pictograms to stand for particular situations or threats. "Lidless brother", for example, means "you are under surveillance by other agents of the Inquisition" and can be said, written or represented by its pictogram of a crude eye with a diagonal slash across it.

#### Cryptos Cognos

A relatively recent addition to the canon of Inquisitorial codes, this subtle means of covert communication is based not only on phrases, but voice cadence, inflection and accompanying body language. Exclusively used by graduates of the secretive Tenebrae Collegium, it is so subtle that even sharp-eyed observers could see and hear an entire conversation held on some seemingly innocuous subject and be completely unaware of what was truly being said.

#### The Gimel Progression

Aside from the standard Imperial and Inquisitorial codes, the Ordos Calixis use an ultra-high security cipher for transmissions sent via astropathic chorus, courier and vox. The Gimel Progression varies in security depending on the importance of the message with the lowest being Gimel-Ardent, progressing to Gimel-Amethyst, and finally Gimel-Obsidian. The Gimel sequences are based on seemingly random substitution code words based on a rotating encryption rumoured to consist of all ten thousand volumes of the Codex Administratum and several other noteworthy texts.

#### The Nephilim Cipher

There are some records that are not just secret but dangerous to any that would access them. For such material, a cipher that is not only unbreakable but can also bind what it is used to code is needed. The Nephilim Cipher is one such cipher. It is based on sacred mathematical translations and ancient symbols of binding, most commonly employed to encode material relating to the nature of Daemons and the warp. Legend has it that this code dates back to the very founding of the Holy Ordos.

#### The Tantalus Fractal

Highly unusual, the Tantalus Fractal is a tech-code, a construction of binary incantations and data-djinn locked one on top of another in seven-dimensional formula with potentially infinite combinations and deadlocks. The Tantalus is used by the highest-ranking tech-priests in the service of the Inquisition to encrypt the most dangerous of data, often referring to blasphemous works of tech-heresy and xenos artifice. It is said that the Tantalus holds numerous hidden traps within its makeup more than capable of overloading and destroying cogitators and driving mad or even killing savants attempting to unlock its secrets.

#### **Bearing The Sigil of Question**

All Legate Investigators bear a formal carta of inquiry (their Legature) and a Sigil of Question that demonstrates their remit and authority under the Ordos Calixis. These two things are proof of their authority and status. The first is a document that states the locale of investigation and the focus of concern, granting the bearer the absolute right to question and examine who or whatsoever they wish on presentation and corroboration of a Sigil of Inquiry. The Sigil of Inquiry is an icon made of silver featuring the sign of a chalice engraved with the symbol of the Inquisition. It may be worn as a medallion, carried in a wallet or worn on the finger as a ring, and contains within it a code-key system for verification and secure data-access if needed.

#### **Becoming a Legate Investigator**

Becoming a Legate Investigator is as much about acknowledgement of capability and potential by an Acolyte's Inquisitorial masters as it is a willingness or want on the part of the player or character. The opening up of this Career Rank to one or more members of a group of Acolytes may be a form of reward by the GM for a deftly accomplished mission or successful campaign, or some similar accomplishment. Chiefly, this career shows that a character is both trusted and viewed as capable by their superiors. Whether they live up to such trust is in the player's hands.

Once this Rank has been taken, the character has permanent access to its Advance Scheme, although the Legate's authority only applies for the length of a particular enquiry or mission within the game.

**Required Career:** Adept, Arbitrator, Cleric, Guardsman, or Imperial Psyker.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must have the Literacy skill. In addition, you can only select this Alternate Rank if your Inquisitor offers it to you.
