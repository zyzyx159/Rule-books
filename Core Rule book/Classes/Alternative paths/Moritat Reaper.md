*"I never saw the killer fully, though I thank the Saviour-Emperor for her. We'd lost half the squad and Proctor Aeldred had just gone down with his throat bit open. I fired off the last round from my Puritan and had nothing left but my boot knife and a prayer on my lips when this dark shape dropped from the gantry above. The carrionates, well, the rotted things just came apart, black clotted blood and rancid flesh everywhere. The one in front of me went down in five twitching chunks and I swear I didn't see a single sword stroke fall… a miracle sir. The Emperor's own bloody work—like a death angel from the old hive tales."*

— Deputy Provost Morcar, Report on the Morningside Incident, Hive Gloriana.

The Moritat are an ancient Imperial Death Cult devoted to the art of the blade and their own dark and bloody interpretation of the Imperial Creed. The Moritat's membership view themselves as a sect of assassin-mystics in service ultimately of the God-Emperor Himself, and deem their killings divinely licensed, if not directly ordained. In the Moritat's dogma (as it is with many death cults), blood holds a sacred place: it represents both beating life and the shed blood of the countless millions who have been martyred so humanity can continue to exist. Particularly, it embodies the sacrifice of the Emperor Himself. For the Moritat, then, there is no more sacred act than the spilling of blood and for this reason they prefer to do their work with the edge of the blade over any other implement of death.

Their secret rituals revolve around blood and, to them, no lesson is truly learned and no truth uncovered without bloodshed to mark its moment. Central to the Moritat's doctrine and training is the "travail", the processes of struggle and lethal combat making up the course of their lives and serving to hone their skills. During this time, the Moritat makes their way as a contracted assassin, often only for a nominal fee or a bizarre or symbolic item of payment, or, just as often, as a murderer who seeks out worthy targets among those skilled enough to prove challenging or who they regard as the Emperor's foes—heretics, mutants, cultists and witches, although a particular Moritat has his or her own favoured targets. Many Moritat find service with the Holy Ordos during this period as the goals of the Inquisition and the Moritat's chosen victims marry well together. The sanction of Inquisitorial authority often serves to cover up the assassin's less orthodox habits. The Moritat assassin is watched in secret by members of their own cult throughout the travail and once their superiors deem they have grown sufficiently skilled enough, they are initiated into the cult's higher mysteries, becoming a thing of whispered legend—a Moritat Reaper.

A Moritat Reaper is a vision of death incarnate with a blade, skilled to an extent that few can match: agile, fanatical and merciless. They are also patient, capable of waiting still for hours in the shadows or stalking their prey for days before choosing the right moment to strike. Once unleashed in combat, they erupt in savage grace, their blades leaping, slashing and severing with seemingly wild abandon, belying the consummate precision with which their bloodletting is driven. Once drenched in the blood of their victims, only then is a Moritat satiated and offers up thanks to the Emperor in silent prayer in his or her own cult's tongue, laced, it is said, with a million metaphors of death.

The services of a Moritat Reaper as an Acolyte is a highly valuable commodity in the Holy Ordos of the Calixis Sector, particularly with those who prefer their killings and purges to take the shape of precisely orchestrated strikes and assassinations over public witch hunts and storm trooper raids.

#### **Becoming a Moritat Reaper**

To become a Moritat Reaper, you must have been created with the option of the Moritat Assassin Background Package, (see Chapter I), and this Career choice is designed to be a culmination of that that Origin and choice. Over the course of your adventures, you must also stay true to the Moritat's dogma and defeat several of the cult's favoured enemies in single combat with the edge of the blade.

#### **Required Career:** Assassin.

**Required Experience:** Rank 6: Death Adept or higher (6,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must be a member of the Moritat and remain true to that Death Cult's code.

#### **The Reaping (Talent)**

The deadly fighting arts of the Moritat teach a special manoeuvre only made possible by their near preternatural skill with a blade, allowing one great devastating cut with which several opponents can be despatched in a great effusion of sacred blood.

By taking a Full Action in combat while using a sword or similarly edged weapon, you can make a single attack against every eligible target in close combat with you. You declare which target you attack first and then move in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction (your choice) making an attack against each target in turn. Test Weapon Skill and roll Damage separately. These attacks can be Parried or Dodged as normal, but if an attack is successfully Parried, the Reaping blow is stopped and you can make no further attacks.
