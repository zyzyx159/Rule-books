# Scum

*"You see, you've won again. I told you I was no good at cards. I'll play one more round, but only because you insist."* 
— Reetheus Orl, Barking Saint, Hive Sibellius.

A As has always been the case, the flotsam and jetsam of humanity seems to attract each other and thrives in the darkest of places. The Imperium is a vast and unforgivably hard regime to subsist in, and so the unwanted and uncared for fester and even flourish in the most unlikely and inhospitable places. The underhives, deserted hab-blocks and even entire moons that are now robbed of any valuable resource, hold what the enforcers collectively call scum. They are mankind's detritus, who have no place in Imperial society—even the Ecclesiarchy seems to have given up on them, although some missionaries persist in trying to save their souls, even if their intercession is not requested!

Scum is a catch-all term that covers everything from thieves, Imperial Guard deserters, escaped penal convicts, confidence tricksters, fallen nobles, gangers, murderers, hab-rats and all manner of criminals and unsavoury characters. Despite the collective term, there are many who have skills Inquisitors find useful in their line of work. When an Inquisitor needs someone with low moral values, who will fire upon innocents when ordered or shoot someone in the back without a second thought, it is going to be the Acolyte who has spent his life on the fringes of the Imperial society.

As well as moral ambiguity, Scum often have more practical skills that come in use during an investigation. Breaking in to property unnoticed, finding black market goods, a mark that needs charming or a suspect intimidating are all talents that make the Acolytes' lives easier.

An Inquisitor does not pick just any felon he happens to stumble across to become his agent and to serve as an Acolyte the Scum must be trustworthy—to an extent—and their talents need to be considerable. He needs to be more than just a common ganger. Agents such as this can range from the nimble, double-jointed cat burglar, the fast-talking charmer who can play the long con, the card shark that never loses or the fence with contacts across the breadth of the sub-sector.

Having lived and survived in such tough conditions means that it will frequently be the Scum that is the source of some acrimony and he does not always get on with other Acolytes in the cell. His moral values and reasons for participating may be entirely different from the others and so make him a source of contention. Reasons why such a character may join the employ of an Inquisitor in the first place are manifold: some do it for the sheer thrill, some as sentence for some past crime, some are being paid, whilst others have the skills an Inquisitor needs and so are ordered or threatened to participate. For an Inquisitor it matters little what the motive is, as long as they fulfil their part in the mission. Inquisitors can, and will, use all tools necessary to carry out their duties, they do not care if that is using the highest-born noble or the most inhuman villain—it is the end goal that is important, not the method in achieving it.

## **Dreg Advances**

*"Don't look at the dreg, Tarquis, you'll only encourage them."*

Beggars, thieves and baseborn scum: the dregs of society are nevertheless hardy and surprisingly capable.

## **Outcast Advances**

*"Them cretescreevin Outcast scum would swipe the chronometer off yer wrist as soon as look at yer."*

An Outcast has survived long enough outside the bounds of society to develop a certain rapport with the seedier side of life—as well as an ability to slink into the background when trouble comes their way.

# **Outlaw Advances**

*"Hanging's too good fer 'em. Thrown him to the razehounds! See how he steals with his fingers bit off!"*

A wary creature of questionable, if any, morals, the Outlaw has learnt to fight and run away, to better thieve another day. If society will not provide for them, they are happy to take what they need to survive and law be damned.

# **Renegade Advances**

*"Don't wanna be messing with Renegades m'boy, that's knockin' on trouble's door so as hell an' all will answer."*

Slick, fast and violent, the Renegade knows the basics of the thieving trade, alongside all manner of other dirty tactics. Whether alone or with ganger friends, the Renegade is a dangerous piece of scum.

# **Rogue Advances**

*"There's some as is destined fer greatness… and some fer infamy. Either way, yer get yer face on the pict caster an' pretty young things will be wantin' ta make yer acquaintance."*

Toughened by all that life can throw at him, the Rogue is a smart, skilled and dangerous foe, never to be underestimated, and always to be watched carefully.

# **Cutter Advances**

*"Mark my muzzle, you go there and beg for forgiveness. If Lex sends a Cutter on you, there ain't a place in this hive or the next that'll take you in or save you."*

A bladesman, enforcer and bounty hunter, a Cutter is a dangerous person to have at your heels.

# **Stubjack Advances**

*"They took everything, even my mother's deathring. Attacked my Grav-Sedan bold as blood! One of the Stubjacks even had the gall to wink and call me 'Lady'! Percivas, I demand you have the entire block eradicated."*

Savvy and brutal, Stubjacks specialise in ambush, robbery and turf war. Some lead gangs, others operate alone, but in all cases Stubjacks use strength, cunning and intimidating weapons to get what they want.

# **Gang Lord Advances**

*"The Robber-Monk they calls him, sleek as silver, twice as quick. Could steal your shadow while you're blinking, so they say. The Spire nobs are quaking in their boots. You mark my muzzle, there's more than one family safe that'll be cracked tonight!"*

The Gang Lord is skilled in high-stakes operations, from assassination to cat burglary and data-heists. He can put together a crew, or simply awe the local underworld with his low cunning and high returns.

# **Fixer Advances**

*"I know a fella… he could… sort you out. Course, he's mighty pricy, but you ain't in no place to bargain right now, are you?"*

The Fixer knows the art of finding things, and people, no matter how illegal, hidden or dangerous. A skilled fence, and deadly shot, the Fixer prowls the hiveways and city streets with the easy grace of a predator.

#### **Shark Advances**

*"Father, I write to beg you reconsider. If I were to invest the full sum of my inheritance, Mr Curzon could guarantee a full one hundred per cent return in the first year alone! These are not the claims of a fraud—I have inspected the mine with my own eyes!"*

Be it cards, cons or codes, Sharks prey on the foolish, proud and gullible. Masters of lies and misdirection, they fleece their targets with a smile.

#### **Charlata n Advances**

*"He seemed like such a nice young man…"*

The Charlatan is a master thief, who can bind even planetary governors to their web of elaborate deceit. Using sophisticated and long-term plans, they are architects of cunning subterfuges that put even the sharpest of lawmen on the back foot.
