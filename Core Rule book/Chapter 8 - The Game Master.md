*"Every soul wavers between the Void and the Emperor's Holy Light. Most falter."*

— Inquisitor Kaede, Ordo Hereticus.

The Imperium of Man is vast beyond all mortal reckoning. A legion of Administratum scribes working their entire lives to produce a single accurate accounting of the God-Emperor's realm would be doomed to failure before they had even started as the numbers exist only in a continuous flux. Worlds are constantly being found, lost, rediscovered and destroyed throughout the Imperium. Across this grand sweep of planets every conceivable culture, political system and ideal is somewhere represented. There are wonders and atrocities, saviours and lunatics, sinners and tyrants. There is courage that can break the heart and knowledge that can harrow the soul. All these worlds, as well as those teeming masses dwelling on and between them, are yours to define should you take up the mantle of Game Master. But remember, power corrupts they say, but it is those without it that most often speak thus…

# **THE GM'S LOT**

The Game Master has the vital task of bringing the grim darkness of the far future to life for the rest of the group, mainly by subjecting the Player Characters to the many horrible confrontations they will doubtless have as they make themselves useful to the Inquisition. It is the GM who runs the game, sets the stage that is the Imperium and ensures that everyone is enjoying themselves. It isn't always easy, but it can be a lot of fun and very rewarding. If you're the GM for your group, this chapter is designed to help you with your job, explaining what this game is about and assisting you in coming up with memorable experiences (the terminology for such incidents is usually "adventures" or "scenarios") for your Acolyte band. If you're a player, you may wish to lightly peruse this chapter just to catch a glimpse of some of the horrors that may be in store for your Acolyte.

Your job as GM is a bit like being the director of a play without a finalised script. You've assembled your cast (the players), know where the action is located (somewhere in the Dark Heresy universe), set the proper mood (a dark and merciless future) and have an idea of how the story goes (an adventure)—now you have to bring all these elements together to craft an exciting production. If you do your job well, everyone participating will have fun, perhaps in spite of growing to love and hate you for all the terrifying events you keep subjecting their PCs to!

Before you run your first game, you should prepare yourself:

**Read this rule book—**Don't just skim it—read it. You need to know the rules better than anyone else in the group. You don't need to memorise them, but you should certainly know where to look should a question come up. If you are familiar with *Warhammer Fantasy role play*, you'll find the rules familiar, but note that there are a few critical differences in approach.

**Have a plot in mind—**Before you can run a game, you need to have at least some idea of what will happen. That idea may be as vague as, "The Acolytes meet Ethern the Bone Numberer and then we'll see…" to a fully described, published adventure from Black Industries (one of which is included in the back of this book). Our website also has an ever-growing selection of free adventures to download and run. A pre-designed adventure has the advantage of being ready to play, whereas making up your own, while time-consuming, has its own rewards. Whichever course you choose, be as familiar as you can with the story you've chosen before beginning.

**Ready your supplies—**You will need a small collection of ten-sided dice—two for each player, including yourself—to run Dark Heresy. One character sheet per player, writing implements and some notepaper is also a good idea.

# **Running Dark Heresy**

Once everyone has generated an Acolyte, you can start the game. As Game Master, the following tasks are your main responsibilities:

**Framing the story**—The far future of the Imperium is enormously different from the world we know. It is to you that your players will look for their cues on how their PCs should act and react to the world around them, for you are the lens through which they view the dark future. Describe their surroundings in detail, lingering on what their senses tell them, the sights, the sounds and the smells. The better you are at depicting the right atmosphere, the more invested your players will become in their characters and the adventure.

**Act as the referee**—You are the final arbiter of game rules in all circumstances. When a player wishes to make a Skill Test, you tell them what dice to roll and what penalties or bonuses might be appropriate. You decide what is probable, possible, unlikely and flat-out insane. Keep in mind that it's easy to say "No" to the various stunts your PCs will try to pull off, but often a lot more fun to say "Yes, but there will be consequences…"

**Take on the role of the Non-Player Characters**— Everyone and everything who is not an Acolyte is played by you. Big job, that. This extensive variety of beings are known as Non-Player Characters (NPCs). In Dark Heresy, they range from simple serfs to a variety of alien races with inhuman mindsets. There are several sections later in this chapter to assist in characterising the many roles you will be playing. The important thing to remember is that the PCs are really whom the story is about, and the NPCs you introduce are supposed to serve that end.

# THE EMPEROR'S INQUISITION

The central premise of Dark Heresy is that the PCs are Acolytes of an Inquisitor—exceptional individuals from other paths, whose unique personal attributes have brought them to the attention of a member of the Inquisition. The Acolytes have been recruited to serve their Inquisitor to the best of their ability. Inquisitors are few and scattered, for the Imperium of Man is vast and the its enemies are legion. The powerful Inquisitors have neither the time nor the resources to personally follow up every accusation of heresy that may come to their attention. This is where the players come in.

They are operatives of the Inquisition, empowered to investigate allegations of heresy and other charges of deviant behaviour on behalf of their Inquisitor. While the power of Acolytes is definitely limited compared to that of a full Bearer of the Seal, when the time comes for them to brandish their Inquisitorial Rosettes, few will take them lightly. Most of the time though, Acolytes work in disguise or from the shadows, as word of their presence or actual identities could alert their enemies, especially if the local authorities are the ones they've been sent to investigate.

Acolytes join the Inquisition for as many reasons as there are Acolytes. Many believe the work of the Inquisition is holy and in serving its needs they serve the God-Emperor. Some seek redemption for past deeds, while others just want a clean data-slate. A fair number care only that the Inquisition pays well. Regardless of their reasons for joining their Inquisitor's retinue, the PCs must work

together as part of a group that includes the Inquisitor who recruited them along with other agents that may or may not be known to them. For more details, see **Chapter X: The Inquisition**.

# **KNOW THEM BY THEIR WORKS**

The type of Inquisitor each group of Acolytes works for will affect the majority of Dark Heresy adventures you run for them and will certainly end up colouring their perceptions of the Imperium. While players are often willing to be fairly flexible in what they'll put up with for a one-off game, you can rest assured that if you wish to run a series of linked adventures, usually known as a "campaign", they'll want a say in the nature of their patron Inquisitor. Actually, this can be a great asset to you as a GM and you should strongly consider discussing the merits of various potential Inquisitors with your players before the game begins. Several of the Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave are detailed from **[pages 316](#page-316-0)[–322](#page-322-0)**. They represent a wide range of beliefs and philosophies, affording you and your players a fair number of patron choices. If none of them interest you, you can create another Inquisitor to better suit your group's desires. The sort of Inquisitor they prefer can tell you a lot about what it is they might want from adventures and your campaign. Anyone wanting to work for the Ordo Malleus clearly wishes to struggle against Daemons, just as those seeking employment with an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos crave alien conspiracies. Those that would follow the Ordo Hereticus wish to seek out and eradicate the corruption that lies within.

# **Golden Rules**

There are five golden rules to remember when running a game. While one could, and indeed several people have, written books about the art of game mastering, if you keep these rules in mind you won't go far wrong.

**Always be fair. Remember, you are the referee.** The rules are here to help you make decisions, but many of them rely on your sense of fair play. Since you control the game in a very real sense, it's easy to let that go to your head. Do not give in to that temptation and do not start acting arbitrarily. role playing is a group experience and your players must trust that you'll do the right thing.

**Give them a chance.** Players come up with all kinds of crazy ideas. Often, your first instinct will be to say, 'No, you can't do that.' Resist that urge and stop to consider the action. Players are frequently quite inventive and you don't want to squash that. Rather than just saying 'no', give them a chance—even if it's a small one. They are the heroes of your story after all and they deserve it.

**Lay down the law.** That said, remember you are in charge. Some players delight in running roughshod over carefully prepared games. It is thus sometimes necessary to remind them who's the boss. Other players will try to endlessly argue with you about the rules. Do not let them get away with it. Simply say, "That's my ruling, it's time to move on."

**Don't play favourites.** This goes back to the point about fair play. All your players should get equal "screen time". If one character is dominating a scene, make sure to ask the others what they are doing and try to re-engage them in the game. Also, make sure that everyone gets a chance at interesting story opportunities and whatever special items you deem appropriate to hand out.

**Keep the pace brisk.** You are the narrator of this story, so it is your responsibility to keep it moving. It's easy to get bogged down looking up rules, or going off on a wild tangent. Try to rein that in and keep up the pace. The last thing you want to see when you look up from behind your GM screen is bored faces.

# **Playing the Inquisitor**

Whatever sort of Inquisitor you end up choosing, remember it is the Acolytes who are the true protagonists of your Dark Heresy adventures. Since the Inquisitor is likely to be an NPC played by you, don't make a habit of upstaging the PCs. Make certain the Inquisitor is often busy with other cases, ideally those that are whole subsectors away. In the Imperium, communication between worlds is very slow—astropathic transmissions can take a great deal of time and requests for immediate assistance are often in vain. Your Acolytes should never get the idea that if they call their master whenever they're in trouble he'll be able (or willing) to come rushing to their rescue. Your greatest resource in this could very well be your players—just ask them what their master is doing and why he can't help them. Their answers could even serve to set up future adventures!

# **MANY ARE CALLED, MOST ARE FOUND WANTING**

A lot of role playing games start characters off with few builtin presumptions and no particular expectation of action other than "adventuring"—translation: you are a group of random individuals of varying talents who have coincidentally met in a tavern and decided to set out in search of riches and excitement. Dark Heresy supposes that the PCs are all skilled individuals who were hired by their Inquisitor employer at some point in the "past" of your game's time-line for the specific purpose of assisting him in rooting out heresy within the Calixis Sector. In fact, one or more of the characters may have worked for the Inquisition in such a capacity for many years. Your initial adventure, however, is likely to be the first time the PCs have ever met or worked with one another as a group, as many Inquisitors are fond of gathering cells of diverse Acolytes together whose skills complement one another—a convenient practice from a GM's point of view. A single adventure can take anywhere from one game session to a dozen or more to conclude. Most Dark Heresy adventures are liable to continue until a given case of the Inquisition has been investigated and a variable number of heretics have been either identified for others to handle or dealt with directly by the PCs.

# THEMES IN DARK HERESY

W Whether you intend to plot out a single adventure or lay the framework for an entire campaign, there are certain ideas that resonate throughout Dark Heresy. By planning adventures that help to evoke and further these themes, you will help to immerse your players into the dark distant future of the Imperium.

# **ONE MINUTE TO MIDNIGHT**

The Imperium is tottering on the brink of ruin and disaster. Enemies surround mankind: terrible, rapacious and horrific enemies that seek to destroy humanity utterly. Across the Imperium, man is caught up in countless struggles to survive. Doom fills the air, and the end is nigh. In the Calixis Sector, the terrifying Tyrant Star waxes fat and powerful, ready to unleash hell, unless, that is, the Inquisition can somehow turn back the overwhelming tide of dread and ruin.

# **THERE IS TAINT IN ALL THINGS**

Corruption, in every manner it can be expressed, is everywhere. Entropy is the natural state of the universe. All things inevitably seek to break down into the primal chaos from which they came. The efforts of humanity to hold corruption at bay will ultimately prove to be futile, as every system that has ever been erected to hold off the decay are also subject to it.

Libraries built to maintain accurate knowledge of the past corrode; their codifiers break down introducing errors into the data records. Scrolls are burned, lost, miscopied or deliberately falsified by those who would control the future by altering the past. Institutions form, flourish for a time, then fall short of their promises, forgetting their original purpose. Eventually, many such organisations exist only because tradition dictates that they should do so, for nobody knows why they were created or the meaning of the work they do.

Most obvious to all is the corruption of the body, for mutation has become common on many Imperial worlds, and incidents regarding psykers grow more frequent with every passing century. Subtler still is the threat posed by the many people who slowly adapt physically to their environments, losing the "purity" of the human form and those who have forgone "meat" in favour of metal. Souls and minds fester as surely as flesh. Daemonic influence is ever present. Insanity is rife. Those that seek to do what is just lose their way, their pure motives corroding until they find themselves performing the most debased and vile of acts all in the name of decency.

## Calcified Knowledge and Mystical Technology Know Your Place**

In the Imperium, most of its citizens have no idea how the manifold examples of extant and ancient technology work or that they even exist. A soldier of the Imperial Guard can field strip his lasgun in under thirty seconds, yet he has no grasp of what purpose the various mechanisms he has pulled out of his weapon actually serve. Even the low level Tech-priests of the Mechanicus of Mars have no comprehension of what it is that they do—their knowledge is by rote. Machines work because their operators followed the appropriate rituals to appease the machine's "spirit" not because they pushed the runic button inscribed with the sacred word of power "ON".

The Imperium prizes a stasis of thought. Traditional ways are always the best ways and obedience to dogma without any consideration for what it may mean is common. Thus, both technology and knowledge have become sacred. All but the most basic of technological devices are thought of as supernatural and capable of being regarded as either holy or unholy. Superstition is commonplace, as the breakdown of knowledge has meant that the majority of the populace are unable to comprehend the reasons why something may be so; the citizens of the Imperium rely on charms and ceremonies to allay their fears as they have little capacity for self-examination or critical thinking. Frequent users of any form of technology know a variety of rituals that they must observe to keep the spirits of their machines placated. There are many who truly believe that ignorance is a form of strength. Active scientific research is rare and often regarded with fear. Outside of the followers of the Omnissiah, it is practically non-existent in the Imperium.

# **THERE IS ONLY WAR**

The Imperium has a vast number of worlds that haven't known even a hint of battle for over ten thousand years, but there is no Imperial world within the reach of the Astronomican that doesn't have what is known as a "siege mindset". Constantly harangued about the dangers of xenos threats and more nebulous enemies that lurk out in the dark, the people of the Imperium are forever being reminded that war could come to their world at any time. Every planet's tithes go towards fuelling the Imperial war machine, which is eternally engaged in hundreds, if not thousands, of conflicts across the galaxy. Some are unquestionably large-scale wars, such as the struggle against the chitinous alien horde of living weapons known as the Tyranids that are presently attacking large swathes of the Eastern Fringe, or the ten thousand years long fight against the traitorous ancient followers of the Ruinous Powers that lurk inside the Segmentum Obscurus within the region known as the Eye of Terror. Almost all industries within the Imperium aid the various war efforts in one way or another and the authorities of many planets are often at pains to point out to their citizens how important their efforts are in securing the Imperium's future.

# **KNOW YOUR PLACE**

The Imperium clings strongly to a feudal mentality. Nations brought up following the Imperial Creed have a very definite sense of obligation and a clear idea of what their "place" is within their society. Travel is rare and most citizens never leave the world of their birth. Conformity to what is expected is the norm. Indeed, one of the many reasons why mutants and psykers are so persecuted is because they generally exist outside of the accepted bounds of Imperial culture. The Imperium has three tithes, which it levies against the majority of its worlds:

- Control your psykers and give them over to the Black Ships.
- Whether troops or materials, supply the required amount when asked.
- Have no dealings with enemies of the Imperium.

In exchange for adhering to these three obligations, the Imperium safeguards its worlds against the many dark forces arrayed against them. The majority of Imperial citizens see nothing wrong with this system. Most will report any "witches" they know of (though superstition may silence them) and deviant behaviour when they see it. They willingly join the Imperial Guard when called upon to do so, and the thought of seeing an alien, much less speaking with one, is abhorrent. They proudly serve their leaders and exult in the Imperium's victories. They whisper in awe about the glorious campaigns of the Space Marines and tremble in fear at the thought of ever crossing the Inquisition…

That said, Inquisitors and those they tend to choose as Acolytes are notorious for not knowing their place or even for refusing to accept that they might have a place. It is one of the great ironies of the Inquisition that in order to protect Imperial society, its agents frequently remain outside of it.

# **WE'RE ON A MISSION FROM THE GOD-EMPEROR**

So your players all have their Acolytes ready to uncover heresy, seek out corruption and purge the xenos threat. Time to summon the Daemon into the details. Time to discuss some plot elements you'll need to help craft an adventure worthy of the name Dark Heresy.

# **HEROES, HERETICS AND EVERYONE IN-BETWEEN**

It is the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that you create and play that will do the most to bring the grim future of Dark Heresy alive for your players. A role playing game is populated with all manner of persons that don't matter too much in the overall structure of your adventures. Every irate clerk doesn't really need to be given game statistics. These faceless masses of NPCs serve mainly as setting aids. The few that your Acolytes may actually face in combat should usually have game statistics, but they can't take a whole lot of damage as they mainly serve as cannon fodder.

There are others though, who are special. These are more detailed NPCs and their interactions with the Acolytes should ultimately serve to drive the plots of many of your adventures. Major NPCs do not necessarily need to be as fully detailed as a PC, though they most often will be. Their purpose in your game is to bring depth to the setting by highlighting different aspects of it, and often, to create conflict. Conflict is what drives every good story, though the nature of the conflict varies. In many role playing games, conflict is often violent, but the desires and needs of NPCs can cause other sorts of clashes as well. Whenever you introduce a major NPC, you should consider exactly how he/she/it will interact with your band of Acolytes. The desires and needs of these NPCs will directly affect what they may want from your PCs. The following broad categories cover the majority of what most such major characters could want.

# **Help**

The NPC wishes or needs the assistance of one or more of the Acolytes. The characters' master could questionably fall into this category. No one approaches agents of the Inquisition lightly, so if your PCs have settled in one area long enough to be known to the locals, those approaching them are likely to have very serious problems. Travelling or incognito, PCs could still be asked for help for any number of reasons. Since PCs tend to be fairly competent individuals, one common reason they may be approached is because the NPC wishes to make use of the skills that they have.

# **Exploit**

The NPC intends to use the PCs to his advantage, regardless of their personal desires on the subject. Such an NPC may frame the band (or expose their actual practices to the right people) in order to advance his own position or further his plans. Some Inquisitors push their Acolytes until they break, then casually discard them when they are no longer of use. Note, however, that not all NPCs that set out to utilise the PCs necessarily intend them harm. The nobleman who wishes to see his corrupt brother removed so that he has a clearer line to power may offer his assistance freely to the characters—he is still exploiting them for his own ends, but he is also helping them do their job.

# **Resist**

The NPC opposes the PCs in some way—a state that can range from "friendly rivalry" to "willing to destroy an entire planet, if it will kill one or more of the Acolytes". Generally, any dangerous heretics the PCs ever fight will fall under this category, with the really clever ones perhaps attempting to exploit them as well.

# **Teach**

Often the rarest of NPCs, but still among the most important, instructors and mentors both have this motivation. Such NPCs wish to increase one or more of the Acolytes' skills or understanding. Some truly have an altruistic desire to teach, whereas others will have selfish reasons for imparting their wisdom, in which case they may well intend to use their position of trust with the PCs to manipulate them. One or more of your players' Acolytes could be a student of their employer, especially if the PC is intending to become an Inquisitor himself one day.

Finally, consider how the NPC intends to get what he wants from the Acolytes. What sort of person is he? Will he ask politely, or ruthlessly blackmail the PCs into doing his bidding? Will he seek to have them all killed from a distance or will his honour insist that he look them each one directly in the eyes before he gives orders for them to be cut down. What resources are at his disposal to accomplish his aims? How far is he willing to go if the PCs defy him? Thinking about the answers to these questions before the Acolytes even meet your NPC will help you role play them effectively, especially since no PC will ever do exactly what you expect them to.

There are many ways to run foul of the Emperor's Inquisition. A fair number of Imperial transgressions are not the choice of the offender in question, for example, nobody asks to be born a mutant. Those that wilfully break the Emperor's laws, though, tend to be fairly dangerous types as the penalties are invariably harsh. When creating "bad guys" for your Acolytes to take on, remember that few "villains" ever see themselves as such. Regardless of whatever crimes they have committed, they justify their behaviour, to themselves at least, as appropriate considering their circumstances. In some cases, the PCs may even agree with them, which doesn't make the heretics in question any less guilty.

Variety, as the old saying has it, is the spice of life—it is certainly the key to creating engaging foes for your Acolytes. If every heretic is a Chaos cultist that represents a galaxy-striding evil, your adventures can swiftly become somewhat repetitious. Choose foes with a variety of different means and abilities. It's always worthwhile to come up with one or two really nasty villains—perhaps they/him/it reappear a couple of times in a campaign and become a nemesis to the Acolytes. When your players discover that their Acolytes are trying to stop something truly monstrous, their engagement in the game will be heightened and their fun increased.

# **A PROPER STAGE**

The sheer number of settings available in the Imperium may be somewhat overwhelming. While deciding where you want to set an adventure, think about its scope. Are the Acolytes meant to track down a single fugitive or do you intend them to uncover the tendrils of a massive cult that worships strange alien masters? By thinking in advance about what your PCs will be doing, you can help pick a proper stage (or stages) for them to do it on. Many campaigns can begin and end on a single planet—some of them may never even leave the bowels of a specific hive—but others may well roam from world to world.

The types of adventures you're running are surely influenced by where you set them as well. A "murder mystery" set on a desolate colony world will feel very different to one that plays out in a noble's court. The setting itself can be the primary element in some adventures, especially if you highlight one or more of the parts of the setting unique to Dark Heresy. Take, for example, a ship travelling through the warp, one protected only by the geller fields that hold warp predators at bay. Anyone travelling on such a ship is effectively trapped until it makes its next stop in realspace. But let's persist in this—what is one of the worst things that can happen when you're trapped? Being hunted. So what could hunt the Acolytes? A xenoform? An assassin? Eversor assassins tend to be somewhat… unstable. What if the PCs were hitching a ride with an Inquisitorial ship when an Eversor got loose in the hold, an Eversor whose last orders were to kill everything he came into contact with, until given the right code words to make him stand down? What if the same accident that set him loose killed the only man on board that knew the code words? One night's setting and adventure (staying alive!) all in one.

Just as there are appropriate settings for various adventures, there are a lot of exciting places to have a fight. Whenever there is a likelihood that combat will occur in your game, see if you can arrange for it to be somewhere interesting. Very few fights in Dark Heresy happen out in open fields with no cover. Thinking about the "terrain" in advance will give you some idea of what could happen during the fight, as well as making the fight exciting for your PCs. Combat is deadly in Dark Heresy and battles should always be swift and uncertain—a course one only engages in if there is no other option.

# **HERESIES GREAT AND SMALL**

The following are examples of the types of adventures that members of the Inquisition face on a regular basis. A few of these situations only challenge the inexperienced, for if you're still alive after having investigated the shadows of the Imperium for a century or two, you'll have doubtless learned more than you care to about heresy. Others will test the mettle of even the most stalwart of Inquisitors.

The greatest troubles often begin with only the smallest of warnings; like an iceberg, the modest peak that shows above the surface gives no indication of the scope of that which lies beneath. Many investigations crucial to the Imperium's history have begun simply, heralded by an ominous phrase such as, "Ezekial has been acting strange lately". Experienced agents of the Inquisition soon develop a keen eye for noticing unusual patterns of behaviour and what they might indicate, such as cult activity, Daemonic possession, psychic emergence, xenos influence and so on—the list is long. They also have to be wary that they don't start reading ominous doom in every stray glance and odd bit of conduct that they happen to notice, as there are a fair number of non-heretical explanations for a wide range of unusual activities.

Many Acolytes end up spending a fair amount of time secretly studying suspicious individuals from a distance in order to discern if anything heretical is actually occurring. If they do discover that their subject has succumbed to heresy, their response varies depending on what the heretic is up to. Frequently, however, criminal dealings of one sort or another are the reason for wary conduct. Inquisitors generally expect their Acolytes to report such activity to the local authorities to handle when they find it, as they have better uses for their agents than allowing them to act as impromptu police. Sometimes what appears to be "normal' criminal behaviour is in fact the first clue to a deeper and darker conspiracy, where random threads and clues start to build an elaborate picture of a grand criminal or Daemonic plan. Some Inquisitors, especially those with more flexible morals, are deft at using underworld elements to their advantage—their Acolytes may, in fact, find themselves acting as liaisons between their master and the criminals they've discovered. Such Inquisitors are frequently willing to extend a certain amount of "protection" to the right sort of thugs, in exchange for information, black market goods, extra muscle when needed, etc.

# **We're All Cultists Here**

The only religion "officially" recognised by the Imperium is the Cult of the God-Emperor, which ostensibly follows the Imperial Creed as taught by the preachers of the Adeptus Ministorum. All other cults are heretical, including the Cult Mechanicus, though only the most unthinkingly zealous of priests attempt to preach against the beliefs of the Machine God's followers. While this seems straightforward on the surface, the Imperial Creed has in fact been interpreted countless different ways over the various worlds on which it flourishes. What's more, the Ecclesiarchy was only established as the official religion of

the Imperium close to 3,000 years after the Emperor was encased in the Golden Throne as it had, prior to its ascension, been the largest and most influential of the many cults dedicated to the God-Emperor, all of which had sprung up after His "deification". Consequently, there are many, many different sects within the Imperium, the majority of which can legitimately claim authenticity —although if each was to explain their beliefs in detail to one another a holy war of epic proportions would likely occur, as all sides would regard the others as heretics on account of their deviations from the "one true faith". The Adeptus Ministorum exists to prevent such occurrences, but they still arise from time to time. Generally, the Ecclesiarchy is loath to bring the Inquisition into such matters, though if they must summon an Inquisitor, they will invariably request a member of the Ordo Hereticus.

Whichever particular strain of the Imperial Creed that the Ecclesiarchy favours in any given century is not what concerns the Inquisition, but the ease with which true deviancy can slip by unnoticed into the many variations of the God-Emperor's Cult. Since few Imperial citizens are raised to question authority and the majority are encouraged to believe in what they are told by the members of the Ecclesiarchy, a subtly corrupt priest can do massive damage before being discovered. The populace of entire worlds have been lost to suicide cults and much worse because of warp-tainted demagogues. The medieval mindset of Imperial citizens encourages them to deeply believe in spiritual powers beyond their comprehension, which the Ecclesiarchy tells them should be the God-Emperor. The followers of the Ruinous Powers have learned to take advantage of the Imperial "need to believe" by combining it with the subtle lure of secret lore or privileges. By posing as one of the countless sects of the God-Emperor, one offering certain advantages or boasting a lofty or elitist status, a Chaos cult can ensnare many influential followers. By the time such people are initiated into the "deeper mysteries" that their new sect offers, it is far too late for them to escape its clutches. Those who embrace the worship of the foul Chaos gods turn their back on the Emperor and His works, involving themselves in acts of heinous depravity and utter madness as they walk the razor-lined path to power that the Ruinous Powers offer.

It is one of the primary duties of the Inquisition to root out and destroy cults dedicated to the dark gods of Chaos before they can do any lasting harm. One of the most dangerous tasks that a band of Acolytes can take on is the infiltration and possible elimination of a Chaos cult. Not only is there a very real danger if one is discovered, there is also a terrible chance of warp corruption of the soul from learning too much of a heretical cult's beliefs. These secretive cults are incredibly dangerous opponents, as it can be very difficult to tell how far their influence has spread. It is difficult to rely on local backup if you think they may suddenly turn on you! Worse still, the corruption inherent in such depraved beliefs can often manifest itself in disturbingly tangible ways—the leaders of such cults often have strange powers and are frequently mutants, powerful psykers, Daemon-touched or a combination thereof. While the majority of Acolyte bands will only be involved in the discovery and elimination of such groups, there are some Radical Inquisitors who allow and even encourage heretical cults in the belief that they can use them to further their aims —fighting fire with fire, so to speak. Acolytes working for such an Inquisitor may find their faith sorely tested if they are asked to cooperate in certain rituals…

# **The Creatures Outside**

The Adeptus Ministorum preaches that the Emperor's greatest glory lies in His protection of humanity from the horrors of the immaterium. The Astronomican, which guides the ships of the Imperium through the darkness of the warp, is the most tangible example of his benevolence. The Ecclesiarchy makes a point of not discussing what those unseen terrors might be, though. Within the Imperium, the Navis Nobilite and the Inquisition have the greatest knowledge of what resides in the darkness of the empyrean. The warp is thought to be a dark reflection of the material universe, a place of raw emotion given form. Psykers claim that every soul (save those of Untouchables) flickers as a light in the immaterium. The light of a psyker burns the brightest and, without the proper mental discipline or training, can serve to summon forth the beings that call the warp home when they invoke their powers. While there are a variety of strange life forms that exist in the warp, the type that tends to concern the Inquisition the most are known as warp entities.

Warp entities are creatures that the Ordo Malleus believes to be formed of the raw energy of the immaterium itself. The majority of such creatures seem to be hostile to terrestrial life, but the most dangerous by far are the Daemons of Chaos. Daemons are typically formed from the most extreme thoughts and emotions congealed into a single sentience. The Daemonhunters have spent millennia trying to catalogue all the different forms the Daemon can take, but the task is never complete, as the Daemon hordes seem to be endless. All Daemons hate, yet desire, the world of flesh with terrible endless malice. They hunger for a solid form and the sensations that a body can provide, even as they despise the weaknesses of living beings. Unprotected psykers represent the surest way that Daemons can force their way into realspace, using the unfortunate psyker as an energy conduit to allow them access. Daemons take on a myriad of different appearances in realspace, but all are composed of energy made flesh and even the most "lesser" Daemon is incredibly deadly. Fortunately, as creatures of the immaterium, they require a continuous flow of emotional or psychic power to sustain them or they soon lose physical form and collapse back into energy, returning to the warp whence they came. Unfortunately, areas where Daemons have succeeded in attaining flesh become corrupt as the dimensions stretch thin, making the process of crossing into realspace progressively easier. Eventually the barrier between dimensions can collapse entirely, permanently juxtaposing an area of the immaterium with an equal area of realspace, resulting in a hellish Chaos realm where spirit and flesh become equally malleable. Daemons that wish to stay in realspace for an extended time will try to possess a psyker by seizing control of his body. If the Daemon is successful, the resulting creature is known as a Daemonhost and while often not as powerful as a manifested Daemon, they are still some of the most dangerous beings in the galaxy. Daemons frequently cooperate with the followers of the Chaos gods to benefit from the blasphemous rituals that cultists perform to bring them across from the empyrean and into reality, in order to further the cultists' own power.

Acolytes of the Inquisition, especially those seconded to the Ordo Malleus, are trained to look for signs of Daemonic possession. Such foes cannot go long unopposed, for their power can grow greatly very, very quickly—and Acolytes that discover the undue influence of the warp often have to act swiftly to stop it before it can spread beyond control. The role of the Daemonhunter is a lonely one, for few have the strength of will or the spirit to long endure the terrible knowledge of the Daemonic. Acolytes who take up this most sacred of roles freque-ntly start out pious but often become greatly troubled by what they encounter. Numerous agents eventually succumb to corruption of some sort, if they manage to survive for long. The few that endure with their sanity intact frequently request that they be allowed to either concentrate on other foes or retire entirely from active fieldwork in the service of the Inquisition. Despite the many obvious and manifest dangers of the Daemonic, there are those Inquisitors who believe that the power of Chaos can be used against itself. The most audacious, be they knowledgeable or simply foolish, dare to bind a Daemon into a specially prepared body marked with blessed runes of binding and snared with eldritch sigil-carved chains to form a creature known as a Daemonhost. Daemonhosts are bound to serve their creator and theoretically obey his commands without question, though this is a dubious prospect at best. Any Inquisitor that is ever proved to have created a Daemonhost is automatically declared Excommunicate Traitoris and hunted down by his fellows, invariably led by a squad of Grey Knights—the legendary Chapter of Adeptus Astartes that serves as the Ordo Malleus's chamber militant. So why do Radical Inquisitors even risk such a reprimand? Because Daemonhosts are grotesquely powerful and a potent asset when combating other Daemons and rogue psykers. Acolytes that become aware of an Inquisitor who employs Daemonhosts are honour-bound to report the matter to the Ordo Malleus. Those that don't are automatically condemned along with him if his heresy is ever discovered and their silence is proven.

# **The Problem With Psykers**

Psykers are feared and hated, widely denounced as heretics. The mightiest of their number can unerringly command entire populations, fling their thoughts to the farthest reaches of the galaxy and crush a Battle Titan with their will. They are dangerous potential conduits for Daemons from the immaterium.

One of the responsibilities that Acolytes may take on is the search for newly emerging psykers. Such a task can be a heavy emotional burden, as psykers come from every walk of life and almost none of them asked to be one. Many of them fear and hate what they've become. They are often filled with rage and self-loathing, which, when combined with their newly acquired powers, can make them dangerous and unpredictable opponents. Psykers who have embraced their abilities are even worse. Their control over their psychic talent is seldom precise, but they are often still devastatingly lethal to everyone around them. Psykers who manage to avoid early Imperial detection are forced to hide their powers by going where the standard authorities would be loath to follow them; many Imperial worlds have lawless areas where even the toughest arbitrators will not go and it is there that wyrds can be found, selling their powers to the highest bidder. Wyrds are mercenary psykers, self-taught individuals of wildly varied abilities who eke out a living as far from Imperial scrutiny as they can. The Inquisition is not the only group on the lookout for psykers, though. A number of fledging psykers are inducted into cults or other groups willing to hide them from the Black Ships' tithe. Psykers in league with the forces of Chaos are one of the greatest dangers the Imperium faces. Acolytes fighting rogue psykers who are allied with the Ruinous Powers face an enemy that may very well know what they intend to do before they can even enact it. Such opponents are willing to pull forth the secrets of the Acolytes' past in order to mentally violate them, making the fight against experienced psykers as emotionally damaging as fighting against Daemons. The

Inquisition is thus one of the foremost bodies of the Imperium for making use of Untouchables to serve the cause of the Ordo Hereticus in the capture and/or execution of rogue psykers.

# **Xenos Among Us**

The Ecclesiarchy preaches that it is the manifest destiny of the God-Emperor's Imperium to rule the entire galaxy and even those of more secular leanings believe this to be so. All other races are regarded as trespassing in humanity's space. The majority of humans that willingly deal with sentient xenos in any other than a violent fashion are considered to be heretics. Still, the scattered nature of the Imperium's many systems means there are a vast number of planets that bear xenoforms interlaced with those of humanity. While there are a few alien species that simply wish to be left alone, the greater majority ever encountered by the Imperium are all actively hostile to humankind. The Ordo Xenos is continually on the watch for the many threats posed by alien life forms, from deadly diseases to invasion forces. They must constantly guard against the sinister threats posed by alien-worshiping cults, Eldar raiders, the Great Devourer and the brutal Orks to name but a few.

A more insidious threat is present in the form of xenos technology. The more orthodox members of the Adeptus Mechanicus preach that all technology that doesn't derive from humankind is corrupt and capable of endangering its user's soul (at least, that's how they often justify their "requisitions"). Alien works are therefore often deemed suspect. Imperial propaganda generally depicts all items of non-human manufacture as inferior to those of humanity. If forced to acknowledge the efficacy of another race's technology, they swiftly forward the Mechanicus's arguments that xenos devices are all potentially damning. None of this changes the fact that a number of xenos artefacts are very powerful or can produce effects unknown to humanity's devices. Where there are illegal goods, there is profit to be had and a number of criminal groups throughout the Imperium deal in various xenos commodities, ranging from technology to drugs to slavery.

The Acolytes of the Ordo Xenos are forever on the watch for any signs of xenos influence. Cults dedicated to various xenos gods or venerating strange aliens themselves fall under their charter as do the many suspect criminal cartels and users of proscribed xenos technology. The agents of the Inquisition ceaselessly search for patterns when xenos become involved in any enterprise, because history has repeatedly shown that small intrusions often pave the way for full-scale invasions.

# **Rebellious Intent**

If they are able to do so, most of the Imperium's citizens seem to be content to go about their lives in relative peace. Many of the societies of the Imperium's worlds are oppressive though, which breeds resentment. Even the worlds that embrace a more egalitarian viewpoint frequently encourage conformity. Neither resentment nor forced compliance makes for contented people though. The Administratum, which runs the Imperium, is not unaware of this phenomenon. While planetary governors are allowed to run their worlds as they see fit, they are always encouraged to use the twin outlets of "faith" and "fear" as channels to redirect aggression. The Ecclesiarchy assists with the former, and constant vague rhetoric about the many threats of the galaxy helps with the latter. As long as

the Imperial tithes flow when needed, the Administratum often turns a blind eye to all but the most brutal of excesses. It is when the tithes end that the troubles start, for the Imperium does not suffer rebellion lightly. The greatest censure of an errant governor generally arrives in the form of an Imperial assassin, though larger rebellions frequently merit larger forces to put them down. Mutinous planets have been decimated as examples to others—yet rebellions, no matter how hopeless, will still occur, as defiance seems to be one of the defining traits of humanity.

Acolytes can find themselves involved in many different ways on either side of a rebellion. Some bands specialise in going undercover as they seek out particularly deadly threats lurking in the downtrodden shanties and seedy drinking halls. Some Radical Inquisitors may encourage rebellions (see **Chapter X: The Inquisition**) and Acolytes working for them may take up a career of rabble rousing. Neither supporting a rebellion, nor attempting to put one down, makes for a sedate life.

# **Burning Words**

There are many doors that should never be opened, some secrets that should be allowed to remain secrets. Nevertheless, there are various groups in the Imperium that seem determined to seek knowledge that has either been suppressed or deemed blasphemous. There are certain factions of scholars, often ones funded by the noble houses, which specialise in disciplines such as xenoarchaeology and psychic phenomena. As long as their findings are "approved", the Ecclesiarchy allows them to function with little interference, but a questing mind is seldom content with dogma and predisposed to stray into heretical thought. The followers of the Machine God are notorious for seeking out answers to forbidden questions, even when their superiors have forbidden them to continue down certain lines of inquiry. Finally, there are the more radical members of the Inquisition itself, who often consider themselves above the need to explain themselves or their reading choices. The Inquisition maintains a long list of heretical texts, many of which are to be burned unopened should they be discovered, that some individuals often treat as a "wish list".

Depending on the type of Inquisitor they're working for, Acolytes could find themselves involved in either the suppression of knowledge, its acquisition, or both. Stealing or destroying texts and data-files, pict doctoring, secretly corrupting the journals of soon-to-be-dead scholars so that their colleagues abandon certain roads of inquiry, record suppression, "fact" alteration, torching labs along with their occupants, searching for ancient texts—heretical or otherwise, are all distinct possibilities in the pursuit of guarding secrets. Remember that some knowledge is like a disease: once known it cannot be unknown no matter how badly an Acolyte wishes to forget what he has learned.

#### **We are our Own Worst Enemy**

The single most dangerous institution in the Imperium of Man is the Emperor's Inquisition. The greatest threat many Acolytes will ever face may very well come at the hands of a rival Inquisitor and his retinue. The Acolytes of the Inquisition are often the best at what they do: ruthless, dedicated and driven by the certain knowledge that what they do is right.

Trust is a luxury that Acolytes can seldom afford.

# **FOR GLORY OR GAIN?**

A Acolytes join the Inquisition for many reasons, but few ever manage to retire. Learning the dark secrets of the galaxy is not conducive to keeping one's sanity. Acolytes regularly face deadly foes, some of which are capable of rending not just bodies but souls as well. Why, then, do they walk into the darkness? Each answers for themselves alone. This section describes the rewards for PCs, as well as advice for how to hand them out.

# **EXPERIENCE POINTS**

Experience Points (xp) are the most common reward in Dark Heresy. Characters use them to buy Advances, Skills, Talents and Career Path changes, as this overall process represents the way they become more adept over time. As the GM you are responsible for awarding Experience Points. You want to give out enough to ensure that characters are progressing but not so much that they blow through their Career Path too quickly. There are several different approaches to handing out Experience Points; descriptions of these follow.

# **The Abstract Method**

This is the easiest way to hand out Experience Points and the one recommended for beginners. It has one simple guideline: give each player 200 xp for every four hours of play time. This represents the length of an average session, so this method ensures that after each game a player can take an Advance, or a new Skill or Talent.

While other methods are success-oriented, the abstract method is predicated on the notion that all experience is valuable. In fact, failure is often more instructive than success, so what matters is simple survival. If characters can endure everything the galaxy can throw at them, they deserve a reward.

The four-hour mark is a guideline and it is meant to be flexible. If your group spends a lot of time joking around, taking snack breaks and so on, you may decide that six hours is more appropriate. If your sessions average three hours, but are packed with adventure, that can deserve Experience Points too.

# **The Detailed Method**

As the name indicates, this is the most time-consuming method of handing out xp, but it also gives you the greatest control. When using the detailed method, you break the adventure down into its component parts and give out an xp award for the successful completion of each section. Essentially, each step of the plot has its own reward. Awards can be as little as 5 xp for a minor event and as large as 50 xp for a major one. When considering an appropriate reward for each scene, you can use **Table 8–1: Encounter Difficulty**. This breaks down each scene using the basic framework of the Test Difficulty table.

# **Example**

*In one session, the PCs followed a tip to find a seedy bar in the underhive. There they met an information broker who was willing to point them in the direction of a notorious smuggler, supposedly dealing in xenos weapons. First, however, the broker wanted the Acolytes to remove one of her competitors, and since he was a mutant, they agreed. She didn't bother to mention his well-armed gang. After dealing with the underhive scum, the characters finally acquired the location of the smuggler they'd been searching for. For this session, the GM awards 30 xp for finding and dealing with the information broker; 50 xp for the fight with the mutant and his gang; and 40 xp for determining where the smuggler was located. Next session they'll doubtless pay the heretical xenos-coddling scum a visit…*

| Table 8–1:  | Encounter Difficulty |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Difficulty  | XP Award             |
| Very Easy   | 20                   |
| Easy        | 30                   |
| Routine     | 40                   |
| Average     | 50                   |
| Challenging | 80                   |
| Hard        | 100                  |
| Very Hard   | 130                  |

As with Test Difficulty, you should try to be fair when determining encounter difficulty. Was the obstacle easily overcome or was the victory dearly bought? Were the PCs at a disadvantage (perhaps due to psychic ability or numbers)? How many Fate Points did they use to get through the fight? These are all questions to consider when assigning encounter difficulty.

You should also consider the importance of the encounter when awarding xp. Randomly killing innocents, or even the guilty, without purpose merits nothing; what matters is bringing heretics to face the Emperor's justice. The climactic encounter at the end of a long adventure, however, is worth extra xp, perhaps up to double the normal award.

# **role playing Awards**

In addition to story-based Experience Points awards, you may also want to hand out individual awards for good role playing after each session. role playing awards should generally be in the 20-50 xp range and they are by no means automatic. The idea is to reward players who do an exceptional job portraying their characters.

What "good role playing" is can be quite subjective. There is a temptation to reward the boisterous and entertaining player, but you should try to consider the personality of the character being portrayed. A brooding Adeptus Mechanicus enginseer is not going

to dominate social situations, but effective role playing of that personality is still worthy of an award. As the campaign goes on and the characters evolve, everyone in the group will gain a greater understanding of the personalities of the various PCs. This ought to make judging role playing easier.

# **Fate Points**

You may, on rare occasions, wish to award a Fate Point to an Acolyte who has accomplished something truly remarkable at the end of a major story arc, but you should be sparing when handing them out.

# **Rank & Privileges**

As Acolytes of the Inquisition, the PCs already have access to a great deal of worldly influence. Still, there are many groups that will not automatically kowtow to the Inquisition. Acquiring friends and allies within other groups such as the underworld or the Adeptus Mechanicus is always a useful "reward" for an Acolyte. Gaining fame and social status within Imperial society is a bit of a double-edged sword for an Acolyte—while useful, it makes their frequent task of going undercover somewhat difficult. Then again, such connections may make going undercover unnecessary.

Membership in exclusive groups and access to dearly held secrets are great rewards for Acolytes. The Inquisition has many forbidden books that only trusted agents ever get access to. Characters may also have greater resources allocated to them, allowing them to call in greater amounts of support without having to check with their Inquisitor first. A rookie Acolyte can muster almost no one but his immediate companions—having to fend for himself and earn the privileges long service and trust can bring. An Acolyte with a century of loyal service can ask for and expect to receive whole battalions of Imperial Guard if he deems a situation requires it.

# **Elite Advances**

Normally, characters cannot learn Skills and Talents that are not part of their Career Advances. This is intentional. If characters could pick and choose whatever Skills and Talents they wanted, the entire Career Path structure would break down.

That said, you may reward characters with special training that lets them buy Skills and Talents outside their Career Path, but this should be a rare occurrence. You also must make sure that characters justify these acquisitions through their actions. Characters must seek out teachers, spend time training and often pay exorbitant prices for the lessons. Even then, such Skills and Talents should cost at least 200 xp, if not more. You may relax some of these strictures under special circumstances, but don't make it too easy. Your players should never assume that they can acquire whatever Skill they want regardless of their career.

# **INTERACTION**

*"A suspicious mind is a healthy mind."* — Inscription within the Bastion Serpentis

M Much of Dark Heresy centres on dealing with the many and varied peoples that inhabit the worlds of the Imperium. From the lax guards that monitor the entrances into the underhive, to the quartermasters that portion out vital gear, to witnesses, contacts and spies, knowing how to deal with the peoples of the 41st Millennium can give you a decided advantage in rooting out and burning the heretics.

# Interaction Skills **INTERACTION SKILLS**

**Chapter III: Skills** presents a number of Interaction skills such as Charm, Command, Deceive and Intimidate. Each of these are basic Fellowship skills meaning any characters can employ them, albeit at a reduced rate if they don't have the Skill. To befriend another, a player would use Charm; to issue an order, he would use Command; to fool or dupe, he would use Deceive; and to frighten, he would use Intimidate. Together, these Skills offer the discreet tools for interacting with the people of the Imperium.

# Using Interaction Skills **USING INTERACTION SKILLS**

Usually, a player doesn't need to Test Skills to interact with other characters. He simply plays the role of his character. The interactions between the player, in the role of his character, and the GM, in the role of the NPC, determine the outcome of the conversation. As in any situation with dramatic consequences, though, a player should make an appropriate Test if there are consequences for failure, if he is trying to convince an NPC to do something that he or she would ordinarily not do: spilling information about a secret, accept a bribe and so on, or if success would advance the plot in a considerable way. Ultimately, when a player does or does not make a Test is up to the GM. He will have final say about the circumstances of the encounter.

# **Dispositions**

When Testing an Interaction skill, circumstances can dictate the Difficulty of the Test. Such situations include atmosphere, situation and an NPCs particular circumstances. However, the most important factor is the NPCs disposition toward the player character—how the character regards him and what feelings or lack of feelings the NPC displays. The NPCs disposition, which is always set by the GM, determines the base difficulty. Other factors can adjust the Difficulty up or down as the situation demands. **Table 8–2: Dispositions** provides sample dispositions based on the Test a player is attempting and the corresponding Difficulty.

On a successful Test, the target's disposition improves by one step, plus one step per degree of success. On a failed Test, the target's disposition remains unchanged and worsens by one step for each degree of failure.

Generally, a target must at least be Indifferent to do as requested, and then the target will only do what the player wants 50% of the time if left to his own devices. Each step above Indifferent indicates that the target is 10% more likely to do as requested. Under supervision, the base chance increases by 20%.

# **Example**

*Drake and his fellow Acolytes have conscripted a group of local PDF troopers to help them in their hunt for a dangerous xenos in the depths of an ancient hive. Coming unexpectedly upon the creature in the dank waste reclamation tunnels, Drake must try and get his cohort of suddenly reluctant PDF troopers to attack.*

*The GM decides that the PDF troopers are well trained but not happy about being seconded by the Acolytes. The GM classes their disposition as Resentment, so Drake will need to succeed on a Difficult (–10) Command Test. Drake needs to succeed on the Test to improve the troopers' disposition to Indifferent, but then the troopers might run away if the fight goes badly. Luckily, Drake has a 46 Fellowship. He rolls d100, getting a 25: a success! Since he passed the Test by 21, he also got two degrees of success, meaning he improves the troopers' disposition to Devoted, which the GM rules is more than sufficient to ensure that they will fight to the bitter end.*

# **Interaction and Groups**

When a player uses an Interaction skill against a group of individuals, he resolves the Test in the way already described, but the GM sets the disposition based on the overall attitudes of the group. The player makes the Test as normal, but if he succeeds, he can affect a number of individuals equal to his Fellowship Bonus. The total indicates the number of targets the player affects with his successful Test. Note that certain Talents can increase the number of targets a player can affect.

| Table 8–2: Dispositions |          |              |                         |              |             |
|-------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|

| Very Hard               | –30      | Disgusted    | Mutinous                | Disbelieving | Foolhardy   |

# **FEAR & DAMNATION**

The 41st Millennium is a dark and terrible place where mankind's billions inhabit a universe filled with unnumbered horrors and countless dangers. Murderous aliens stalk the cold stars, rebellion and treachery fester within the shadow of the Imperium's decaying might and nightmarish forces eternally claw at the very fabric of reality from beyond, seeking both to feast and to corrupt. The Acolytes must struggle against this backdrop of sinister menace, dark violence and entropy, and fear; horror, madness and the subtle taint of Chaos are fundamental aspects of the games you will play. T

The rules presented here reflect these many threats to the mind and soul, and how the player characters interact with them. They are separated into three distinct, interlinking sections: Fear covers a character's immediate reaction to frightening events and creatures, Insanity details with the long-term effects of mental trauma on a character, while Corruption deals with the insidious influence of the warp and forbidden knowledge. During combat encounters, the only rules that will be used from this chapter are those for Fear. the effects of Insanity and Corruption are dealt with in the aftermath of a battle rather than during it.

# **INSANITY AND CORRUPTION POINTS**

Insanity Points (IP) and Corruption Points (CP) are Characteristics that characters gain during play. Both of these scores begin at 0 when a player starts and increase over time as damage is done to a character's state of mind (IP) and the purity of his soul (CP). The higher these scores, the more twisted, damaged and debilitated a character becomes, and should either of these scores ever reach 100, a character is hopelessly driven mad or tainted and his career and life come to a sudden and abrupt end, exactly as if he had been killed.

# **FEAR**

Fear comes into effect when the Acolytes are confronted with scenes of atrocity or horror, or when they are called on to battle against terrifying aliens, insane perversions of science and nightmarish entities from the warp. When an Acolyte is confronted by such a frightening event or adversary, they must take a Fear Test; this is a Willpower Test, modified by how frightening the thing is. If the Acolyte passes this Test then he may continue to act as normal. If he fails however, he succumbs to Fear.

# **Degrees of Fear**

Some things are clearly more frightening than others; for an Acolyte, having a gun waved in his face by a ganger, although obviously dangerous, is not sufficient to call for a Fear Test. However, having a gun waved at him by the walking corpse of his dead brother, while luminous white spiders scurry in and out of his bloodless open wounds—that calls for a somewhat severe one. The **Table 8-3: Fear Test Difficulties,** offers some guidelines on the severity of Fear Tests.

| Table 8–3: Fear Test Difficulties |          |                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Severity of Fear                  | Test Mod | ExampleAdversaries                          |
| Fear (1) Disturbing               | (0)      | Nightwing, Revenant,Synofian Bore Worm      |
| Fear (2) Frightening              | (–10)    | Carnosaur,Dusk Stalker,Murder Gholam        |
| Fear (3) Horrifying               | (–20)    | Incarnate Daemon,Astral Spectre,Psychneuein |
| Fear (4) Terrifying               | (–30)    | The King in Ragsand Tatters                 |

# **Failing the Fear Test**

If in a combat situation a character fails a Fear Test, he must immediately roll on **Table 8-4: The Shock Table**, adding +10 to the result for each degree of failure. The effects listed are applied immediately to the character.

If in a non-combat situation the character fails the Fear Test, the character becomes unnerved and suffers a -10 penalty to any Skill or Test that requires concentration on his part. This penalty lasts while the character remains in the vicinity of the object of their Fear (simply leaving and coming back again doesn't stop this!).

In addition, if a non-combat Fear Test is failed by 30 or more, the character also gains +1d5 Insanity Points.

# **Shock and snapping out of it**

Characters may be able to shake off some of the effects of Fear after the initial shock has worn off. Where specified on **Table 8-4: The Shock Table** that a character may "snap out of it", a character can make a Willpower Test when it is his next Turn. If this succeeds then he regains his senses, shrugs off the effects and may act normally from then on. If he fails this Test, the effect continues and he may try again when it is his next Turn.

## Table 8-4: The Shock Table

**Roll a d100 and add 10 for every degree of failure.**

- 01–20 The character is badly startled. He may only take a single Half Action when in his next Turn, but afterwards he may act normally.
- 21–40 Fear grips the character and he begins to shake and tremble. He is at a –10 penalty on all Tests for the rest of the encounter unless he can recover his wits (see **Shock and Snapping out of it, [page 232](#page-232-0)**).
- 41–60 Reeling with shock, the character backs away from the thing that confronts them. The character cannot willingly approach the object of his fear, but may otherwise act normally, with a –10 penalty on all Tests until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1 Insanity Point.
- 61–80 The character is frozen by terror. The character may make no Actions until he snaps out of it. After snapping out of it, the character will make all Tests with a –10 penalty for the rest of the encounter. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 81–100 Panic grips the character. He must flee the source of his fear, if able, as fast as he can, and if prevented from doing so he may only take Half Actions and is at a –20 penalty to all Tests. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points. Once away from the danger he must successfully snap out of it to regain control.
- 101–120 Fainting dead away, the character keels over and remains unconscious for 1d5 Rounds. Once he regain consciousness he is still shaken and takes all Tests with a –10 penalty until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 121–130 Totally overcome, the character screams and vomits uncontrollably for 1d5 Rounds. During this time he is helpless, may do nothing and drop anything he is holding. Afterwards, until the end of the encounter, the character may only take a single Half Action each Turn until he can rest. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 131–140 The character laughs hysterically and randomly attacks anything near him in a manic frenzy, firing wildly or using whatever weapon he has to hand. This effect lasts until the character snaps out of it, or until he is knocked unconscious. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 141–160 The character crumples to the ground for 1d5+1 Rounds sobbing, babbling and tearing at his own flesh, and may do nothing. Even after he returns to his senses, he is a complete mess and at a –20 penalty on all Tests until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1d5+1 Insanity Points.
- 161–170 The character's mind snaps and he becomes catatonic for 1d5 hours and may not be roused. The character gains 1d10 Insanity Points.
- 171+ The character is so affected that he begins to see strange and terrible visions as his hold on reality shatters. The character suffers the effects of "acute hallucinations" (see **Disorders, [page 234](#page-234-0)**) for 2d10 Rounds. After the hallucinations fade, the character will make all Tests with a –20 penalty while the encounter lasts. The character gains 2d10 Insanity Points and takes 1d10 points of permanent Willpower damage.

# **Very Bad Things**

Fear Tests in non-combat situations are very much the GM's call as to when and where they occur and should not be considered to be automatic. They should instead be used to build dramatic tension to your games, as their over-use will diminish their effectiveness and novelty, as well as grind down your Acolytes. That having been said, here are a few appropriate examples of events that can cause Fear:

**Disturbing** (0) Viewing the scene of a gruesome murder, minor unknown supernatural or psychic phenomena—strange lights, spectral voices, weeping statues, etc.

**Frightening** (–10) Meeting someone you know to be dead, being buried alive, major supernatural or psychic phenomena the skies raining blood, a painting forming shrieking mouths, etc.

**Horrifying** (–20) Sudden, shocking and inexplicable death (the man next to you on the shuttle suddenly dies, vomiting maggots), hideous moments of revelation (finding yourself covered in blood, surrounded by bodies with a meat cleaver in your hand and no memory of how you got there), the dead rising across a whole planet, etc.

**Terrifying** (–30) Experiencing a full-scale Daemonic incursion, discovering your failure is responsible for the deaths of millions, staring unprotected into the warp.

# Going Insane

Characters in Dark Heresy are at the centre of terrible events: battling indescribable horrors, uncovering shocking truths and engaging in desperate struggles where perhaps the lives and souls of countless innocents hang in the balance. Such are the stresses and terror involved that the slow slide into insanity is a constant threat. No human mind, not even one hardened by the harsh rigours of life in the Imperium, is immune to the slow erosion of sanity by the horrors of the 41st Millennium, and Acolytes are no exception.

In Dark Heresy these dangers are represented by Insanity Points. Insanity Points represent the strain put on a character's mind by his experiences; the more Insanity Points a character has the more fragile his mind. The cumulative effects of gaining Insanity Points are divided into Traumas, which represent the short term after-effects of particularly terrible experiences, and Disorders, which are permanent mental afflictions that sign post a character's slide into total madness.

# **DEGREES OF MADNESS**

A character is classified as having a certain degree of madness depending on how many Insanity Points they have. This classification gives a player a broad idea of the state of a character's mind and how close to the edge he has become. A character's degree of madness also determines the modifier that will apply to Tests taken to avoid Mental Trauma.

# **MENTAL TRAUMA**

Mental Trauma represents the relatively short-term damage to a character's state of mind that he suffers after experiencing a horrific or supernatural event. Each time the character gains 10 Insanity Points he must make a Trauma Test. This is a Willpower Test, modified in difficulty by how many Insanity Points the character has accrued in total (see **Table 8–5: The Insanity Track**). If the Test is passed the character manages to cope with his experience without extra ill effect. If the Test is failed roll d100, adding 10 for every degree of failure, comparing the result to **Table 8–6: Mental Traumas**. The result is applied to the character in the aftermath of any encounter that inflicted the Insanity Points on him.

# Gaining Mental Disorders 

Mental disorders reflect the permanent, long-term effects on a character's mind of exposure to things horrific and unnatural. A new disorder (or a more severe version of an existing disorder) is automatically gained each time the character has enough Insanity Points to increase his degree of madness by one stage as shown on **Table 8–5: The Insanity Track**. When a character acquires a disorder, the severity of that disorder will depend on his new degree of madness, as shown.

A character must have the preceding severity of a disorder for it to get worse, (so for a disorder to have become "Severe" the character must have the "Minor" version of the disorder first, with the exception of "The Flesh is Weak" that has no Minor version).

# **Example**

*Beam Rollings becomes unhinged after witnessing the horrifying Beast of Solomon. He already has a Minor Delusion of Invulnerability and so the GM decides to increase the level of the delusion to Severe rather than give him a new disorder.*

This lasts for 3d10 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 41–70                                               | The character must compulsively perform an action such as fevered praying, frantically cleaning a weapon, reciting verse, and so on, and pays little attention to anything else. All Tests that are based on Intelligence, Fellowship or Perception suffer a –10 penalty. This effect lasts for 3d10 hours.                                                  |

The character gains a +10 bonus to all Perception-based Tests and is at –10 penalty to his Willpower for the next 1d5 days.                                                                                                                                               |
| 101–120                                             | The character suffers from a temporary severe phobia (see Disorders, page 235). This effect lasts for 1d5 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 121–130                                             | The character reacts to the slightest stress or pressure by becoming extremely agitated. When performing any task that involves a Test, the character must first pass a Willpower Test or suffer a –10 modifier to the Test. If the character gets into combat, all Tests during combat automatically suffer a –10 modifier. This effect lasts for 1d5 days. |
| 131–140                                             | The character suffers vivid and extreme nightmares whenever they try to sleep. The next day and for the next 1d10 days the character will be exhausted by lack of sleep and gains a level of fatigue. This effect lasts for 1d5 days.                                                                                                                        |
| 141–150                                             | The character is struck dumb and is unable to speak. This lasts for 1d5 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 151–160                                             | Extremely distressed and unfocused, the character refuses to eat or drink and looks in a terrible state.

This effect lasts for 1d10 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

# **THE SEVERITY OF DISORDERS**

All disorders are rated as being Minor, Severe or Acute in ascending order of effect.

**Minor Disorder:** The effects of the disorder manifest rarely or are experienced only to a small degree. Any Test to overcome the effects of the disorder gain a +10 bonus. **Severe Disorder:** The effects of the disorder are stronger and may occur regularly. There is no modifier to Tests made to overcome the effects of the disorder.

**Acute Disorder:** The effects of the disorder are very strong and occur at the slightest stimulation. Any Test to overcome the effects of the disorder take a –10 penalty.

# **TYPES OF MENTAL DISORDER**

There is potentially no end to the variety of unpleasant and unwholesome disorders that might afflict a character, and a few examples are presented here. GMs should also feel free to invent their own to suit the individual Player Character and the horrors they undergo.

# **The Flesh is Weak!**

### **Seriousness:** Severe, Acute.

The character sees his flesh as weak and will constantly blame it for his failures and problems. He will also try to change and/or remove his flesh, becoming increasingly obsessed with surgical modification as well as bionic replacement.

# **Phobia**

**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character has a deep dislike and fear for a particular thing or circumstance. A phobic character must succeed on a Willpower Test to interact with the focus of his phobia. Enforced or gratuitous exposure to the focus of his exposure may incur Fear Tests. Examples of this disorder are:

# **Fear of the Dead**

The character has an abiding fear and loathing of corpses and the dead, possibly due to the fact that sometimes they don't stay dead…

## **Fear of Insects**

Scuttling things with many legs are the character's waking nightmare: faceless, numberless and hungry, forever hungry.

# **Obsession/Compulsion**

#### **Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character has a compulsion to perform a particular action or is obsessed with a particular thing. A character must make a Willpower Test not to act in a compulsive way or not pursue his obsession when the opportunity arises. Examples of this disorder include any of the following:

# **Kleptomania**

The character compulsively steals small objects if he has the opportunity. Often the character attaches no value to such objects.

# **Self-Mortification**

The character must scourge and whip his flesh on a regular basis (or after a particular event such as killing), in order to purge away the sin of his actions through pain.

# **Visions and Voices**

**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character sees things that are not there and hears things that others do not. Acute sufferers may experience visions into which they are totally immersed.

## **Dead Comrade**

The character hears the voice of an old friend now long-dead. At a Severe level, he may even have visions of his friend or converse with them, if his condition becomes Acute.

# **Flashbacks**

The character relives traumatic moments from his life. The length and vividness of these episodes vary according to the seriousness of his condition.

# **Delusion**

### **Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character suffers from a particular false belief that he has to act on as if it were the truth, despite his better judgement or evidence to the contrary.

# **Invulnerability**

The character believes that he will never get severely injured, either through luck or divine providence. Such a character would have to pass a Willpower Test not to enter a ganghouse and throw insults and punches instead of exercising due caution, for example.

# **Righteousness**

The character believes his choices are right and justified, no matter what the cost. Such a character might claim to be a Puritan despite using proscribed knowledge, or refuse to act subtly where it would otherwise be prudent to do so.

# **Horrific Nightmares**

# **Seriousness:** Minor, Severe.

The character suffers from vivid and reoccurring nightmares; trying to run from a black sun in the sky, or being imprisoned in an endless machine, for example. After any stressful day, the character must pass a Willpower Test in order not to succumb to his terrors while asleep. If he fails, the character will suffer from a single level of Fatigue (see **Fatigue, [page 200](#page-200-0)**) on the following day.

# **Only the Insane Shall Prosper…**

The more insane a character becomes the less horrific things seem. After all, what are the monsters of reality compared to those one sees whenever one closes one's eyes? If the first digit of a character's Insanity total is double or more a thing's Fear Rating (see **[page 325](#page-325-0)**) the character is unaffected by it and does not need to make a Fear Test.

# Removing Insanity Points From Your Character 

With the GMs permission, a character may use xp to remove Insanity Points. It costs 100 xp to remove a single Insanity Point. A character may never go down a degree of madness and so will never lose their disorders. All buying back of Insanity Points should be properly represented as time and effort spent by the character in game. Possible ways of representing the removal of Insanity are:

- Prayer, fasting, penance and mortification of the flesh.
- Long-term palliative care.
- Recuperation in quiet and pleasant surroundings.
- Contemplation of the great holy works or other articles of faith (the Credo Omnissiah for example for Mechanicus characters).

# **Example**

*Quinn Valentine has 21 Insanity Points and so will be unaffected by anything with a Fear Rating of 1.*

# CORRUPTION

The most insidious threat facing Acolytes in Dark Heresy, and indeed the Imperium as a whole, is the corrupting taint of Chaos. Encounters with Daemons, dark rituals and even the knowledge that such things are possible are all paths to corruption. Quite aside from the malevolency and manipulation of Daemons and their mortal followers, there is immense danger in exposure to the substance of the warp itself. The swirling tempest of psychoactive energies and pseudo-matter that make up the fabric of warp space is more deadly than any radiation. It can instantly destroy, but it can also inflict hideous transformations on material, body and mind, far beyond anything found in a sane universe. To most, corruption is a doom to be avoided at all costs, but some, once they find themselves walking the path to damnation, will seek to embrace the darkness.

# **CORRUPTION POINTS**

All Acolytes sooner or later gain Corruption Points (CP). Corruption Points operate almost exactly like Insanity Points, except that they are gained through exposure to the warp, dark rituals, cursed artefacts and Daemonic influence. The more Corruption Points a character has, the more afflicted he becomes; this is reflected in the rules by the risk of Malignancies and Mutation as shown on **Table 8-7: The Corruption Track**.

**Chaos and the Common Citizen** The rules for Corruption presented here are for use with Player Characters; Acolytes are men and women of destiny and purpose—exactly the sort of people that the Ruinous Powers seek to slowly corrupt and toy with. For most, the touch of Chaos brings summary destruction, madness, mutation and death.

# **MORAL THREATS**

The exact level of Corruption Points inflicted by a particular event, revelation or encounter is determined by the GM. The following presents some guidelines:

# **Warp Shock**

If a character suffers Insanity Points resulting from a failed Fear Test involving entities from the warp, the number of Corruption Points inflicted on him are equal to the being's Fear Rating score (i.e. Frightening 2 equals 2 CP).

# **Rending the Veil**

Characters caught in a full-blown intrusion of the warp into corporeal reality gain Corruption Points from the experience. Just how many depends on what occurs and the severity of the breach. This might be anywhere from a single point to several d10s in value.

### **Sorcery**

The practice of sorcery, witnessing dread rituals and invoking Daemons are all causes of Corruption, regardless of the reason. Normally minor rituals cause 1d10 Corruption Points and major ceremonies can cause many more.

# **Blasphemous Lore**

Knowledge itself can corrupt, and the study of certain tomes, pict-logs and even some debased artwork can cause Corruption in the viewer.

# **Dark Deeds**

Evil acts done in the furtherance of a malignancy, or in pursuit of forbidden lore, or done to appease a Daemon always cause Corruption Points.

# **Vile Persuasion**

Many Daemons and cult leaders are masters of insidious temptation and of sowing the seeds of doubt in a faithful heart. Their words and arguments can corrupt where force alone would fail.

Damned—Character removed from play
# **THE MALIGNANCY TEST**

For every 10 Corruption Points a character gains, he must Test Willpower to see if his corruption has manifested as literal damage to his body and soul. This roll is modified depending on the number of CPs the character already possesses as noted on **Table 8-7: The Corruption Track**. If the Test is failed, the character's corruption of spirit is given form. These metaphysical and psychosomatic scars are called Malignancies, and are randomly rolled on **Table 8-8: Malignancies**. If a player rolls a result that he has previously suffered for failing a previous Malignancy Test, he must roll again.

| Table 8–8: Malignancies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |

| 01–10                   | Palsy: The character suffers from numerous minor tics, shakes and tremors with no medical cause. Reduce his Agility by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| 11–15                   | Dark-hearted: The character grows increasingly cruel, callous and vindictive. Reduce his Fellowship by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| 16–20                   | Ill-fortuned: Whenever the character uses a Fate Point roll a d10. On a score of 7, 8, 9 or 10 it has no effect but it is lost anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |     |
| 21–22                   | Skin Afflictions: The character is plagued by boils, scabs, weeping sores and the like. He takes a –20penalty to all Charm Tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
| 23–25                   | Night Eyes: Light pains the character, and unless he shields his eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty on all Testswhen in an area of bright light.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| 26–30                   | Morbid: The character finds it hard to concentrate as his mind is filled with macabre visions and tortured, gloom-filled trains of thought. The character's Intelligence is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| 31–33                   | Witch-mark: The character develops some minor physical deformity or easily concealable mutation. It is small, but perhaps enough to consign him to the stake if found out by a fanatical witch hunter. He must hide it well!                                                                                                                        |     |
| 34–45                   | Fell Obsession: This is the same as the Obsession Disorder (see page 237). However, in this case the character is obsessed by a sinister or malign focus, such as collecting finger-bone trophies, ritual scarification, carrying out meaningless vivisections, etc.                                                                                |     |
| 46–50                   | Hatred: The character develops an implacable hatred of a single group, individual or social class. The character will never side with or aid them without explicit orders or other vital cause, and even then grudgingly.                                                                                                                           |     |
| 51–55                   | Irrational Nausea: The character feels sick at the sight or sound of some otherwise innocuous thing such as prayer books and holy items, bare flesh, human laughter, fresh food, shellfish, etc. When he encounters the object of his revulsion, he must Test Toughness or suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests as long as he remains in its presence. |     |
| 56–60                   | Wasted Frame: The character's pallor becomes corpse-like and his muscles waste away. The character's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     |
|                         | Strength is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| 61–63                   | Night Terrors: The character is plagued by Daemonic visions in his sleep. See Horrific Nightmares, page237 for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |
| 64–70                   | Poor Health: The character constantly suffers petty illnesses and phantom pains, and his wounds neverseem to heal fully. The character's Toughness is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                              |     |
| 71–75                   | Distrustful: The character cannot conceal the distrust and antipathy he has for others. He must take a –10 penalty to Fellowship Tests when dealing with strangers.                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
| 76–80                   | Malign Sight: The world seems to darken, tarnish and rot if the character looks too long at anything. Thecharacter's Perception is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
| 81–83                   | Ashen Taste: Food and drink hold disgusting tastes and little sustenance for the character, and he can barely stomach eating. The character doubles the negative effects for levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| 84–90                   | Bloodlust: Murderous rage is never far from the character's mind. After being wounded in combat, he must Test Willpower to incapacitate or allow his enemies to flee, rather than kill them outright, even if his intent is otherwise.                                                                                                              |     |
| 91–93                   | Blackouts: The character suffers from inexplicable blackouts. When they occur and what happens during them is up to the GM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
| 94–00                   | Strange Addiction: The character is addicted to some bizarre and unnatural substance, such as eating rose petals, drinking blood, the taste of widows' tears etc. This acts like a Minor Compulsion (see Disorders, page 237), but is freakish enough to cause serious suspicion if found out.                                                      |     |

# **MUTATION**

A character's Corruption Points total is also used to determine the warping effects of Chaos upon his body. As his Corruption builds, his flesh may revolt, twisted by the Dark Gods. Of course, such is the insidious nature of Chaos that it is constantly hunting for weakness in mind and body, testing a character's defences until it can find a way into his soul. For every 30 Corruption Points a character gains, he must make a Test against two Characteristics of his choice or suffer a random Minor Mutation (see **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists**). He may not Test against the same Characteristics twice to resist mutation. A player should make a note on his Character Sheet of which Characteristics he has already Tested to resist mutation.

# **Example**

*Havelock has 31 Corruption Points and must make a Test to resist mutation. He chooses to Test against his Strength and his Fellowship, two of his best Characteristics. If he fails either roll, he will gain a random mutation. If Havelock reaches 61 Corruption Points or more, he will need to Test once again against two Characteristics of his choice to avoid mutation. However, as he has already used his Strength and Fellowship to resist mutation he may not choose either of these.*

# **THE DARK POWERS**

*"If you stare long enough into the warp, the warp will stare back."* — Navis Nobilite saying.

B Beneath the fabric of reality lurks the warp, a realm of unspeakable horror and maddening Chaos—a realm inhabited by the Dark Powers. Since time immemorial, man has believed in the existence of spirits, gods and Daemons: otherworldly powers to be appeased, feared and bargained with. In the darkness of the 41st Millennium, such things are all too real and find fertile ground to prosper in the souls of men.

The true nature of these powers can only be guessed at, their dark names whispered by traitorous lips into heretical ears. Most of humanity knows nothing of these powers, nor would ever want to. However, their influence cannot be denied. Of all the Dark Powers, the four Chaos gods, Khorne, Tzeentch, Slaanesh and Nurgle, cast all others into shadow.

# Khorne

**The Blood God, the Skull Lord, the Master of Battle**

Khorne is the Chaos god of murder, rage and war. His great brass throne sits atop a mountainous pile of skulls, rising above an endless sea of blood. He is the Hunter of Souls and Harbinger of War, driving the frenzied servants of Chaos before him. His glory can be found in the meat-rending explosion of a bolt

shell or the wet, tearing teeth of a chainsword. His followers exist only to harvest skulls for their dark lord.

# **TZEENTCH**

**The Changer of Ways, the Master of Fortune, the Great Conspirator, the Architect of Fate**

Tzeentch is the Chaos god of change, mutation and sorcery. He waits in a place where time runs soft and wax-like, psychic energy wreathing his head like liquid smoke. Father of paradoxes and master of intrigue, he twists the strands of fate to his unknowable ends, blessing his followers with arcane power and horrific mutations.

**SLAANESH**

**The Pleasure Lord, the Prince of Pleasure, the Despoiler** Slaanesh is the Chaos god of hedonism, temptation and excess. No pleasurable pursuit is too perverse for its followers. The Golden-Haired God watches over the writhing flesh pits and ecstatic rites of its slaves, urging them on to greater depravity and debauchery in his name. Under the gleaming gaze of the Prince of Lust, his servitors weave their wicked works, luring pure souls into heinous debasement.

# **NURGLE**

**The Lord of Pestilence, the Great Corruptor, the Master of Plague, the Fly Lord**

Nurgle is the Chaos god of decay, disease and entropy. Spreader of disease and Father of Decay, Grandfather Nurgle gathers all in his rotting embrace. His leprous kisses swell in the fullness of time, to glorious pus-flowers, the marks of his favoured children. His laughter echoes across the blasted battlefields of

the Imperium with only the bloated corpses of the dead to hear it.

**Table 8-9: Signs of the Dark Gods** details some of the colours, symbols, emotions and other aspects associated with each of the Chaos gods. GMs can use this information to add tell-tale details to locations and cultists, such as the eight brass rings that would be worn by a servant of Khorne or the great golden serpent sculpture that would dominate a Slaaneshi cult temple.

# **A Warning to the Curious**

The use of Dark Pacts in the game is optional and should be decided upon by the GM who always has the final say in their use and application. GMs should always consider their potential effects on their games and group, and whether they are going to handle them openly or secretly during the game. Players should never take the step of entering a Pact lightly and should always consider that, as well as offering benefits for a character, pacts also have very substantial liabilities and ultimately will probably destroy them. Despite their potential difficulties, Dark Pacts add a fantastic extra layer of intrigue and depth to the game, and they afford a treasure-trove of role playing opportunities, plot hooks, motivations and goals for Player Characters and GMs alike. They also offer a perfect accompaniment to the themes of Dark Heresy itself, where no one is immune to the lure of Chaos, not even the Acolytes.

It should almost go without saying that Dark Heresy is just a game, and as such is meant to be enjoyable fun. The things depicted in it do not exist. However, if you do not want your players to get drawn into the temptations of Chaos, steer clear.

# **SERVANTS OF THE DARK GODS**

The gods of Chaos interact with the materium through a myriad of warp entities and Daemonic servants. Taking many forms and guises, these creatures appear to mortals, spreading their taint throughout the worlds of the Imperium. Dealing with Daemons is a dangerous affair, as they are natural deceivers, quite capable of hiding their true master or even their Daemonic nature if it serves their own ends.

Most who seek the favour of these terrible beings inevitably fall into ruin and madness, their weak flesh twisted and their souls snuffed out, becoming little more than pawns in the Daemon's plans. Some, however, prosper in the dark light of Chaos, striking Dark Pacts with these creatures of the warp.

# **DARK PACTS**

There are numerous ways that Acolytes might take to make Dark Pacts. However, it is not simply enough to desire a pact with Dark Powers; you must also have an opportunity to make one. This can occur by a number of means such as the performance of a secret ritual, travelling to a particular accursed location or gaining possession of a particular item (or a combination of all three!). An Acolyte may discover these means quite coincidentally during the course of play (through items confiscated from cultists for example), or they may actively seek them out of their own accord. This search is never easy and a Forbidden Lore (Daemons) Test or

specifically applied Investigation skill Test is required. This quest should be handled in concert with the GM, and may indeed form a mini-adventure in itself for the character.

# **Pacts Sought After**

These are the classic circumstances in which Dark Pacts are made. Through the use of forbidden knowledge or dark myth, a Daemon or other entity is called on by a character and bargained with for power or aid. The more corrupted and powerful the character, the more likely their chances for success.

# **Opportunistic Pacts**

Often this takes the form of an approach by a Daemon to the character. This might be because of the character's level of Corruption (see **[page 238](#page-238-0)**) or because the GM deems it appropriate. Visions on the point of death, dream sending or a Daemonic visitation when a Psychic Power goes horribly wrong are all possible ways for such offers to be made. In these cases, the Daemon itself is trying to actively ensnare the character, and the Pact is almost certain to succeed if the character agrees.

# **Blasphemous Locations**

There are some places where the veil between reality and the warp stretches thin. In such places Daemons await and darkness listens; here forbidden rituals find favour and myths gather. Ancient ruins, sites of Chaos atrocity and murder, forgotten hulks and dead worlds once lost and saturated in the warp, all might provide locations where a character could lose their soul.

# **STRIKING THE BARGAIN**

Once the character has found the means to make the Pact, they must formulate and chance the bargain itself. What a player asks for from a Dark Pact should be based on their character's motivations for striking the bargain in the first place. The best thing is for the player to write down a list of "wants". These should be in broad descriptive terms and never involve specific game mechanics. Pacts should be about role playing and character goals and not naked power gaming (i.e. you may say "Grant me the skill and power to avenge myself on Vathek the Defiler and his murderous cult", but you cannot ask for a "+20 bonus in WS and BS and an extra combat Talent"). The trick here is for a player to keep his wants fairly easily expressed and clear. The more he demands, the higher the cost.

# **YOUR DEAL WITH DARKNESS**

Once the bargain is successfully entered into, the GM should either agree to your list of wants or offer their own counter-proposals on behalf of the Daemon. These, along with a descriptive set of costs which the Daemon imposes for its agreement, should be presented to the player. At the GMs discretion he may allow players to use Social skills such as Charm to try and gain favourable terms with a Daemon, though such Tests should always be Very Hard. Once an agreement is struck, the GM should work out the game effects they impose and what powers and effects (called boons) they will grant; the more powerful the aid, the more costly the bargain should be. A Pact may have more than one boon, but for each boon there should be an associated cost (see **Counting the Cost, [page 244](#page-244-0)**).

In order to help you out in crafting your own Dark Pacts, the section that follows provides extensive details on five iconic types of Dark Pact and their potential boons (which are by no means exclusive).

# **PACT OF SURVIVAL**

*"Release me from the weakness of this flesh and let me live!"*

Ironically there are those who are willing to bargain their souls to preserve their mortal lives, either through fear of dying or burning hatred for the living. Typically this Pact restores a dying, crippled or aged character to full health and vigour, and may grant additional boons of unnatural life.

**Infernal Vitality:** The character counts as having the Unnatural Toughness (×2) trait in the case of resisting poisons and diseases.

**Unsettling Recovery:** If the character takes Damage but is not killed by it, then he recovers from all Damage suffered within a day. Any effect of Critical Damage that do not result in the loss of limb or death turn out to be "not as bad as it looks". Remove all Damage and Characteristic Damage after rest. For a day or so, once healed, the character experiences vast hunger, especially for fresh meat.

**Leech Life Force:** The character can steal the life force of living things. When the character deals Damage using his bare hands (or teeth), he steals life energy from his victim. Any Damage he deals instantly repairs any Damage he himself has suffered. Excess points count as temporary Wounds, allowing the character to take more Damage than he otherwise could. A character with this boon cannot gain more than twice his starting Wounds. Temporary Wounds fade after one hour. In order to further this regrowth process, the character must consume a large amount of blood. In all cases, leeching life force is instantly and completely addictive.

**Timeless:** The character does not age and, if elderly, he slowly regresses physically over time to how he was when he was at his most vigorous. The character only needs to spend two Fate Points to avoid certain death, as opposed to burning one Fate Point.

# **PACT OF DOMINION**

*"Whether by fear or love I care not; so long as they obey me!"*

Of all the Pacts brokered with the warp, none is so common a bargain as that which gives the petitioner power over their fellow man. A character with such a Pact seems favoured by chance and destiny, and is meant for great things. He has the respect of his peers and those above him, and is preferred for promotion and recognition over his contemporaries. Even in the case of failure or folly, blame is more likely to be given to others or to circumstance than the broker of the Pact. For many though, mere favour is not enough and such a character will require more direct boons to master his fellows.

**An Eye for Weakness:** The character may Test Intelligence to discover with perfect accuracy whether someone is lying and to gauge their emotional state.

**Commanding Presence:** The character is always treated with respect by everyone he meets and never suffers a negative modifier to any Fellowship Test to Command, Charm or Intimidate others.

**Unquestionable Order:** The character may spend a Fate Point to make a command that must be obeyed if the subject is able and it is within their rational bounds. This is an order that the subject is inclined to follow without question, not mind control. So, for example, the character could order an elite guard to release a prisoner, but could not order the guard to shoot himself.

**Destiny Writ in Shadows:** Dark forces conspire to aid and protect the character. Every time the character spends a Fate Point, the GM makes a percentile roll. If it is less than the character's current number of Corruption Points the character recovers the Fate Point immediately.

# **PACT OF VENGEANCE**

*"Their destruction will be mine, whatever the cost!"*

When those who you hate are so protected it seems that they cannot be touched, what choice is there? This Pact sustains and empowers a character to destroy the specific target of his personal hatred. As such, a Pact of Vengeance must be made against a distinct group of people or a specific, named individual (such as, for example, all those who bear the blood of the Sinderfell family, the crime-lord Pater Telos or the cult of the Artisans of Pain). When rolling for Damage against the subjects of his vengeance, the character may always opt to reroll a Damage result, and may spend Fate Points to add 10 to the Damage. Additionally, this Pact might grant further boons.

**Death by a Single Word:** The character may once specify a single individual. The individual dies within 1d10 days, unless he is protected by superior powers.

**Whistle and I Shall Come:** The Daemon appears once when so called, and destroys the character's enemies. All the character must do is call when in the presence of the subjects of their vengeance. (See **Invoking the Daemon, [page 244](#page-244-0)** for more details).

**A Reckoning:** The character can specify a single person who is the subject of his vengeance and within a month events transpire so that he encounters them in person if at all possible.

**Dark Power:** The player may wish for strength and power to defeat his enemies by his own hands; this might mean Characteristic increases, gaining additional Talents and even acquiring new traits. If this boon is granted it should always have a heavy cost, or take a sinister and terrible form such as mutation or possession.

# **PACT OF DESIRE**

*"Grant me my heart's desire!"*

To obtain the seemingly unobtainable, there are some who are willing to traffic with dark things and make terrible bargains for what to others might seem vain and empty goals. But be careful what you wish for…

**Creating Perfection:** The character may specify a particular task that he wishes to undertake, such as sculpting a statue or writing a book, and succeed in it to such a degree that the result is "perfect". Given such perfection's source, however, the work may have unforeseen side effects, and may be too much for mortals to bear, irrevocably tainted or extremely dangerous (works of art that drive the viewer mad and the like).

**Goods & Chattels:** The character may specify something he desires, such as a particular object, fame, title, deed or wealth, and he comes into its possession, fate itself seeming to conspire to make it so. The exact mechanism of how this is accomplished is up to the GM, but as the boon is the gift of a Daemon, somebody, somewhere should suffer as a result.

**Mastery:** The character may select a single Skill over which he gains complete Mastery. From this point on, he never suffers negative modifiers when using the Skill. Also, if he spends a Fate Point, he automatically succeeds at a Test of this Skill.

# **PACT OF KNOWLEDGE**

*"Show me… everything!"*

Lust for knowledge may draw a character to forbidden lore and things that "man was not meant to know". From there, it is but a short step to desiring more such knowledge, blind to the price that he and others must pay. Upon the granting of this Pact, a character knows everything about a particular subject if that knowledge is knowable at all (enough to grant them a +20 bonus to the associated Skill). Alternately, there are other ways a Pact of Knowledge can manifest.

**Show Me:** The character gains the powers of a seer, and is able to see clairvoyant visions (of distant or hidden people, places, events and so on). These visions may be limited in scope to things present, past or of possible future, and by other occult factors. The more powerful the boon of vision, the more costly to the character it will be. The visions are always experienced in the same way, in a manner particular to the character, as images captured in a reflected surface or as a sudden painful delirium, for example. The character must spend a Fate Point to see such a vision wilfully.

**True Savant:** The character may make any Lore Test as if he has that Skill, and may re-roll any Test for a Lore skill that he is learned in.

**Monstrous Memory:** The character remembers everything and gains complete and perfect recall of his life up to that point.

**Knowledge Familiar:** The character is gifted a familiar that answers questions put to it with complete truth (although perhaps grudgingly). The familiar requires payment for each question asked before it answers. Payment varies but examples might include an eye or tongue, a piece of the questioner's flesh, or an object of beauty it might destroy. The familiar itself may be a conjured creature or may appear to be something innocuous, such as a small statue of black glass, a strange portrait or a clockwork artefact.

# **DARK PACTS AND CORRUPTION**

Entering into a Dark Pact is a stain on a character's soul that will never be clean again, and even attempting such a thing is an unforgivably foul act. Conversely, if a Pact is successful, the character will gain some small measure of control over the warp taint infesting him, and indeed will become less subject to its more minor effects.

A character that successfully enters into a Dark Pact gains +20 Corruption Points to a maximum total of 90 points. GMs may elect to increase this dependent on the nature and benefits of the Pact.

A character with a Dark Pact is shielded somewhat from the effects of petty corruptions and low levels of warp contamination after it takes effect. He halves the result of any randomly rolled Corruption Points inflicted on him (rounding fractions down).

# **THE MASK OF SEEMING**

Daemons mask their grip on their victim's souls, hiding the corruption within from prying eyes and psychic probing. Any attempt to ascertain the effects of corruption, warp taint or possession against a character with a Dark Pact by Divination, Psyniscience, or Telepathy suffers a -30 penalty.

# **INVOKING THE DAEMON**

In addition to the boons of their Pact, a character may seek to invoke his patron Daemon directly to appear and aid him; this is an act of desperation and incredibly dangerous. Invoking the Daemon requires the burning of a Fate Point and succeeding on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test. If successful, an incarnation or greater servant of the Daemon appears (treat this as an unbound Daemonhost), and the character gains 1d10 Corruption Points. The incarnation is more or less inclined to help the character, although the character has no direct control over it, and it will depart once the immediate encounter is over.

How fellow Acolytes react to this "help" is another matter.

# **COUNTING THE COST**

Dark Pacts always have a terrible price. GMs are encouraged to be creative with the costs the character must pay, both in terms of liabilities and the demands of his new patron. As a basic guideline, for each boon a Pact grants there should be a cost. Some basic examples of costs are presented here: in the first instance, service is a common feature of most Pacts; while in the second, fealty is the price of many Pacts that offer major power.

### **Service**

The character must serve his patron's needs and designs as best he is able, and the terms of this service should be laid down during the initial bargain, making the Acolyte in essence a double-agent for his new Daemonic patron. His Daemon may communicate its desires to the Acolyte at will through any number of occult and esoteric means, though his master's goals are far from transparent; indeed Daemons are inconstant and they fashion labyrinthine plots that few mortals can grasp. Worse, they ceaselessly war and scheme against their own hellish kind, and who better to persecute such conflicts than an Inquisitorial Acolyte whose allegiance has been turned?

# **Fealty**

The Acolyte has sold his soul to his dark patron to be collected upon his death. The light of the Emperor is denied him. Such characters gain no benefit from blessings, faith healing and other holy effects, nor regain sanity through prayer and fasting.

# **Sacrifice**

An initial sacrifice may be demanded by the Daemon before the Pact takes effect. This may take the form of an inflicted malignancy of a type favoured by the Daemon, periodic possession, or the death or betrayal of a companion or loved one. Alternatively, the Daemon might demand that the character perform some criminal act that suits its plans or successfully undertake a dangerous task in its service.

# **Observance**

The Daemon may require that regular rituals, oblation or other strange observances be performed in its name. Failure to do so will incur its displeasure.

# **DENYING THE DAEMON**

If you deny the Daemon its price after the bargain is struck, or betrays its interests, it violently withdraws its patronage, inflicting a malignancy and instantly undoing the Pact's boons. Daemons are spiteful beings and rarely simply kill those that have betrayed them, and the GM may wish to ensure that a complex and terrible vengeance ensues.

# **Masters of Corruption**

Many are the Daemons and dread entities that enter into Dark Pacts with mortals to corrupt and enslave them. Here are three examples:

**Balphomael:** Said to take shape as a great horned man as dark as the void with eyes of flame, this Daemon grants power, wealth, long-life and unnatural vitality to those hungry and ruthless enough to gain his favour. Souls are Balphomael's only currency, worship his due and murder his delight. Old myths, occult lexicons and forbidden records scattered across the Calixis Sector make much of the "horned darkness", and some whisper that many great and noble families owe their position to his shadowy ministry.

**The Lord of Misrule:** Tales of the Lord of Misrule are woven into the folklore of a dozen worlds, and the truth of his existence are shuttered in the proscribed vaults of the Inquisition. Fickle, manic and terrifying, the Lord of Misrule brings anarchy and madness in his wake. This strange figure is said to speak through the babblings of lunatics, the drunkard's slur and the last gasps of the dying. Appearing to those on the edge of death or who suffer as outcasts, only the most desperate take up his riddling bargains and those in his service quickly come to regret accepting his aid.

**The Dusk Hag:** On the accursed world of Dusk, a dark legend speaks of the Hag. Black Annaiys, Old Mother Ruin and a hundred other names she has, and if you should risk the journey into the deepest, most trackless swamps with hatred and desire burning in your heart, you might come to the black hollow where she dwells. It is said that her price is paid in flesh, sinew and bone, but her curses can strike death and terror worlds away, and all the secrets that men whisper in the night are hers. Just a legend perhaps, on a world shrouded in countless dark fables, but still petitioners seek her out and some return, maimed and mutilated, but filled with dark purpose.
