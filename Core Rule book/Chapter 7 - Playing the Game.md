*"You have been chosen to serve the God-Emperor of Mankind with your very lives! But before you are even worthy to honour Him with your demise there are some things you need to know..."* — Inquisitor Saffena Sengir, Ordo Xenos.

I I n the service of the Holy Inquisition, Acolytes are called upon to perform all manner of tasks, such as rooting out heretics, travelling through the warp and combating the many foes of mankind. To achieve these things, characters need to draw upon all their skills and abilities. Having created your character, this chapter explores all the different sorts of things your Acolyte might have to do in the service of the God-Emperor.

*"There is nothing to fear but failure."*

— Warmaster Slaydo.

A As your Acolyte undertakes adventures, explores strange environments and exposes villainy, he will engage in all manner of actions. Shooting a lasgun, scaling a cliff wall, avoiding the power sword of a heretic: these are just a sample of the typical sorts of things your character might face in his service to an Inquisitor. While it might be sufficient to say that you can or cannot achieve these things, Dark Heresy uses a system for resolving the challenges that characters must overcome during game play.

The basic way of determining success or failure is determined by what is called a "Test". Whenever the action, task or effort could have dramatic consequences—things that affect the story, your character's health and so on—you must take a Test. To do so make a percentile dice roll. See **Reading and Rolling the Dice** on **[page 9](#page-9-0)** for more information on how to do this. Now compare the result rolled to the Characteristic that best describes the action you're attempting. If you roll lower than or equal to the Characteristic, you succeed. If you roll higher than the Characteristic, you fail.

**If the d100 roll is greater than the Characteristic, you fail. If the d100 roll is equal to or less than the Characteristic, you succeed.**

# Skill Tests 
The most common sorts of Tests you have to take during play are Skill Tests. Every skill (see **Chapter III: Skills**) is governed by a particular Characteristic. For example, the Agility Characteristic governs the Dodge skill. Whenever you would use a Skill—again, for any Action with dramatic consequences—you make a Skill Test, making a percentile dice roll as described above.

# **Example**

*Drake, a Veteran Guardsman with Agility 34, fights a hive ganger. The unwashed hive scum makes a successful attack with his lead pipe. Drake has the Dodge skill, so he tries to get out of the way. Drake's player makes a Dodge Test, rolling 42 on his percentile dice. Since this is over Drake's Agility characteristic, the ill-fated Guardsman fails and the ganger's weapon strikes home.*

You can sometimes make Skill Tests even when you do not actually have the Skill. You can only make Skill Tests with Skills you do not have if the Skill is a Basic Skill. Advanced Skills require specialised training and experience. If you don't have the Advanced Skill, you can't make the attempt.

When making a Skill Test with a Basic Skill you do not have, roll as normal, but halve the Characteristic (round up).

Many Talents (see **Chapter IV: Talents**) can improve your chances of success, as can Skill Mastery (see **[page](#page-96-0)**  <span id="page-183-0"></span>**[96](#page-96-0)**). Talented, for example, provides a +10 bonus on Skill Tests made with any one Skill.

# **Example**

*Nursing a nasty lump on his head, Drake tries to bargain down the price of a medi-kit from a local hive merchant. He doesn't have the Barter skill, but Barter is a Basic Skill so he can give it a try anyway. Drake has a Fellowship 34, but he must halve it because he doesn't have the skill. He must roll below or equal to 17 (34/2=17) to successfully haggle the price down. Drake rolls a 15—a success! He has managed to convince the merchant to lower the price.*

# Characteristic Tests

Sometimes you may want to do something that is not covered by a Skill (using brute force to knock down a door, for example). In these cases, you make a Characteristic Test instead of a Skill Test. The GM determines the most appropriate Characteristic for what you're trying to do. Then roll a percentile dice and compare the roll to the Characteristic. As with Skill Tests, if the roll is equal to or less than the Characteristic you succeed; if the roll is greater than the Characteristic you fail.

# **Example**

*Kiera, a Death Cult Assassin, runs across a narrow gantry high above a space port in the driving rain. The gantry is very narrow and extremely slippery, but with the Crimson Alliance in pursuit, Kiera is not going to slacken her pace. The GM calls for an Agility Test. Kiera's Agility is 37. She rolls the dice and gets a 26, enough to safely cross the gantry, leaving her enemies behind.*

# **Using Characteristics**

For everything not covered by Skills, you should always fall back to Characteristic Tests. See **Table 7–1: Characteristic Tests** for examples of typical Characteristics Tests.

# **Characteristic Bonuses**

Except for Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill, all Characteristics have an associated bonus. The Characteristic Bonus is equal to the tens digit of the Characteristic. For example, Jonas has a 45 Toughness, so his Toughness Bonus is 4. Adriel has a 36 Perception, so her Perception Bonus is 3. Since these bonuses are determined by the Characteristic, they may rise and fall throughout the adventure. Should a Characteristic take a penalty, that penalty likewise applies to the Characteristic Bonus.

# **Example**

*Drake, who's Toughness is 45, is suffering from poisoning, and therefore takes a –10 penalty to all Toughness Tests. This means that his Toughness functions as if it is 35. Thus Drake's Toughness Bonus, for as long as he takes the penalty, is reduced to 3.*

# **Using Characteristic Bonuses**

Characteristic Bonuses are used in a number of ways. Usually they are added to a dice roll to give a modified result. For example, to ascertain the Damage inflicted by a successful attack with a club, you roll 1d10 and add your Strength Bonus (1d10+SB).

| Table 7–2: Characteristic Bonuses |                                                          |  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Characteristic                    | Example Tests                                            |  |
| Strength Bonus                    | Used to determine Damage from meleeattacks.          |  |
| Toughness                         | Used to resist Damage taken in combat.                   |  |
| Agility                           | Used to determine Initiative.                            |  |
| Intelligence                      | Used with Skills, the Medicae skill forexample.      |  |
| Perception                        | Used with Skills, the Psyniscience skillfor example. |  |
| Willpower                         | Used with Focus Power to manifest                        |  |
|                                   | Psychic Powers.                                          |  |
| Fellowship                        | Used when interacting with people.                       |  |

**"Mankind stands upon the brink; on the one hand lies a realm of unimaginable power, on the other awaits darkness, death and utter damnation. Only those that follow the guiding light of the Emperor may save their souls."**

Sometimes you will be asked to add or subtract a number from a Characteristic Bonus before you apply it to a result. For example, to ascertain the Damage inflicted by a successful hammer attack, you roll 1d10 and add your Strength Bonus minus one (1d10+SB-1).

In addition, Characteristic Bonuses can be used to break ties—see **Opposed Skill Tests** for more details.

# **DEGREES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE**

For most tests, it is enough to know whether you succeeded or failed. Sometimes, however, it is useful to know how well you succeeded, or how badly you failed. This is particularly important with social skills like Charm and Inquiry, as it gives the GM a guideline to help determine Non-Player Character (NPC) attitudes and to portion out the information attained.

Measuring degrees of success and failure is straightforward. Compare the result of your Test with your score. For each full 10 points by which you exceed your Characteristic, you achieve one degree of success. Conversely, for each full 10 points by which you fail, you gain one degree of failure. Your GM will let you know if degrees of success or failure are important for a particular Test.

# **Example**

*Father Horst is boasting, none too truthfully, of his success in smiting mutants. He makes a Deceive Test. Since Deceive is a Fellowship-based skill, Father Horst must roll beneath his Fellowship Characteristic to successfully convince the drill-abbots that his actions were indeed "like the Imperial heroes of old". Horst rolls 12 against a Fellowship of 44. Not only does he succeed, he beats his target by 3 degrees of success (44–12 = 32). The Drill-Abbots completely believe his tale and decide that, as Horst is such a hero, he is best employed at the front line of a local war.*

# Extended Tests 

Some tasks are quite complicated and may take extra time to finish. In these cases, the GM may decide that it takes more than one successful Skill Test to complete the task. This is known as an Extended Test. Generally, the Skill in question will describe whether it requires an Extended Test, though the GM may adjust the time represented by each Test depending on what is in fact being attempted.

# Opposed Skill Tests 

Sometimes you have to Test your Skill against that of an opponent. This is known as an Opposed Skill Test. If you were trying to hide from a searching Guardsman, for example, you would make a Concealment Test, while the Guardsman would make an Awareness Test. In these situations, both

parties make Skill Tests as normal. Whoever succeeds on the Test wins. If both participants succeed, the one with the most degrees of success wins. If the degrees of success are the same, the higher Characteristic Bonus wins out. And if this still results in a tie, then the lowest dice roll wins.

Should both parties fail, one of two things occurs. Either there is a stalemate and nothing happens or both parties should re-roll until there is a clear winner.

# **Example**

*Having eluded the Crimson Alliance on the gantry, Kiera is now trying to sneak out of the space port and past one of their sentries. The GM calls for a Silent Move Test and opposes it with the sentry's Perception Test. Both the player and the GM roll. Kiera must roll below 37 and the sentry must roll below 30. Kiera rolls a 24 for a success, while the GM gets a 28, also a success. Kiera beat her number by 13 while the sentry beat his only by 2. As Kiera has the greater degree of success, she manages to slip past and off into the night.*

# **THE ROLE OF CIRCUMSTANCE**

Not all Skill Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is quite easy, for instance, but ascending the face of a sheer cliff is quite difficult. The GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Skill or Characteristic Tests depending on the circumstances. While published adventures define these modifiers for the GM, there are many instances where the GM has to determine them on the wing. Making judgements like this is a big part of being a Game Master.

For each Test, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult **Table 7–3: Test Difficulty** to determine the appropriate modifier. GMs may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in extremely unusual situations. It is recommended that all modifiers be given out in 10-point increments to keep the numbers simple. GMs who prefer more finesse, however, may hand out modifiers in 5-point increments.

# **Example**

*Vos, a Feral warrior, tries to find the tracks of an unruly Grox he is hunting. He makes a Tracking Test. Under normal circumstances, he'd simply use his Intelligence Characteristic as his base chance of success. However, the GM decides that the rain last night washed away most of the tracks. He deems the task Very Hard and imposes a –30 penalty on Vos's Skill Test. His Intelligence is 41, with the penalty, he has to roll under an 11 (41–30=11) to succeed. Vos rolls a 35, which would have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this instance the rain foiled him and the test is failed. To make matters worse, Vos failed the Test by more than 20, so the GM rules that he becomes lost for 1d5 hours.*

# **ASSISTANCE**

In some situations, multiple characters working together have a better chance of completing the task than if a character attempts it alone. With the GM's permission, a character can assist another character that's taking a Test. When doing so, the character with the best chance to succeed rolls the dice. Each character assisting reduces the Difficulty by one step. If the Test succeeds, the character who rolled the dice gains an extra degree of success.

| Table 7-3: Test Difficulty |               |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Difficulty                 | Test Modifier |
| Easy                       | +30           |
| Routine                    | +20           |
| Ordinary                   | +10           |
| Challenging                | +0            |
| Difficult                  | –10           |
| Hard                       | –20           |
| Very Hard                  | –30           |

# **Limits on Assistance**

Characters can assist each other in most tasks but there are limits:

- To assist, both characters must have the Skill being Tested.
- The assisting character must be adjacent to the character taking the Test.
- You cannot assist on Reactions or Free Actions.
- •Youmaynot assistonTestsmade toresistdisease,poison,Fear, hazards or anything else the GM deems inappropriate.
- No more than two characters may attempt to assist another.

# **Example**

*Hannah and Boris search a room. The GM declares that a Challenging (+0) Search Test is required, so Boris decides to help Hannah rather than search on his own. Since Boris is helping, the Difficulty drops to Ordinary (+10). If Hannah, who has the higher Perception, succeeds, she gains an extra degree of success because of Boris's help.*

# The role of Fate
*"There is no fate, but what the Emperor makes."* — Catechism of the Founding, Gunmetallicus 104th.

A All Player Characters begin play with a number of Fate Points. The number of Fate Points a character receives is decided during character creation. Fate Points are what separates Acolytes from the ordinary people of the Imperium. PCs have destinies and the Emperor has marked them for greater things. While their ultimate fate is a mystery, with no guarantees that it will be glorious, enriching or pleasant, they are a cut above the rest.

# Using Fate Points

Fate Points allow you to turn luck to your advantage, hitting with that bolter shot when you would have otherwise missed, or cracking the security code on a door just in time to make a hasty escape. Using these twists of fate, you can take a few more risks, which makes the game faster and far more exciting than would otherwise be the case.

That said, you have a limited pool of Fate Points and whenever you spend a Fate Point, you reduce your pool by one, so choose wisely. Fate Points are restored at the start of the next gaming session. Spending a Fate Point allows a character to do one of the following things:

- Re-roll any one failed Test. The results of the re-roll are final.
- Count as having rolled a 10 for their Initiative.
- Add an extra degree of success to a Test.
- Instantly recover 1d5 Wounds.
- Recover from being Stunned.

# Burning Fate

Sometimes a re-roll or an extra degree of success is not going to be enough to save a character's life. In these instances, the character may choose to burn a Fate Point and permanently reduce their Fate Points by 1. The result is that the character survives whatever it was that would have killed him, but only just. So for example, if the character was shot with a lascannon and suffered a Critical Hit that would have killed him, instead he will only be horribly wounded, hideously burnt and rendered unconscious on 0 Wounds. In more extreme circumstances, such as being trapped on a space ship during a warp drive implosion, it is up to the player and the GM to work out just how the character makes his escape.

Note that you may burn a Fate Point even if you have already used all of your Fate Points for that gaming session. This just means that at the start of the next session, when your points are restored, you will have 1 less Fate Point.

# Gaining Additional The Role Fate Points 

Since Fate Points are an expendable resource, you may be reluctant to burn them for fear of never gaining more. However, as your character undertakes adventures, he may gain additional Fate Points to replenish those that have been burnt away. Your GM may grant Fate Points for particular acts of heroism, cunning or good role playing. See **Chapter VIII: The Game Master** for details.

**"The foolish man puts his trust in luck, the wise man puts his trust in the Emperor."**

# **INVESTIGATION**

*"Wisdom is the beginning of fear."*

— Ordos Hereticus maxim.

A Another key element of Dark Heresy games is, of course, investigation. Over the course of an adventure, you are likely to spend a fair amount of time pouring through dusty libraries, searching through forbidden texts or chatting with the locals to uncover the heresy you seek. **Chapter III: Skills** offers a number of Investigation skills, such as Inquiry, Scholastic Lore, Forbidden Lore and so on, to help you through this process.

# Using Investigation Skills 

In many cases, clues come as a result of achieving certain objectives in the game. You might travel to another planet to search through ancient xenos ruins, before heading on to a hive-city to find someone who knows a bit about what you found, only to head back to a shrine world to find the corrupted priest who heads up a cult to the Dark Powers. All of these instances can result from knowing where to look, who to talk to, and where to go once you find the information you seek. Sometimes, though, you may need to roll up your sleeves and do some digging to discover the truth. Examples of investigation could be to find out the background to a forbidden planet, to learn more information about a xenos, or to research a particularly famous figure in the history of the Imperium. Luckily, all Investigation skills work the same way.

All Investigation tests require a character to have access to an Investigation skill. The Difficulty of the Test depends on its complexity, which also determines the base time it should take to uncover the information sought. A success on the Test allows you to roll 1d10 and add the appropriate Characteristic Bonus (as determined by the Characteristic used for the Test) and subtract this value in hours from the time it takes to uncover the information sought. A failed Test indicates no progress gained. Failing by three or more degrees indicates a setback, adding 1d10 hours to the total time required by the Test. Failing by five or more degrees means that your investigation comes to a complete halt and that the information's complexity increases by two steps. Once you reduce the time to 0 or less, you get the available information on the subject you're investigating.

**Table 7–4: Investigation Benchmarks** offers a selection of example Difficulties, times and Actions based on secrecy. As with many other Tests, you may benefit from assistance from other Player Characters subject to the same limitations described under Assistance (see **Assistance, [page 184](#page-184-0)**).

Investigation should never be used to replace role playing or participating in adventures, but rather to augment role playing and assist in arriving at the facts of a matter.

*"Strike fast and suddenly. Attack without warning. Secure victory before the foe is aware of his danger. Remember always, a war is easily won if your enemy does not know he is fighting."* — *Tactica Imperialis*.

M Make no mistake: the Imperium is a dangerous place. Over the course of their investigations, explorations and travels, the characters are bound to encounter those who would see them dead. Unless the characters plan to spend their lives running away from their enemies, they will have to make a stand and fight. As a result, combat can form a key component in your Dark Heresy game. Being familiar with the ins and outs of battle can only improve your chances of survival.

# Rounds, Turns & Time

For most occasions whilst playing Dark Heresy , the GM simply describes the scene or situation and asks the players how they react. Time is flexible, and is subject to the GM's decision based on the choices the characters make. Whilst the GM should have an idea about how much time approximately passes, it's not necessary to track the passage of time down to the exact second, or even the minute or hour. It is enough to say that "it takes about an hour to reach the spectral vestibule" or "after about fifteen minutes of walking, you come upon a crashed Aquila Lander". This sort of approach is known as "game time" or "Narrative Time".

In contrast to the loose laws of Narrative Time, there are many situations when every second counts and the GM must closely monitor what is going on. It might be that the GM needs to adjudicate a furious sword fight, or to track the characters' pace as they pursue fleeing cultists through the alleys of Gunmetal City.

| Table 7-4: Investigation Benchmarks |             |          |                                        |           |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|----------|----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Complexity                          | Difficulty  | Modifier | Example                                | Time      |

When playing in such detailed moments of time, the Surprise GM must slice the action up into Rounds and Turns. A Round is approximately five seconds of Action. During a Round, participants in the encounter each have a Turn to act. Each character's Turn overlaps slightly, so Actions are almost simultaneous within the Round. Combat is the most common time that players will encounter detailed time or "Combat Time", but is by no means the only circumstance where Rounds and Turns are used. See **Movement** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)** for more details.

# **COMBAT OVERVIEW**

Each character, including NPCs, takes a Turn within the Round. It is therefore necessary to determine the order in which Actions are taken. When combat begins, follow these steps to determine what happens.

# **Step One: Surprise**

When beginning a combat, the GM determines if any of the combatants are Surprised. This only affects the first Round and isn't always necessary even then. Surprised combatants lose their Turn on the first Round of combat. They are caught unawares and their opponents get a full Round's "drop" on them. If no one is Surprised, then move immediately onto Step Two.

# **Step Two: Roll Initiative**

At the start of the first Round, each combatant must roll for Initiative. Each combatant rolls 1d10 and adds his Agility Bonus (the tens digit of his Agility characteristic). The result of the roll applies for all successive Rounds in the combat.

# **StepThree: Determine InitiativeOrder**

The GM ranks all the Initiative rolls, including those of the NPCs and creatures, from highest to lowest. This is the order that characters will act in during each Round of combat.

# **Step Four: Characters Take Turns**

Starting with the participant with the highest Initiative roll, each character takes a Turn. During his Turn, a character can perform one or more Actions. Once a character has finished his Actions, the next participant takes a Turn and so on.

# **Step Five: Round Ends**

Once each participant has taken a Turn, the Round is over.

# **Step Six: Repeat Steps Four and Five as Needed**

Continue to play successive Rounds until the combat is complete or until you finished whatever it is that triggered the switch from Narrative Time to Combat Time.

# **SURPRISE**

Surprise only affects the first Round of combat. It is up to the GM to decide if any of the combatants are Surprised. Ultimately, this comes down to a judgement call on the GM's part, based on the circumstances and the Actions of the various combatants leading up to the encounter. The GM should take the following into account when determining Surprise:

- Is anyone hiding? Successful use of the Concealment skill before the combat may mean that some combatants are hidden. Extremely wary characters may oppose this with a Perception Test.
- Is anyone sneaky? Successful use of the Silent Move skill may have positioned some characters for an ambush. Again, wary opponents may oppose this with a Perception Test.
- Are there any unusual circumstances that would mask the approach of attackers? This can cover nearly anything, from pouring rain to whining engines to nearby explosions.
- Are there any distractions? It's possible that something quite distracting is going on. A cultist's attention may be so fixated on the sermon of his confessor that he doesn't notice his attackers approaching.

Bearing all of this in mind, the GM must decide which combatants are Surprised. Whilst it's often the case that one entire side or the other is Surprised, there can be individual exceptions. For example, mutants may easily Surprise a unit of green Guardsmen, but not their keeneyed commissar.

If no one is Surprised, proceed with the combat as normal. Surprised characters lose their Turn in the first Round. They can do nothing except stand dumbfounded whilst their opponents fall upon them, with the attackers gaining +30 to hit during the first Round of combat only. After the first Round, Surprised characters recover their wits and can act normally.

# **Example**

*Having dealt with one group of cultists, Mordechai and Drake continue on their mission only to fall foul of an ambush by more members of the Barbed Chalice. The combat begins when the cultists attempt to shoot their autoguns at the Acolytes from concealed positions. The GM decides that Mordechai and Drake are Surprised. The cultists aim and shoot at the unlucky Acolytes. Since they are Surprised, Mordechai and Drake do not get a chance to act. Once the cultists have taken their shots, the Surprise Round ends. The GM starts at the top of the Initiative order for Round two and the combat proceeds as normal.*

each Round. To determine Initiative, roll 1d10 and add the result to the character or NPC's Agility Bonus. Naturally, the GM rolls the Initiative of any NPCs and creatures present.

GMs can make one Initiative roll for each group of like characters. For example, if there are three gangers in the combat, all of which have the same Characteristics, it isn't necessary to roll Initiative separately for each ganger. One roll will do for all of them and they'll act at the same time in the Initiative order.

# **Example**

*Mordechai, an Arbitrator with AB of 3 (the tens digit from his Agility of 35), rolls for Initiative when his group is attacked by three cultists of the Barbed Chalice. He rolls a 6 on a d10, so his Initiative for this combat is 9 (6+3). His companion, Drake, gets an 8 and the cultists 7. So, Mordechai goes first, followed by Drake, and then by the cultists.*

Once everyone has rolled, the GM makes a list and places each character or creature in order, from highest to lowest. This is the order the combatants act in each Round, until the combat is over.

If more than one character has the same Initiative, they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they also have the same Agility then each should roll a die, with the highest going first.

Most combats last for multiple Rounds. You only need to determine Initiative at the start of the fight, however. Once the Initiative order has been established, it remains the same from Round to Round. If new combatants join in the midst of the encounter, simply roll Initiative for them and add them to the order.

# **Example**

*The combat has been raging for three Rounds now and one of the cultists has been slain. Alerted by the noise ,a corrupt enforcer arrives to aid the cultists, so the GM rolls Initiative and gets a 7. The enforcer has 25 Agility (giving him an AB of 2), so he goes after Mordechai (Initiative roll of 7 plus Agility Bonus of 2=Initiative of 9). In the new Round, the revised Initiative order is Mordechai (9), enforcer (9), Drake (8), and finally the two remaining cultists (7).*

**"Strike fast and suddenly. Attack without warning. Secure victory before the foe is aware of his danger. Remember always, a war is easily won if your enemy does not know he is fighting."**

# **INITIATIVE** Actions Initiative determines the order in which participants act during **ACTIONS**

During each normal Round, every character gets a Turn to act. On his Turn, a character can take one or more Actions. There are five types of Actions in Dark Heresy.

# **Full Action**

A Full Action requires a character's complete attention to accomplish on his Turn. A character that takes a Full Action cannot take any Half Actions this Round.

# **Half Action**

A Half Action is fairly simple, like moving or drawing a weapon. A character can take two different Half Actions on his Turn instead of taking a Full Action.

Note that you may not take the same Half Action twice.

### **Reactions**

A Reaction is an Action that is made in response to some event such as an attack. All characters receive one Reaction each Round, which may only be used when it is not their Turn. Examples include making a Dodge Test or Parrying an attack.

## **Free Action**

A Free Action takes but a split second and so can be taken in addition to any other Actions you make in a Round. There is no formal limit to the number of Free Actions a character can make in a Round, but a GM should use common sense to set reasonable limits on what can be done in a few seconds.

# **Extended Actions**

Some Actions take more time than a single Round to complete. Once you commit yourself to an Extended Action, you are considered to be working towards completing that Action for as long as it takes. Should you be interrupted or if you abandon the Extended Action, all progress towards completing it is lost.

# **Using Actions**

Typical Actions include drawing a weapon, attacking and moving. During his Turn, a character may perform one Full Action or two different Half Actions. A character could, for example, make a charge attack (Full Action) or aim and shoot (two Half Actions). It's important to remember that a Round is only a few seconds long, so the character's Turn within that Round is but a few moments.

Any Action can be combined with talking, banter, battle cries and other short verbal expressions—these are considered Free Actions. It is left to the GM to decide what a player might be able to say in the time—obviously a terse warning or a wry aside to a comrade would be acceptable. Reciting the complete one-hundred and seventeen rules for the denunciation and chastisement of traitors to the Imperium would not be.

# **Example**

*Vos has rolled an Initiative of 11 this Round. When his Turn comes, he must decide what to do. As he has finally found the Grox he has been tracking, he decides to move up to the beast and then hack at it with his chain axe. Moving and attacking are both Half Actions, so Vos can't do anything more this Round. Once his Actions are resolved, the next combatant in Initiative order (in this case, the rather annoyed Grox, with an Initiative of 10) takes its Turn.*

Most Actions must be completed during your Turn. You can't start a charge attack in one Round and finish it on the next. Some Actions, however, take longer than a single Round to complete. These are known as Extended Actions and they are noted in the following descriptions.

Table 7-5: Combat Actions

A character attempting an Extended Action must continue with that Action until it's finished. He can't start to reload a musket, move and then finish reloading, for example. A character may abort the Action part-way through, but this means that all the time spent on it thus far is wasted.

# **Example**

*Hybris, a Tech-Priest, needs to reload his heavy stubber, which takes two Full Actions. He starts on his next Turn, taking one Full Action. On his following Turn, he finishes reloading by spending another Full Action. If he had chosen to abandon his reloading efforts after the first Round, the Extended Action would have been aborted and he'd have to start the process all over again later, if he still wanted to reload.*

# **Actions**

These Actions provide players with a variety of manoeuvres, giving their characters a range of options in combat. Actions are divided up into Attack Actions, Movement Actions and Miscellaneous Actions.

# **Attack Actions**

Attack Actions are any Action that involves attacking and damaging your opponents.

# **All Out Attack (Full Action)**

You make a furious melee attack, exposing yourself to danger in order to land a forceful blow. You gain a +20 bonus on your Weapon Skill Test, but you may not Parry or Dodge until your next Turn.

# **Charge (Full Action)**

You rush up to an opponent and deliver a single attack. The opponent must be at least 4 metres away from you, but within your Charge Move (see **Table 7-28: Movement (Metres/ Round)** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)**). The last 4 metres of the Charge must be in a straight line, so you can build up speed and line up with your opponent. You gain a +10 bonus to your Weapon Skill Test made at the end of the Charge.

# **Defensive Stance (Full Action)**

You strike no blows this Round as you concentrate on selfdefence. Until your next Turn, all opponents suffer a –20 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack you.

# **Feint (Half Action)**

You pretend to attack in one direction, deceiving your opponent and throwing off his defence. This is resolved by an Opposed Weapon Skill Test. If you win, your next attack cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a Standard Attack, you lose this advantage.

# **Full Auto Burst (Full Action)**

You hurl a burst of fully automatic fire at your opponents. You must be using a weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this Action. (See **Rate of Fire** on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**)

Your vast hail of fire grants a +20 modifier to your Ballistic Skill Test. If the ranged attack is successful, a hit is scored as normal. Furthermore, every degree of success scores an extra hit. The number of extra hits you can score in this manner may not exceed the fully automatic rate of fire for your weapon. Your extra hits can be either allocated to the original target or any other target within 2 metres (provided that the new target would not have been harder to hit). See **Table 7-6 Multiple Hits, page 190** to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Alternatively, as an optional rule, you may roll dice to determine the location of each additional hit, though doing so will slow the game down.

A result of 94 to 00 on your Ballistic Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed (see **Weapon Jams** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

If you have a pistol in either hand you may fire them both (see **Two-Weapon Fighting** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)**).

| Table 7-6: | Multiple Hits |       |        |       |                     |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ------------------- |
| Location   | Second        | Third | Fourth | Fifth | Each Additional Hit |
| Head       | Head          | Arm   | Body   | Arm   | Body                |
| Arm        | Arm           | Body  | Head   | Body  | Arm                 |
| Body       | Body          | Arm   | Head   | Arm   | Body                |
| Leg        | Leg           | Body  | Arm    | Head  | Body                |

# **Grapple (Full Action)**

Whether you are Grappling or being Grappled, you may only take the Grapple Action. If Grappling, you may make an Opposed Strength Test to injure your opponent. If you beat your opponent, you deal normal unarmed Damage (1d5–3 plus SB, with armor Points counting double) and one level of Fatigue. If your opponent wins, you deal no Damage, but your opponent is still Grappled.

If you are being Grappled, you may make an Opposed Strength Test to break free or take control of the Grapple. If you win the Test, you escape the Grapple or you begin Grappling your opponent and can now deal Damage on your next Action. See **Grappling** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)** for more information on starting a Grapple.

# **Guarded Attack (Full Action)**

You attack carefully, making sure you are well defended from counter-attacks. You make a melee attack with a –10 penalty to your Weapon Skill Test. Until your next Action, though, you gain a +10 bonus on Dodge or Parry Tests.

# **Knock-Down (Half Action)**

You smash into your opponent in the hopes of knocking him from his feet. You and your opponent make Opposed Strength Tests. If you succeed, you Knock-Down your opponent who falls to the ground and must use the Stand Action to get back to their feet. If you succeed by two or more degrees of success your opponent also takes SB–4 Damage and one level of Fatigue. If your opponent wins, he keeps his footing. If your opponent wins by two or more degrees of success and you fail, you are Knocked-Down instead. If you spent a Half Action to move first, you gain a +10 bonus to your Test.

# **Multiple Attacks (Full Action)**

If you have the Swift Attack or Lightning Attack talents, you may spend a Full Action to make multiple attacks as determined by the Talent you have. Or, if you have a weapon in your secondary hand you may also make an extra attack with this weapon (see **Two-Weapon Fighting** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)**).

# **Overwatch (Varies)**

You guard a particular area, poised to hurl an enormous volley of fire at any opponent foolish enough to approach. You must be using a weapon capable of full automatic fire to take this Action (see **Rate of Fire** on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**). Overwatch is an Extended Action, which may operate over multiple Rounds of combat.

Pick an area to watch. The size of this area, known as your kill zone, extends 45 degrees out from the direction you are facing up to half the Range of the weapon. It is often easier to say that you are covering a specific area such as a corridor, doorway or section of treeline. If there is any doubt, the GM has final say on whether a target is in your kill zone or not.

Establishing your kill zone takes a Full Turn.

Once your kill zone is established, you may spend subsequent Turns waiting for targets to enter your kill zone.

Whilst lying in wait, at any time before your next Turn, you may take the Full Auto Burst Action to fire at any targets within your kill zone (see **Full Auto Burst** on **[page 190](#page-190-0)**). Additionally, when you use your reserved Full Auto Burst, characters within the kill zone must make a Hard (–20) Pinning Test (see **Pinning** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**). If this Action occurs at the same time as another character's, the character with the higher Agility Bonus acts first. If both characters have the same Agility Bonus, you must make an Opposed Agility Test to see who acts first.

You may continue Overwatch for up to your Willpower Bonus in hours. After this time you must rest and refresh yourself for 1d10×10 minutes. Once you have used your Full Auto Burst Action, Overwatch ends. You may opt to end Overwatch during your Turn, even if you have not used your reserved shot.

If you take any other Action or Reaction whilst reserving your shot in this manner, Overwatch immediately ends, whether you have used your reserved shot or not. Note that this does not include Free Actions, such as speech.

#### **Semi-Auto Burst (Full Action)**

You hurl a burst of semi-automatic fire at your opponents. You must be using a weapon capable of semi-automatic fire to take this Action (see **Rate of Fire** on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**).

Your increased volume of fire grants a +10 modifier to your Ballistic Skill Test. If the ranged attack is successful, a hit is scored as normal. Furthermore, every two degrees of success scores an extra hit. The number of extra hits you can score in this manner may not exceed the semi-automatic rate of fire for your weapon. Your extra hits can be either allocated to the original target or to any other target within two metres (provided the new target would not have been harder to hit). See **Table 7-6: Multiple Hits, [page 190](#page-190-0)** to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Alternatively, as an optional rule, you may roll dice to determine the location of each additional hit, though doing so will slow the game down.

A result of 94–00 on your Ballistic Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed (see **Weapon Jams** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

If you have a pistol in either hand you may fire them both (see **Two-Weapon Fighting** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)**).

### **Standard Attack (Half Action)**

You can make one melee or ranged attack by Testing Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill. Certain weapons require Talents to use them effectively (see **Chapter IV: Talents**). You can still make attacks with these weapons if you lack the proper Talents, but you do so with a –20 penalty to your Weapon Skill for melee weapons or Ballistic Skill for ranged weapons.

### **Stun (Full Action)**

When unarmed or armed with a melee weapon, you can strike to Stun rather than attempt to land a killing blow. Whilst any character may attempt this Action, only characters with the Takedown talent stand a good chance of succeeding. Striking to Stun is resolved in a similar way to making a Standard Attack. Test Weapon Skill. If you don't have Takedown, take a –20 penalty to the Test. On a success, roll 1d10 and add your Strength Bonus. Your opponent rolls 1d10 and adds his Toughness Bonus +1 per armor Point protecting his head. If your roll is equal to or higher, your opponent is Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to the difference between the rolls and gains one level of Fatigue.

#### **Suppressing Fire (Full Action)**

You unleash a devastating hail of firepower to force your opponents into cover. You must be using a weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this Action (see **Rate of Fire**  on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**).

Pick an area to suppress. The size of this area, known as your kill zone, extends 45 degrees out from the direction you are facing up to half the range of the weapon. It is often easier to say you are covering a specific area such as a corridor, doorway or section of treeline. If there is any doubt, the GM has final say on whether a target is in your kill zone or not. Targets within this area must make a Hard (–20) Pinning Test (see **Pinning** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

Additionally, you must make a Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill Test to see if your wild spray of fire has hit anyone, friend or foe, within the kill zone. If the ranged attack is successful, the GM assigns the hit to a random target within the kill zone. Furthermore, every two degrees of success scores an extra hit against another random victim. Use of the Suppressing Fire Action does not affect the defensive benefits of armor or cover. The number of hits scored may not exceed the fully automatic rate of fire for your weapon. See **Table 7-6: Multiple Hits, [page 190](#page-190-0)** to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Alternatively, as an optional rule, you may roll dice to determine the location of each additional hit, though doing so will slow the game down.

A result of 94 to 00 on your Ballistics Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed (see **Weapon Jams** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

# **Combat Abstractions**

Combat in Dark Heresy is fast and furious, designed so your games don't become bogged down with minutia. As such, the rules take certain licences with reality and assumptions must be made about what is really going on during a combat. Generally speaking, when two characters are engaged, they are exchanging attacks, Parries, Dodges, Feints and a number of other manoeuvres, all of which are rolled into the Standard Attack. Therefore, a Test against Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill assumes that the defender is attempting to defend himself to some degree—hence a typical Attack Test is Challenging (+0). A failed Test means that the defender was too difficult to hit effectively, whilst a successful Test means that the attacker was able to strike a telling blow. Where Dodge and Parry come into play, they represent your last line of defence against an attacker, giving you one more chance to avoid a bullet or the swing of a chainsword.

# **Move Actions**

Move Actions let you manoeuvre on the battlefield.

# **Disengage (Full Action)**

You break off from melee combat and may move up to your Half Move rate. Opponents whom you were engaged with do not gain the customary free attacks. See **Fleeing sidebar** for more details.

# **Fleeing**

Sometimes it is just best to get away from your opponent by any means you can. In combat, you may voluntarily flee from an opponent or be forced to flee because of Fear, a Psychic Power or some other effect. When fleeing under your own control, you can take any of the following actions: Disengage, Move or Run. When fleeing against your will, you must take the Run action. Under most circumstances (except for Disengaging), you're turning your back on your opponent and leaving yourself open for an attack. If you are trying to move away from one or more melee opponents without using the Disengage Action, each opponent gets a free attack against you as you move away. This is an extra attack and is made in addition to any other attacks they make during their Turn.

# **Jump/Leap (Full Action)**

You can Jump up or down, or Leap across something. For **Jumping and Leaping**, see **[page 214](#page-214-0)**.

# **Manoeuvre (Half Action)**

By using superior footwork and aggression, you can force your opponent to move one metre in a direction of your choosing by making an Opposed Weapon Skill Test. If desired, you can advance one metre as well. The opponent cannot be forced into another character or some other obstacle (wall, barrel, and so on).

# **Move (Half or Full Action)**

You can make a short move. If you spend a Half Action to move, you may move up to that described on **Table 7-28: Movement in Metres/Round** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)**. If you use a Full Action, you may move twice this value. Whenever you end your movement adjacent to an adversary, you are said to be engaged with that opponent.

# **Run (Full Action)**

You run at full speed (see **Table 7-28: Movement in Metres/ Round** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)** for distances). This makes you harder to hit with missile weapons, but easy prey for melee attacks because you are not actively defending. Until your next Turn, ranged attacks made against you take a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests, but melee attacks gain a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests.

# **Stand/Mount (Half Action)**

You can get up if currently on the ground, or mount a riding beast or a vehicle.

**Tactical Advance (Full Action)**

You can move up to your Full Move rate provided that you move from a position of cover and end your movement in a position of cover. For the duration of your move, you are considered to benefit from cover, even though you are moving in the open for a brief time.

# **Miscellaneous Actions**

Miscellaneous Actions encompass everything else you might wish to do in combat.

# **Aim (Half or Full Action)**

You may take extra time to set up a melee or ranged attack to increase the chance to hit. If you spend a Half Action to aim, your next attack is made at a +10 to your Weapon Skill (for melee attacks) or Ballistic Skill (for ranged attacks). If you spend a Full Action Aiming, the bonus increases to +20. The attack must follow immediately otherwise the benefits of Aiming are lost.

# **Delay (Half Action)**

You watch and wait for an opportunity. When you use the delay Action, your Turn ends immediately, but you reserve a Half Action for later use. Any time before your next Turn, you can take your reserved Half Action. If you try to do something at the same time as another character that used a delay Action, you must make an Opposed Agility Test to see who acts first. If the prepared Action is not taken before your next Turn, it is lost. **Dodge**

Dodge is a Basic Skill, so anyone may attempt it even without training. Once a hit is scored, but before Damage is rolled, you can try to Dodge if you were aware of the attack. This is simply a Dodge Test. If the Dodge Test succeeds, you get out of the way at the last minute and the attack is considered to have missed (and thus there is no Damage roll). If you fail the Test, the attack connects and your opponent may roll for Damage as usual. You may Dodge both melee and ranged attacks.

# **Dodging Auto-Fire and Area Effect Attacks**

# **Example**

*It seems that the barman has taken exception to Drake's treatment of his paying customers and on his Initiative, starts combat by charging the Guardsman with a shock maul. The barman makes a Weapon Skill Test and hits. Drake can Test Dodge to get out of the way. He rolls the dice and compares the result to his Agility. He succeeds and manages to duck beneath the arc of the shock maul.*

Some attacks are more difficult to Dodge either because they cover a large area, like a grenade or flamer, or because they throw out large amounts of rounds, like a weapon fired on Full or Semi-Automatic Bursts.

When Dodging an area effect weapon, a successful Dodge Test will move the character to the edge of the area of effect, as long as it is no further away than their Agility Bonus in metres. If they would need to move further than this to avoid the attack then the Dodge Test automatically fails.

When Dodging Full or Semi-Automatic fire, each degree of success negates an additional hit. **Focus Power (Varies)**

# **Example**

*Father Horst is surprised by a mutant trooper with an autogun sneaking into the far end of his chapel-trench. The mutant has the drop on Father Horst, and so gets a Full Turn to act before Father Horst can do anything.*

*The debased-looking trooper uses his Turn to spray a Full Auto Burst (a Full Action) at Father Horst. The mutant gains +20 to his Ballistic Skill of 30 because of the sheer number of slugs his autogun is hurling. The mutant scores a 19 on his Test—a hit! As he has three degrees of success (50–19=31) the trooper has managed to score one additional hit.*

*Being a sensible soul, Father Horst decides use his Reaction to try and Dodge the Full Auto Burst. Father Horst Tests against his Agility of 40, and scores a 17. As this grants two degrees of success (40–17=23) Father Horst can escape two of the mutant's hits. Somehow, Father Horst has avoided all Damage—a miracle!*

This Action is used to manifest your Psychic Powers in combat. How long the Focus Power Action takes is dependant on the power being manifested. When you take this Action you roll a number of dice and add a bonus dependant on your Psy Rating. Then compare the total to the Psychic Threshold (PT). If this number equals or exceeds the PT, the power takes effect. Otherwise, it has failed and you may try again next Turn. For more information on Psychic Powers, see **Chapter VI: Psychic Powers**.

### **Parry**

You can attempt to Parry a successful attack if you are wielding a drawn melee weapon (see **Chapter V: armory**) and are aware of the attack. To Parry, Test Weapon Skill. If you succeed, you beat back the attack and it is considered to have missed (thus, there's no Damage roll). If you fail the Test, the attack connects and your opponent may roll for Damage as usual. Parrying requires no special Skill or Talent to attempt.

You may only use Parry to negate melee attacks.

## **Ready (Half Action)**

You can draw a weapon or retrieve an object stowed in a pouch or pocket. You can also put an item away that you are currently holding. So, you could holster a pistol and unsheathe a knife as one Half Action. You can also use this Action to do such things as apply a medi-patch, inject stimm or some other kind of drug, or coat a weapon with the contents of a vial of poison, for example. You may use the Ready Action twice in one Turn if you are preparing two different items.

## **Reload (Varies)**

You can reload a missile weapon. See **Chapter V: armory** for the time it takes to reload different missile weapons. Reload can be an Extended Action.

### **Use a Skill (Varies)**

You may use a Skill. This usually involves making a Skill Test. This can be an Extended Action, depending on the Skill and the circumstances.

# **Example**

*Vos is still battling the ill-tempered Grox. He has scored an Initiative of 7 while the Grox has an Initiative of 4, meaning Vos goes first. In his turn he spends a Half Action to Aim with his chain axe and then his remaining Half Action to attack. Unfortunately, Vos misses, despite the bonus for Aiming.* 

*It is now the Grox's Turn. Angered by the large hairy creature trying to kill it, the Grox uses a Full Action to make an All-Out Attack, though fortunately for Vos it also misses. As a Free Action the Grox lets out a whining bray calling for help from the herd. Since there are no more combatants, the Round ends.*

*As the new Round begins, a Bull-Grox appears from the forest in answer to its fellow's cry for aid. The GM rolls Initiative for the new combatant and determines that the Bull-Grox can act before Vos. The Bull-Grox Charges (a Full Action) and hits the feral warrior inflicting a nasty wound. Now it is Vos' Turn again. Wisely, he decides that two Grox is a Grox too many and beats a hasty retreat using a Disengage Action.*

If a player wants to do something not covered by the Actions described here, the GM should make a judgement about how long something might take and what type of Action it would be. Generally, most Actions should be resolved with some sort of Test: Characteristic Test, Skill Test or Opposed Test. Keep in mind that a Round is only a few seconds long, which is a very limited amount of time to accomplish a task.

# **The Tactical Map**

The Dark Heresy rules are written so you can use a tactical map and 28mm miniatures whilst playing out combat. This approach adds a visual element to the game and allows you to instantly understand the relative positions of all the combatants. You can find maps that are blank and can be written on with wet-erase pens. These allow you to sketch out the terrain and other important features on the map before combat begins. Wet-erase maps also make it easy to track the duration of Psychic Powers, reload times, and the like since you can scribble notes on the map. A tactical map is overlaid with a grid of one-inch squares to make measuring distances easier. In Dark Heresy, these squares represent a distance of one metre.

To make fullest use of the tactical map, you'll need miniatures. You'll want one for each PC, and the GM should try to collect a fair number of the most common foes (gangers, cultists, mutants and so on). If you don't have any miniatures, there are all sorts of things you can substitute, like counters, coins, or stones. Humans, mutants and other similarly sized creatures occupy a single square on the map. Larger creatures can take up 2, 4, or even more squares.

If you don't like tactical maps, but still want to use miniatures, the rules can easily accommodate this. Simply use a tape measure and each inch of distance equals one metre. This makes movement more flexible and has the advantage of allowing the easy use of three-dimensional terrain.

Some gamers don't like to use miniatures at all, preferring to imagine all the action. This is okay too. This method requires the GM to keep a snapshot of the action and the relative positions of all the combatants in his head, but it also allows for greater narrative freedom in describing encounters.

# **Other Actions** **THE ATTACK**

The most common Action in combat is the attack—you are fighting, after all. Whether armed with a melee or ranged weapon, the process is the same. Follow these steps to resolve attacks in combat.

# **Step One: Test**

To make a melee attack with a hand-held weapon, you must be engaged with your target. Test Weapon Skill. When making a ranged attack, you Test Ballistic Skill. Both of these are like any other Tests. If you roll equal to or below your Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill, you hit your opponent.

# **Step Two: Determine Hit Location**

On a successful hit, you next need to determine where the hit landed. Using the Test result, reverse the order of the dice, (e.g. a roll of 32 becomes 23, 19 becomes 91, and so on) and compare this number to **Table 7-7: Hit Locations**. Note that certain creatures with different body shapes, or mounted opponents, may use different hit location tables.

| Table 7-7: Hit Locations |           |  |  |
|--------------------------|-----------|--|--|
| Roll                     | Location  |  |  |
| 01–10                    | Head      |  |  |
| 11–20                    | Right Arm |  |  |
| 21–30                    | Left Arm  |  |  |
| 31–70                    | Body      |  |  |
| 71–85                    | Right Leg |  |  |
| 86–00                    | Left Leg  |  |  |

# **Example**

*Pieter (BS35) shoots at the oncoming ganger, rolling 13—a hit! Reversing the number rolled gives 31, the ganger has been shot in the body.*

# **Step Three: Determine Damage**

Once you've determined the Hit Location, it is time to work out any Damage you have dealt. Each weapon has a Damage listing. This is usually a die roll, plus or minus a number. Roll the appropriate die, and add the Damage Bonus of the weapon. Finally, if you are using a melee weapon, add your Strength Bonus.

This is the Damage total. If you roll a "10" on any of your Damage dice, you have a chance of Righteous Fury! (see **sidebar**).

# **Step Four: Apply Damage**

From the Damage total, your opponent subtracts his Toughness Bonus and any armor Points that protect the location that is hit. If this reduces the Damage total to 0 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the attack. Any remaining Damage is recorded on his character sheet as Damage. Should this injury equal or exceed his Wounds, he notes any excess as Critical Damage and <span id="page-195-0"></span>the GM consults the appropriate table based on the weapon used and the amount of Critical Damage accumulated. See **Critical Damage** on **[page 201](#page-201-0)** for more information.

# **Example**

*Drake has a Ballistic Skill of 42 and uses his triplex-pattern lasgun to shoot a gambler foolish enough to accuse him of cheating. He rolls a 27. Since this is less than his Ballistic Skill, he has scored a hit. Next, he reverses the dice rolled to see where he hits, which is a 72—the Right Leg. Now he rolls Damage. He is using a lasgun, which does 1d10+3 Damage. He rolls 1d10 and gets an 8, for a total of 11 (8+3=11). The gambler has a Toughness Bonus of 3 and is wearing a concealed quilted vest. Since the armor does not cover the legs, the gambler can only use his Toughness Bonus to reduce the Damage. The gambler takes 8 Wounds (11–3=8), hopefully discouraging him from making any rash accusations in future.*

# **Righteous Fury!**

Normally, when you hit with an attack, the resulting Damage includes rolling one or more d10s. When you roll a 10 on any die (this includes a result of 10 when using a d5—even though the number is halved), it may indicate that the eye of the Emperor is upon you. This calls for a second attack roll, Testing Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill as if you were making another attack. If this second Test is successful, the spirit of the Emperor is within you, aiding your attack and guiding your aim. You can roll an additional 1d10 and add the result to the Damage total.

Should the result of this die also be a 10, the Emperor has indeed smiled upon you. You may immediately roll a third 1d10 and add that to the Damage total as well. This process continues until you roll a number other than 10.

*Not content to let things lie, the gambler has charged Drake with a knife. The Veteran Guardsman responds by smashing him across the face with the butt of his lasgun. Drake rolls for Damage, and scores a 10! He has a chance of dealing extra Damage. He makes a second attack roll and succeeds again. He rolls another d10 and once again gets a 10. Rather than make another Weapon Skill Test, Drake just rolls another d10. This time it comes up 8. The Damage total for this attack is 4 (Drake's SB) + 10 +10 + 8, for a total of 32 Damage. It doesn't look like the gambler will be getting up anytime soon.*

*Normally NPCs do not benefit from the Righteous Fury rule, however, at the GM's discretion particularly important or powerful NPCs might take advantage of this rule.*

# **Dealing Damage**

Any attack, Psychic Power or hazard that deals Damage generally indicates the amount of Damage with a die type, and Damage modifier. For example, a lasgun's Damage is 1d10+3. This means that in order to discover the injury caused by the weapon, you roll one d10 and add 3 to the result. This gives your Damage total. In some cases, the modifier will subtract from the Damage you have rolled.

#### **When dealing Damage with a melee attack, your Strength Bonus also comes into play.**

To calculate Damage done with a hand-to-hand weapon, such as a chainsword, hammer or spear, you calculate the Damage as normal and then add your Strength Bonus.

# **Example**

*Father Horst is fighting in a mud-filled trench on a Throneforsaken battlefield. A crazed Chaos worshipper moves in to attack Horst, and misses. Hefting his blessed hammer, Horst swings at the degenerate scum. Success! His attack hits. The Damage of Horst's hammer is 1d10+1. Horst rolls a 6 on his Damage die, and then adds the Damage modifier of 1. Finally, Horst adds his Strength Bonus of 2 (his Strength is 29). In total, Horst has dealt 9 points of Damage (6+1+2=9).*

Whether your Damage total can be reduced depends on the nature of the attack, but Damage is typically reduced by the target's Toughness Bonus and armor Points that protect the location struck.

# **Ranged Attacks**

Ranged attacks—lasguns, scatterguns, thrown weapons, etc.—are resolved in the same way as melee attacks, except that you Test Ballistic Skill instead of Weapon Skill. In addition, there are a few extra considerations that apply to these attacks.

- Ranged attacks cannot be Parried, unless you have a special Talent.
- You do not add your Strength Bonus to the Damage of ranged attacks.
- You cannot make ranged attacks whilst engaged in melee, unless you are armed with a ranged weapon that is classed as a pistol.
- You must be able to see the target. You may still attack targets that are partly visible, such as those standing behind a tree or behind other targets, but they will often be in cover. If you are aware of an opponent that is completely concealed from you by a barrier, you can attempt the shot, but at a –30 penalty and the shot must deal enough Damage to breach the barrier. When shooting at unseen targets you also gain no bonuses for range.

### **Shooting into Melee**

There will be times when a target is already engaged with another enemy. Ballistic Skill Tests against these opponents are harder than normal. You can still make a ranged attack at an opponent engaged in melee, but you take a –20 penalty to the Test.

**Optional Rule:** GMs keen on reinforcing the merciless nature of the 41st Millennium may rule that if you would have hit the target were it not for the penalty, you instead hit the target's opponent. The GM might also rule that anyone shooting into melee with a semi-automatic or full automatic weapon must allocate at least one of their hits against the target's opponent.

### **Missing**

Sometimes, when flinging a thrown weapon, it's important to know where the weapon lands should you fail on your Ballistic Skill Test. On a failed roll, the GM rolls 1d10 and consults the following **Scatter Diagram**. Roll 1d5 to determine the number of metres the weapon travels in the indicated direction.

### **Pinning**

Being shot at is a terrifying experience at the best of times and even the most inexperienced Acolytes know to keep their heads down when the bullets and bolt shells start flying. Pinning represents a character's survival instincts telling him to stay in cover. While he may want to charge headlong into a storm of bullets, he first needs to steel his nerves. When a character is on the receiving end of suppressive fire, even if the shot struck a Hit Location that is behind cover or the character suffers no Damage, he must make a Hard (–20 ) Pinning Test. This is a Willpower Test. On a success, the character may act normally. On a failure, the character becomes Pinned.

#### **Being Pinned**

A Pinned character may only take Half Actions. Additionally, he must take a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests if he fires, snapping off shots while being mindful of their own safety. If a Pinned character is in cover relative to the attacker that Pinned them, he may not leave it except to retreat (provided that he can remain in cover while doing so). If he is not in cover when Pinned he must use his next Turn to reach cover. If there is no cover nearby, he must move away from the attacker that Pinned him. A character can Test Willpower at the end of his Turn to escape Pinning, in which case he may act as normal in his next Turn. This Test is Easy (+30) if the character is no longer under fire (i.e. no one tried to shoot him since his last Turn). A character engaged in close combat automatically escapes Pinning. There are some special Talents, Skills and Psychic Powers that can also free a character from the effects of Pinning—as well as such things as combat drugs and terrifying commissars.

# **Example**

*Vos is being pursued by the Grox. Fortunately for him he has found the burnt-out remains of an Arbites APC to shelter in, complete with intact pintle-mounted heavy stubber. Aiming the powerful machine gun in the direction of the Grox, Vos decides that rather than firing a full auto burst, he will lay down Suppressive Fire. He chooses a narrow gully nearby as his kill zone, as this is where the Grox are emerging from.* 

*Each of the three Grox in the kill zone must make a Hard (–20) Pinning Test to ignore the terrifying effects of Vos' Suppressing Fire. Each fails, meaning that the Grox will be forced to use their Turn to fall back into cover. Vos makes a Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill Test to see if his volley has struck any of the Grox. He scores a 55, which means that none of his bullets hit.*

*On the Grox's turn, each flees into the cover of the gully. Each then Tests Willpower to see if they feel brave enough to risk the hail of bullets once more. Two succeed and one fails.*

 *Seeing that the heavy stubber's ammo belt is empty, Vos uses his turn to run away as fast as possible.* 

*The two Grox who managed to escape Pinning are free to use their turn to chase Vos. The Grox which failed to escape Pinning, meanwhile, is forced to remain in cover, emptying its bowels and snorting nervously to itself. As it is no longer under fire from the heavy stubber, at the end of its turn the cowardly Grox makes an Easy (+30) Willpower Test to escape Pinning. The Grox succeeds, meaning that on its subsequent Turn, it may break from cover and rejoin the chase.*

## **Weapon Jams**

Such is the capricious whim of the 41st Millennium that many of the ranged weapons that an Acolyte uses will have an unfortunate tendency to malfunction, either through extreme age, maltreatment of their machine spirit, or just plain poor design. To represent these unfortunate occurrences, an unmodified result of 96 to 00, in addition to being an automatic miss, also indicates the weapon has jammed. A Jammed weapon cannot be fired until it is cleared. Clearing a Jam is a Full Action which requires a Ballistic Skill Test. If the Test is successful then the Jam has been cleared, though the weapon needs to be reloaded and any ammo in it is lost. If the Test is failed the weapon is still Jammed, though the character can attempt to clear it again next Round.

**Note:** Some weapons, such as plasma guns, grenades and missiles, are particularly dangerous to use. For these weapons refer to their descriptions and Weapon Special Qualities (see **Chapter V: armory**). Semi-automatic and fully automatic fire also increases the likelihood of Jamming. This is described within the Semi-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst and Suppressing Fire Actions.

### **Two-Weapon Fighting**

Many warriors fight with a weapon in either hand (this includes shields). There are advantages and disadvantages to this style of fighting. While it offers some improved opportunities to make attacks, it reduces the chances of successfully striking a target. The following apply when you are fighting with two weapons:

- You may use any close combat weapons or ranged weapons that you may reasonably use in one hand when fighting with two weapons.
- You may use either hand to make an attack. Attacks made using your secondary hand take a –20 penalty.
- If you have the Two-Weapon Wielder talent, you may spend a Full Action to attack with both weapons, but each takes a –20 penalty to the Test. If you have the Ambidextrous talent, this penalty drops to –10.
- If you're wielding a melee weapon as one of your two weapons you may make a Parry once each Round as a Reaction as normal with this weapon, though you still may not Parry more than once in a Round. This Weapon Skill Test is not an attack, and therefore it does suffer the standard penalty for attacks made using your secondary hand.
- If armed with a melee weapon in one hand and a pistol in the other, you may, with the Two-Weapon Wielder talent use both in close combat. Resolve each attack separately by Testing Weapon Skill for the melee weapon and Ballistic Skill for the pistol. Using both attacks simultaneously is a Full Action and is subject to the usual penalties.
- When firing a ranged weapon with each hand, you may fire each weapon on a different mode, for example, one on full automatic and one on semi-automatic. When firing a full automatic weapon in each hand, you may only lay down one area of suppressive fire.
- You may fire your weapons at different targets, though they must be within 10 metres of each other.

# **Unarmed Combat**

Not every fight in Dark Heresy requires bolters and power swords. Some conflicts can be settled the oldfashioned way with fists (not to mention feet and, if you're a dirty scummer, teeth). A successful Weapon Skill Test made with an unarmed attack deals 1d5–3 Impact Damage, plus the character's Strength Bonus. armor Points count as double against the attack. In addition, a successful hit also causes one level of Fatigue.

During unarmed combat, if you roll a 10 on a die for Damage the rules for Righteous Fury apply (see **[page 195](#page-195-0)**) with 10s counting as 5s in terms of Damage caused.

# **Grappling**

Instead of inflicting Damage with an unarmed attack, you can attempt to Grapple and immobilise your opponent. You can attempt a Grapple with either a Charge or a Standard Attack. Resolve a Grapple by following these steps.

### **Step One: Make the Attack**

Make an unarmed attack by Testing Weapon Skill as normal.

### **Step Two: Avoid the Attack**

If you succeed, your opponent may use their Reaction to make an Agility Test. If this Test fails, or they have already used their Reaction this Round, the opponent is Grappled. If he succeeds, the Grapple attempt fails.

### **Step Three: Grapple!**

While two or more characters are Grappling, the following effects apply.

- Participants in a Grapple may not Dodge or Parry.
- Other attackers gain a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests made to hit a Grappling target.
- Grappled characters may only take the Grapple Action (see **Grapple Action** on **[page 190](#page-190-0)**).
- As a Free Action, you can voluntarily end the Grapple that you initiated on your Turn.

# **Combining Difficulties**

There will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more difficult than normal. For example, while in a shadowy hanger bay, trying to shoot at an opponent at long range is harder that shooting at the same opponent if the hanger was brightly lit. To combine multiple factors, use the following guidelines:

- •If the situationwould apply two or more penalties,simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of –60. For example, fog and Aiming for a specific body part each make Ballistic Skill Tests –20 (Hard). When combined, the test would be –40.
- If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new Difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a Very Hard (–30) Test. But attacking an opponent who is Stunned requires a Routine (+20) Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be Difficult (–10) since –30 plus +20 equals –10.
- If the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60. Two characters that attack the same Stunned opponent would ordinarily gain a +10 bonus for ganging up and a +20 bonus for attacking a Stunned target. Thus the need to make Easy (+30) Weapon Skill Tests to hit their opponent.

When adjudicating Difficulty, common sense should prevail. No matter what limit there is on Test penalties, some shots are simply impossible.

# **Combat Circumstances**

The chances of hitting in combat can be modified in a similar manner to Skill Tests. These combat circumstances can be used to reflect the effects of terrain, the weather, tactical situations and a variety of other factors. Characters should make as much use of beneficial circumstances as possible. A good plan, suitable equipment or skilful use of tactics can often make the difference between life and death for an Acolyte. The following circumstances are some of the most common ones encountered in combat. For situations not covered here, use these as a guide. Remember, the GM has the final say about the Difficulty of any particular Test.

# **Called Shots**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit a specific location are Hard (–20). Note you cannot make Called Shots when firing a weapon on semi-automatic or full automatic fire.

## **Darkness**

Weapon Skill Tests made in darkness are regarded as Hard (–20), while Ballistic Skill Tests are regarded as Very Hard (–30).

# **Difficult Terrain**

Weapon Skill and Dodge Tests made whilst standing in difficult terrain such as mud are Difficult (–10). Tests made whilst standing in arduous terrain such as deep snow or upon ice are Very Hard (–30).

# **Extreme Range**

Targets that are at a distance of three times the range of a character's weapon, are at Extreme range. Rolls to hit these targets with a ranged weapon are Very Hard (–30).

# **Fatigued**

When a character is Fatigued all their Tests, including any Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests, suffer a –10 penalty.

# **Firing a Weapon on Semi-Automatic**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit targets when firing a weapon on Semi-Automatic are Ordinary (+10).

## **Firing a Weapon on Full Automatic**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit targets when firing a weapon on Full Automatic are Routine (+20).

## **Fog, Mist or Shadow**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets concealed by fog, mist or shadow are Hard (–20).

## **Ganging Up**

You have an advantage when you and your allies engage the same foe in melee combat. If you outnumber your opponent two to one, your Weapon Skill Tests are Ordinary (+10). If you outnumber your opponent by three to one or more, your Weapon Skill Tests are Routine (+20).

## **Helpless Targets**

Weapon Skill Tests made to hit a sleeping, unconscious or otherwise helpless target automatically succeed. When rolling Damage against such a target roll two dice and add the results. If either die rolled comes up as a 10, you have a chance at Righteous Fury. If both dice come up as 10, you automatically gain Righteous Fury, and roll Damage again.

# **Higher Ground**

Characters standing on higher ground—such as standing on a table, fighting from the top of a mound of dead comrades, on top of a hill, and so on—have a combat advantage. Weapon Skill Tests made by these characters are Ordinary (+10).

# **Long Range**

Targets that are at a distance of more than double the range of a character's weapon, are at long range. Rolls to hit these targets with a ranged weapon are Difficult (–10).

# **Point Blank**

Rolls to hit a target within three metres with a ranged weapon are Easy (+30). Note that this bonus does not apply when shooting targets that are in close combat with the character.

# **Prone**

Targets that have been Knocked Down are easier to hit and they find it harder to hit other foes. Weapon Skill Tests made to attack Prone targets are Ordinary (+10). Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made by Prone targets are Difficult (–10). Dodge Tests made whilst Prone are Hard (–20).

# **Off Hand Attacks**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack foes whilst you're using a weapon in your off hand are considered Hard (–20).

# **Short Range**

Targets that are at a distance of less than half the Range of a character's weapon are at Short range. Rolls to hit these targets with a ranged weapon are Ordinary (+10).

# **Shooting into Melee Combat**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit a target in melee combat with an opponent are Hard (–20).

# **Size**

Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a Land Raider than a grav-bike for instance. Use **Table 7-9: Size Modifiers** for working out bonuses and penalties based on size.

# **Stunned Targets**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack Stunned targets are Routine (+20).

| Table 7-9:                           | Size Modifiers |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Size                                 | Modifier       |
| Minuscule (Door handle, knife)       | –30            |
| Puny (Rat, servo-skull)              | –20            |
| Scrawny (Child, ash slug)            | –10            |
| Average (Human, mutant)              | 0              |
| Hulking (Grox, combat servitor)      | +10            |
| Enormous (Silt spider, Land speeder) | +20            |
| Massive (Battle tank, scar wyrm)     | +30            |

# **Unaware Targets**

Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack unaware targets (i.e. Surprised targets), are Easy (+30).

# **Unarmed**

When making an unarmed attack against an armed opponent, your Weapon Skill Test is Hard (–20).

# **Weather and Unnatural Conditions**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack whilst enduring harsh weather or unnatural conditions, such as standing in heavy rain, an ash storm or knee-deep in waves of fungus are considered Hard (-20).

# **Cover**

Cover is a vital part of surviving a firefight and a good Acolyte knows that you go for your cover first and then draw your gun. There are no penalties to Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets standing partly behind cover. However, there is a chance that the shot may hit the cover rather than the target. It is up to the player to decide which parts of his body he is exposing when behind cover. Unless the Acolyte is attempting a rather crude form of psychological warfare, as a rule of thumb, a character firing around or over cover will have his body and legs concealed. If the shot would hit a body location that is concealed behind cover, work out the Damage against the armor Points of the cover instead, with any excess being applied to the target as normal (see **Table 7-10: Cover Types** for a guide to the armor Points of different kinds of cover).

# **Damaging Cover**

Cover is not invulnerable. Attacks can Damage or destroy the protection afforded by cover. Each successful hit against cover that deals Damage in excess of the armor Points it provides will reduce the cover's armor Points by 1. For example, a bolter shot that penetrates a light wooden door would reduce the door's AP to 3.

| Table 7-10:                          | Cover Types |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Cover Type                           | AP          |
| Light Wood, armor-glas, Light Metal  | 4           |
| Heavy Wood, Flakboard, Sandbags, Ice | 8           |
| Rockcrete, Thick Iron, Stone         | 16          |
| Plasteel, Armaplas                   | 32          |

# Injury

*"Better crippled in body than corrupt in mind."* — *Lexiconum Moralis*.

A As a consequence of fighting, characters take Damage. A combatant can take Damage up to an amount equal to his Wounds. When the Damage equals the character's Wounds, he is a bloodied mess barely clinging to consciousness. Further blows become Critical Damage, resulting in such things as permanent disability, the loss of limbs and of course, death.

# Fatigue 

Not all Damage is lethal in Dark Heresy. Exhaustion, combat trauma or swapping licks with bare fists can all leave a character battered, but more or less intact. Fatigue measures the amount of non-lethal Damage a character can take over the course of game play. Characters gain Fatigue from certain types of attacks, Grappling, forced marching and other Actions which push them beyond safe limits. A character can take a number of levels of Fatigue equal to his Toughness Bonus, so a character with a four Toughness Bonus can take four levels of Fatigue. Should a character take a number of levels of Fatigue in excess of his Toughness Bonus, he collapses, unconscious for 10–TB minutes.

Characters suffering from Fatigue are at a –10 penalty to all Tests.

# **Example**

*Drake has been on a forced march for several hours, causing him to take two levels of Fatigue. Finally, he arrives at the settlement of Stern Hope, and makes his way to the local dive for a cold flagon of spitbrew. Whilst quaffing the (slightly chunky) ale, he manages to get on the wrong side of Slippery Zim, a local gangster. Zim takes a swing at him with a bottle. Drake is forced to Dodge out of the way. He makes a Dodge Skill Test, and rolls 30. As Drake's Agility is 34, this would normally be a success. However, as Drake is Fatigued he would need to roll 24 or less to successfully Dodge (34–10 = 24). Too tired to leap out of the way properly, Drake gets the bottle smashed into his skull.*

## **Removing Fatigue**

If left alone, Fatigue goes away in time. Each hour of rest which includes no combat, no Psychic Powers and nothing strenuous, removes one level of Fatigue. Eight consecutive hours of rest remove all levels of Fatigue.

# Becoming Stunned

In addition to Wound loss and other sorts of Damage, characters may also become Stunned. A character can become Stunned due to the effects of some Psychic Powers, Critical Hits, or the Takedown talent. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests to hit Stunned characters are considered Routine (+20). In addition, Stunned characters cannot take Actions of any kind, even free ones like Dodge.

# Characteristic Damage

Some Psychic Powers, poisons, diseases and other hazards circumvent your Wounds and deal Damage directly to your Characteristic. Characteristic loss cannot reduce a Characteristic below 0. Unless otherwise specified, Characteristic Damage is never permanent and you recover lost points at a rate of one each hour. Remember, penalties to Characteristics as well as Characteristic Damage may also affect the Characteristic's bonus. Should the Damage or penalty reduce the tens digit of a Characteristic, the associated bonus also drops by 1.

Consult the following entries for information on what happens if a Characteristic is reduced to 0. Remember when a Characteristic like Strength, Toughness or Agility is reduced, it will also reduce your corresponding Strength Bonus, Toughness Bonus or Agility Bonus.

- **Weapon Skill:** You may not take Tests based on this Characteristic.
- **Ballistic Skill:** You may not take Tests based on this Characteristic.
- **Strength:** You collapse into unconsciousness.

**Toughness:** You die.

- **Agility:** You are paralysed and helpless. Take no Actions.
- **Intelligence:** You slip into a dreamless coma, possibly drooling on yourself in an embarrassing way.
- **Perception:** You are bereft of your senses. Take a –30 penalty to all tests (except Toughness) until you recover.
- **Willpower:** You collapse into a nightmare filled sleep. When you awaken, gain 1 Insanity Point (see **Fear, Terror and Insanity** in **Chapter VIII: The Games Master**).
- **Fellowship:** You withdraw into a catatonic state. You may not speak or take Tests based on this Characteristic.

# **Damage Types**

All Damage is divided up into four types: Energy (lasers, fire, plasma), Explosive (grenades, bolt rounds, missiles), Impact (clubs, bullets, falling) and Rending (swords, chain weapons, claws). What kind of Damage a weapon or effect deals will be noted in its description. Damage types only apply to Critical Hits and serve to determine which Critical Effects table you use when inflicting Critical Hits.

**If it is not specified what type of Damage an attack deals, count it as Impact. If it does not specify what location an attack hits, count it as the Body.**

# **CRITICAL DAMAGE**

Any Damage taken in excess of a character's Wounds counts as Critical Damage. When this occurs, immediately consult the table that corresponds with the location (arm, body, etc.) and the type of attack (Energy, Explosive, Impact or Rending). The Critical Damage total determines the severity of the injury to the location. Should the character survive, the Critical Damage still remains. If the same character takes Damage again, the Critical Damage is added to the existing Damage and the cumulative Damage total is used to determine the new Critical Effect.

# **Example**

*Mordechai takes a nasty hit from a ganger's axe, taking 10 points of Damage. Mordechai has only 10 Wounds, so he's probably in trouble. On the next Round, the filthy ganger hits him again, dealing another 3 points of Damage (after reducing the Damage total by Mordechai's TB and armor Points) to the head. These three points exceed Mordechai's Wounds, so they count as Critical Damage. The GM looks at the Critical Rending–Head table, looks at the third row and announces the result. Mordechai loses one eye, is Stunned, and takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The GM rolls for Fatigue, getting a 3. Luckily, Mordechai's Toughness Bonus is 5, so he can take two more levels of Fatigue before falling unconscious.*

*On Mordechai's next Turn, he spends a Fate Point to recover from being Stunned, then attacks feebly, noting that he's at a –10 penalty for his Fatigue, and misses. The ganger, sensing the end is near, lashes out with his axe and hits Mordechai again, this time dealing 5 points of Damage (after TB and AP) to the body. Mordechai adds 5 Critical Damage to the 3 he's already accumulated for a total of 8. Looking at the Critical table, this time for the body, the GM reads the "8" result, "With a vile tearing noise, the skin on your chest comes away revealing a red ruin of muscle. You must make a Toughness Test or die. If you pass, you permanently lose 1d10 from your Toughness, take 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and now suffer Blood Loss." This could well be the end for poor Mordechai.*

# **Sudden Death Critical Hits**

Sometimes players just want to know if an opponent is dead or not and don't much care about the details. Where convenient (or if a situation demands it), the GM can speed along combat without adjudicating detailed Critical Hits. In some cases, grievous wounds have already been inflicted, so it's just a matter of finishing an enemy off. In these instances, use the Sudden Death method. Any Critical Damage results in the target's death, i.e. they will die when they take any Damage in excess of their Wounds. This rule is especially useful when dealing with minor foes, such as nameless gangers and cultists, though it should not be used for PCs or NPCs, who probably deserve better.

# **Permanent Effects**

Some Critical Effects are permanent. Should a character suffer more than one of these effects, it's probably time to start looking for some bionic replacements (see **Chapter V: armory, [page 153](#page-153-0)**) or retire the poor fellow and roll up a new one. Whenever a character suffers a permanent effect, they apply the following changes to their character.

# **Lost Hand**

You take a –20 penalty on all Skill and Characteristic Tests that rely on the use of two hands and you cannot wield twohanded weapons. A shield can be strapped to the injured arm, however. Should this be your primary hand, you take the customary -20 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack with weapons using your secondary hand. For every 100 xp you spend, you can reduce this penalty by 10.

If you lose both hands, you can either secure at least one replacement or get someone to sharpen your teeth.

# **Lost Arm**

As for a lost hand, but you cannot strap a shield to the arm since you don't have one. Losing both arms is just as bad, plus it's a bit difficult to reach those hard-to-clean spots. Once again, either look into replacement limbs or consider rolling up a new character.

# **Lost Eye or Blinded**

Losing one eye permanently reduces your Ballistic Skill by -10. In addition, you take a –20 penalty to all Skill and Characteristics Tests that rely on sight. Should you have the misfortune to lose both eyes, you gain the Blind trait (see **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists, [page](#page-329-0) [329](#page-329-0)**). You can of course continue to serve the Inquisition as you don't need your eyes to see the truth.

# **Lost Foot**

Reduce all your movement by half permanently (round up) and take a –20 penalty to Skill and Characteristic Tests that rely on mobility, such as the Dodge skill. Losing both feet makes it hard to walk. Perhaps one of your fellow Acolytes will carry you…

# **Lost Leg**

Treat this as a lost foot, but you cannot use the Dodge skill. Losing both legs makes you half the servant of the Emperor you were—a fact not lost on your enemies.

# **Deafened**

You cannot hear at all, or at least not well enough to communicate with others. Until you recover or have this disability repaired, you will automatically fail any Skill or Characteristic Test that relies on sound. Apart from also having trouble communicating with your fellow Acolytes, the GM is free to decide whenever being deaf will have an effect in the game.

| 1               | A grazing blow to the head frazzles the target's senses, imposing a –10 penalty to all Tests (except Toughness) for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 3               | The attack cooks off the target's ear, leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4               | The energy attack burns away all of the hairs on the target's head as well as leaving him reeling from the injury. The attack deals 2 levels of Fatigue and the target is blinded for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                            |
| 5               | A blast of energy envelopes the target's head, burning his face and hair, and causing him to scream like a stuck Grox.

| 6               | The attack cooks the target's face, melting his features and damaging his eyes. The target is blinded for the next 1d10 hours and permanently reduces his Fellowship characteristic by 1d10 points. The target also takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                             |
| 7               | In a gruesome display, the flesh is burned from the target's head, exposing charred bone and muscle underneath. The target is blinded permanently and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. Also, roll 1d10. This is the target's new Fellowship, unless their Fellowship is already 10 or less, in which case nobody really notices the difference. |
| 8               | The target's head is destroyed in a convocation of fiery death. He does not survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 9               | Superheated by the attack, the target's brain explodes, tearing apart his skull and sending flaming chunks of meat flying at those nearby. The target is no more.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 10+             | As above, except the target's entire body catches fire and runs off headless 2d10 metres in a random direction (use the Scatter Diagram on page 196). Anything flammable it passes, including characters, must make an Agility Test or catch fire (see Special Damage).                                                                      |

| 1               | A blast to the arm leaves it all numb and tingly. Tests made involving the arm are at –30 for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2               | The attack smashes the arm, sending currents of energy crackling down to the fingers and up to the shoulder. The arm is useless for 1d5 Rounds and the character takes 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                |
| 3               | The attack burns the target's arm leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and inflicts 2 levels of Fatigue. The arm is useless for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4               | The shock of the attack makes the target vomit. He is Stunned for 1 Round and takes 3 levels of Fatigue. The arm is useless for 1d10 Rounds.                                                                                                                                              |
| 5               | The arm suffers superficial burns inflicting no small amount of pain on the target. The target's WS and BS are halved (round down) for 1 Round and the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                |
| 6               | The attack wreathes the arm in flame, scorching clothing and armor, and temporarily fusing together the target's fingers. The target halves WS and BS for 1d10 Rounds, takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, and must successfully Test Toughness or lose the use of the hand permanently.         |
| 7               | With a terrible snapping sound, the heat of the attack boils the marrow in the target's arm, causing it to shatter. The target's arm is broken and until it is repaired the target counts as only having one arm. The target is Stunned for 1 Round and also takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. |
| 8               | Energy sears through the arm at the shoulder, causing the limb to be severed from the body. The target must take a Toughness Test or become Stunned for 1 Round. In addition the target takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is suffering from Blood Loss. The target now only has one arm.   |
| 9               | Fire consumes the target's arm, burning the flesh to a crisp right down to the bone. The target must make an immediate Toughness Test or die from shock. If he survives, however, the target takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is Stunned for 1 Round. The target now only has one arm.    |
| 10+             | The attack reduces the arm to a cloud of ash and sends the target crumbling to the ground where they immediately die from shock, clutching their smoking stump.                                                                                                                           |

The leg is utterly lost.                                                                                                                                              |
| 10+             | In a terrifying display of power, the leg immolates and fire consumes the target completely. The target dies in a matter of agonizing seconds                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 1               | The impact fills the target's head with a terrible ringing noise. The target must Test Toughness or take 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2               | The attack causes the target to see stars.

| 6               | The target's head is snapped back by the attack leaving him staggering around trying to control mind-numbing pain. The target is Stunned for 1d5 Rounds and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 7               | The attack slams into the target's head, fracturing his skull and opening a long tear in his scalp. The target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and halves all movement for 1d10 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 8               | Blood pours from the target's noise, mouth, ears and eyes as the attack pulverizes his brain. He does not survive the experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9               | The target's head bursts like an overripe fruit and sprays blood, bone and brains in all directions. Anyone within 4 metres of the target must make an Agility Test or suffer a –10 penalty to their WS and BS on their next Turn as gore gets in their eyes or on their visors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 10+             | As above, except that the attack was so powerful that it passes through the target and may hit another target nearby. If the hit was from a melee weapon, the attacker may immediately make another attack (with the same weapon) against any other target they can reach without moving. If the hit was from a ranged weapon they may immediately make another attack (with the same weapon) against any target standing directly behind the original target and still within range of their weapon. |

Table 7-20: Explosive Critical Effects – Arm **Critical Damage Effect** 1 The attack throws the limb backwards, painfully jerking it away from the body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue. 2 The attack sends a fracture through the limb. The target drops anything held in the hand and takes 2 levels of Fatigue. 3 The explosion takes 1d5 fingers from the target's hand. The target takes 3 levels of Fatigue and anything carried in the hand is destroyed. If this is an explosive, it goes off. Messy. 4 The blast causes the target to howl in agony. He takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, is Stunned for 1 Round, and the limb is useless until medical attention is received. 5 Fragments from the explosion tear into the target's hand, ripping away flesh and muscle alike. He must immediately Test Toughness or lose the hand. Even on a success, the hand is useless until medical attention is received. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. 6 The explosive attack shatters the bone and mangles the flesh turning the target's arm into a red ruin, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The target's arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm. In addition, the horrendous nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss. 7 In a violent hail of flesh, the arm is blown apart. The target must immediately make a Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 rounds, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and suffers Blood Loss. He now only has one arm. 8 The arm disintegrates under the force of the explosion taking a good portion of the shoulder and chest with it. The target is sent screaming to the ground, where he dies in a pool of his own blood and organs. 9 With a mighty bang the arm is blasted from the target's body, killing the target instantly in a rain of blood droplets. In addition, if the target was carrying a weapon with a power source in his hand (such as a power sword or chainsword) then it explodes, dealing 1d10+5 Damage to anyone within two metres. 10+ As above, except if the target is carrying any ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres (this is in addition to Damage caused by exploding power weapons noted above). If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on his person.

Table 7-21: Explosive Critical Effects – Body **Critical Damage Effect** 1 The target is blown backwards 1d5 metres and takes 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. He is Prone when he lands. 2 The target is blown backwards 1d10 metres, taking 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. If he strikes a solid object, he takes 1d5 additional levels of Fatigue. 3 The explosion destroys whatever armor protected the body. If the target wore none, the target is blown backwards 1d10 metres, as above but the target takes 2 levels of Fatigue for every metre travelled. 4 The explosion sends the target sprawling to the ground. He takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, is Stunned for 1 Round, and must spend a Full Action to regain his feet. 5 Concussion from the explosion knocks the target to the ground and tenderises his innards. The target falls down Stunned for 1 Round and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. 6 Chunks of the target's flesh are ripped free by the force of the attack leaving large, weeping wounds. The target is Stunned for 1 Round, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is now suffering Blood Loss. 7 The explosive force of the attack ruptures the target's flesh and scrambles his nervous system, knocking him to the ground. The target falls down, is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. In addition, he now suffers Blood Loss and can only take Half Actions for the next 1d10 hours as he tries to regain control of his body. 8 The target's chest explodes outward, disgorging a river of partially cooked organs onto the ground, killing him instantly. 9 Pieces of the target's body fly in all directions as he his torn into bloody gobbets by the attack. In addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on the target's person. 10+ As above, except anyone within 1d10 metres of the target is drenched in gore and must make an Agility Test or take a -10 penalty to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests for 1 Round as blood fouls their sight.

| 1               | A glancing blast sends the character backwards one metre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2               | The force of the explosion takes the target's feet out from under him. He lands Prone and takes 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3               | The concussion cracks the target's leg, leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and halving all movement for1d5 Rounds. The target takes 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4               | The explosion sends the target spinning through the air. The target travels 1d5 metres away from theexplosion and takes 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. It takes the target a Full Action to regain hisfeet and he halves all movement for 1d10 Rounds.                                                                  |
| 5               | Explosive force removes part of the target's foot and scatters it over a wide area. The target must make animmediate Toughness Test or permanently loses the use of his foot, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. On a success,the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and halves his movement until he receives medical attention. |
| 6               | The concussive force of the blast, shatters the target's leg bones and splits apart his flesh, inflicting 1d10 levelsof Fatigue. The leg is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. In addition, thehorrendous nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss.                      |
| 7               | The explosion reduces the target's leg into a hunk of smoking meat. The target must immediatelymake a Toughness Test or die from shock. On a successful Test, the target is still Stunned for 1d10Rounds, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.                                          |
| 8               | The blast tears the leg from the body in a geyser of gore, sending him crashing to the ground, bloodpumping from the ragged stump: instantly fatal.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 9               | The leg explodes in an eruption of blood, killing the target immediately and sending tiny fragmentsof bone, clothing, and armor hurtling off in all directions. Anyone within two metres of the targettakes a 1d10+2 Impact Damage.                                                                                             |
| 10+             | As above, except in addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these toodetonate on the target's person.                                                                                             |

| 6               | As the blow rips violently across the target's face— it takes with it an important feature. Roll 1d10 to seewhat the target has lost. 1–3: Eye (see Permanent Effects on page 201), 4–7: Nose (permanently halveFellowship), 8–10: Ear (permanently reduce Fellowship by 1d10; you can always hide the wound with yourhair.) In addition the target is now suffering Blood Loss and takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. |
| 7               | In a splatter of skin and teeth, the attack removes most of the target's face. He is permanently blindedand has his Fellowship permanently reduced to 1d10, and also now has trouble speaking without slurringhis words. In addition, the target is suffering from Blood Loss and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                      |

| 9               | With a sound not unlike a wet sponge being torn in half, the target's head flies free of its body and sailsthrough the air, landing harmlessly 2d10 metres away with a soggy thud. The target is instantly slain.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10+             | As above, except the target's neck spews blood in a torrent, drenching all those nearby and forcing themto take an Agility Test. Anyone who fails the Test, suffers a –10 penalty to his Weapon Skill and BallisticSkill Tests for 1 Round as gore fills his eyes or fouls his visor.                                                                                                                                |

|                 | that the target is now suffering from Blood Loss. He also takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.                             |

# **SPECIAL DAMAGE**

The horrors of battle are not the only way to die in the Dark Heresy universe. Acolytes may find themselves set on fire, suffocating to death, falling from a great height or, worst of all, exposed to the cold vacuum of space. These are collectively known as Special Damage and they are dealt with in this section.

# **Fire**

Characters take Damage each Round if exposed to fire. If you are exposed to the same fire source for two or more consecutive Rounds (or if you are hit with a Flame weapon as detailed in **Chapter V: armory, [page 128](#page-128-0)**), you must make an Agility Test each Round or catch on fire. Once you are blazing, you lose 1d10 Wounds (with no reduction for armor) and take 1 level of Fatigue each Round until the fire is extinguished. All Damage from fire is counted as Energy Damage for the purpose of Critical Damage, and applied to the body. When on fire, a character must make a Willpower Test to act normally, otherwise they may only run around and scream (count as a Full Action).

Once a character is on fire, he may try and put himself out by taking a Full Action and making a Hard (-20) Agility Test, i.e. stop, drop and roll. The GM may make this Test easier or harder depending on such factors as allies helping to beat out the flames, leaping into water or loose sand, high winds etc.

# **Falling**

Characters can fall off things for all manner of reasons, though the results are usually the same. To work out Damage from falling, find the distance fallen and consult **Table 7-27: Falling Damage** to work out the Damage the character suffers. Roll on the **Table 7-27: Hit Location, [page 194](#page-194-0)** to see which part of his body hits the ground first. armor offers no protection against falls. Damage from falling is counted as Impact Damage for the purpose of Critical Damage.

| Table 7-27: Falling Damage |         |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Distance Fallen            | Damage  |
| 3 metres                   | 1d10+3  |
| 6 metres                   | 1d10+5  |
| 9 metres                   | 1d10+7  |
| 12 metres                  | 1d10+9  |
| 15 metres                  | 1d10+11 |
| 18 metres                  | 1d10+13 |
| 21 metres                  | 1d10+15 |
| 24 metres                  | 1d10+17 |
| 25+ metres                 | 1d10+20 |
|                            |         |

# **Suffocation**

There are many ways to suffocate. Drowning is the most common, but the inhalation of smoke and certain gases also does the trick. The rate of suffocation depends on your activity level. If you are actively trying to conserve oxygen, you may hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your Toughness Bonus. Test Toughness each minute. A failure indicates that you take 1 level of Fatigue. If you do not gain a fresh source of oxygen at the end of this period, regardless of your Fatigue level you immediately fall unconscious and start to expire. From this point onwards, at the end of each Round, you take 1d10 Damage until you experience death once you reach 0 Wounds. armor or Toughness Bonus' do not reduce the Damage incurred.

# **Example**

*Shawnmaker, an Arbitrator with a TB of 3, is trapped in an airless corridor. Knowing that his allies are nearby with a lascutter, he decides to sit down and conserve his breath. Shawnmaker can hold his breath for three minutes, so his friends have just enough time to slice through the corridor walls. After the first minute of breath holding, Shawnmaker takes a level of Fatigue. After the second minute, he takes a further level of Fatigue. Finally, after the third minute Shawnmaker takes another level of Fatigue. If rescue does not arrive in the fourth minute Shawnmaker will take another level of Fatigue, fall unconscious and start to suffocate.*

If you are engaged in strenuous activity (combat, swimming and the like) you may hold your breath for a number of Rounds equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. After this period, you lose 1 Wound and gain a level of Fatigue at the end of each Round. Should you fall unconscious due to Fatigue, you take 1d10 Damage at the end of each Round until death. armor or Toughness Bonus do not reduce the Damage incurred.

# **Example**

*Shawnmaker has a TB of 3 and 9 Wounds. He can hold his breath under the murky waters of a hive sump for six Rounds before he begins to take Fatigue and lose Wounds. After a further four Rounds,* 

# **Vacuum**

There is nothing good about being exposed to vacuum. There are two ways this unfortunate event could occur: a character can be suddenly thrust into an airless, pressureless environment (such as being expelled from an airlock), or they can be slowly affected (such as being trapped on a star ship as its atmosphere is vented into space).

If suddenly exposed to vacuum, you may survive unharmed for a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus. Unless you have an oxygen source, you will also begin to suffer from the effects of suffocation. At the end of each Round after this, you suffer 1d10+3 Explosive Damage from depressurisation. If you are in the vacuum of space, at the end of each Round make a Toughness Test. A failure indicates that you suffer 1d10 Energy Damage from the extreme cold. In both cases, any armor worn does not reduce the Damage incurred.

If you die in space, it takes five Rounds for your corpse to freeze. If your corpse suffers any Damage whilst frozen, it shatters into thousands of blood-red ice shards. There is precious little, except perhaps a Daemonic pact, which can bring you back from such a fate.

If you are trapped in a gradually worsening atmosphere, you may survive unharmed for a number of Rounds equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. At the end of this time, you will begin to experience suffocation. You will also begin to feel the effects of depressurisation. From this point onwards, at the end of each Round you must make a Toughness Test with a cumulative –10 penalty. Success indicates that you take 1d5 Explosive Damage but are otherwise unaffected. Failure means that you suffer 1d10 Explosive Damage. In both cases armor will not reduce the Damage incurred.

*"Success is measured in blood; yours or your enemy's."* — *Tactica Imperialis.*

A As you accumulate Damage, you become more injured until finally, you suffer dreaded Critical Damage. How much Damage you have taken determines the severity of your injuries, describing whether you are Lightly, Heavily, or Critically Wounded. These states determine the time it takes to heal. You remove Damage at a fixed rate regardless of your level of activity. However, if you spend your time resting comfortably and not engaging in any strenuous activity (e.g. fighting, using Psychic Powers, herding Grox, etc.), you can remove Damage more quickly.

### **Lightly Wounded**

You are considered Lightly Wounded if you have taken Damage equal to or less than twice your Toughness Bonus. (if you have a 3 Toughness Bonus, then you are Lightly Wounded if you take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 Damage.) Without medical attention or drugs, you remove 1 Damage per day. If you spend this time resting in bed, you remove an amount of Damage equal to your Toughness Bonus.

### **Heavily Wounded**

You are Heavily Wounded whenever you have taken more Damage than twice your Toughness Bonus (so if you have 3 Toughness Bonus, you are considered Heavily Wounded if you have taken more than 6 Damage). Without medical attention, you remove 1 Damage per week through natural healing. If you spend the entire week resting, you remove an amount of Damage equal to your Toughness Bonus. Once your Damage is equal to or less than your Toughness Bonus, you become Lightly Wounded.

### **Critically Wounded**

You are Critically Wounded whenever you have taken Critical Damage. You do not recover without medical attention. With medical attention, you remove 1 point of Critical Damage for each week of rest. Once all Critical Damage has been removed, you become Heavily Wounded instead.

# **Medical Attention**

Medical attention is any Action by another character or by yourself to treat your injuries. Such efforts can range from the application of healing drugs, being the recipient of a successful Medicae Test, or even using Psychic Powers that can restore lost Wounds. Medical Attention can provide immediate recovery or can speed the process of natural healing. For more information, check out the Medicae skill in **Chapter III: Skills** on **[page 104](#page-104-0)**.

## **Blood Loss**

Characters suffering from Blood Loss have a 10% chance of dying each Round unless treated in some way. Provided the character is conscious, they may attempt a Medicae Test each Round to staunch the bleeding. If they are stationary whilst attempting to stop the blood, this test is merely Difficult (-10). If they are taking part in strenuous activity, such as combat or movement, this test is Very Hard (–30). If the character is not conscious, or doesn't fancy his chances, another character may attempt the test.

## **Broken Limbs**

Certain Critical Effects indicate a risk of permanently losing a limb. To avoid this fate, the character must succeed on a Toughness Test. Should a character with the Medicae skill be present and assisting the injured character, the victim gains a +20 bonus to this test to retain the limb. The limb must be held in a sling for 1d5+1 weeks and is useless during this time.

Should this test fail, the limb must be removed, requiring a character with the Medicae skill to succeed on a Difficult (-10) Medicae Test. Should this fail, the limb still comes off, but the surgery inflicts 1d10 Damage to the limb—almost always Critical Damage. Should the amputee live, the limb comes off, but he suffers Blood Loss and must be treated for it. Once this has been dealt with, the chirurgeon must treat the wound as if it were an amputated limb (see following).

### **Amputated Limbs**

A character that loses body parts (except for their heads—this pretty much means death, unless you have the good fortune of having your brain somewhere else in your body) is also affected by Blood Loss and must be treated for that first. Should this succeed and the character lives, someone with the Medicae skill must be found to adequately treat the stump to ensure that it heals well. If no medic is available, there is only a 20% chance that it will heal over. If it does not, the amputee dies a horrible death from infection after 1d10 days. Whether or not it heals naturally or a medic treats it, the character will not start removing Damage for 1d10+2 days.

### **Cybernetic and Bionic Replacements**

It is possible to restore lost limbs with bionic replacements; in fact, sometimes you may prefer to lop off a perfectly good arm or leg to gain the benefits of having a cybernetic one. The rules for both removing and attaching cybernetic, bionic and bio-enhanced limbs, implants and weapons are detailed fully in **Chapter V: armory**.

# **MOVEMENT**

*"Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment."* — Concordium dogma.

U Under most circumstances, you need only say that you want your character to go somewhere and eventually he gets there. How fast the character moves rarely matters in ordinary situations, but when it comes to some things, the speed with which a character can move can become very important. A chase through the streets, a charge against a brutal Ork or any number of other factors can all mean the difference between life and death.

During a Round, characters may move at one of four speeds: Half Move, Full Move, Charge, or Run. The number of metres a character may move in his Turn is determined by his Agility Bonus. Traits can modify some or all movement speeds. Details on these modes of movement can be found under Combat.

| Table 7-28: Movement (metres/round) |           |           |        |     |  |  |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|--|--|
| AB                                  | Half Move | Full Move | Charge | Run |  |  |
| 0                                   | 1/2       | 1         | 2      | 3   |  |  |

| 2                                   | 2         | 4         | 6      | 12  |  |  |
| 3                                   | 3         | 6         | 9      | 18  |  |  |
| 4                                   | 4         | 8         | 12     | 24  |  |  |
| 5                                   | 5         | 10        | 15     | 30  |  |  |
| 6                                   | 6         | 12        | 18     | 36  |  |  |
| 7                                   | 7         | 14        | 21     | 42  |  |  |
| 8                                   | 8         | 16        | 24     | 48  |  |  |
| 9                                   | 9         | 18        | 27     | 54  |  |  |

In some situations, it may be important to note how fast a character can travel in Narrative Time. **Table 7-29: Narrative Movement** describes the standard speeds a character can move at a leisurely pace under ideal circumstances. Environment (see following) can affect these speeds, hindering the characters as they travel.

| Table 7-29: Narrative Movement |                              |          |          |

| †                              | Assumes 10 hours of walking. |          |          |

# **Narrative Movement and Terrain**

Terrain conditions affect how fast your character can cover ground during Narrative Time. Obviously, picking your way through a death world jungle is far more laborious than moving along a major road.

Halve distances when moving through tightly packed foliage, dense urban areas or similarly difficult terrain.

The Game Master will determine what, if any, modifiers apply to Narrative Time caused by the environment.

# **Hurrying**

Characters can pick up the pace, moving up to double their movement in Narrative Time for a number of hours equal to their Toughness Bonus. At the end of this time, characters must successfully Test Toughness or take 1 level of Fatigue. In addition, hurrying characters are less likely to pay attention to their surroundings and thus take a –10 penalty to all Perception Tests. Characters may push on, even with these penalties, but they must Test Toughness, with a cumulative –10 penalty, again after a number of hours equal to their reduced Toughness Bonus or take additional levels of Fatigue.

# **Example**

*Lucretious is hurrying to reach a research outpost, so he covers 12 kilometres per hour. His Toughness is 41, so he can hurry for four hours before he needs to Test Toughness.*

# **Running and Narrative Time**

Characters can run during Narrative Time, but doing so is tiring. When running, a character triples his rate of movement, but each hour of sustained running requires the character to Test Toughness, with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour after the first, to sustain the pace. On a failed Test, the character takes 1 level of Fatigue. Characters moving at this brisk pace are focused on running and watching their steps, so they take a –20 penalty to all Perception Tests. As with hurrying, characters can continue running after a failed Test, but penalties gained from multiple failed Tests are cumulative.

# **Example**

*Kyba has a TB of 2 and runs to reach the village ahead of the Orks, some 30 kilometres away, who should arrive in four hours. She normally moves at 4kph. But because she's running, she's moving 12kph, meaning she'll reach the village in just over two hours if she can sustain the pace. After the first hour of running, she Tests Toughness and fails. She takes 1 level of Fatigue. After her second hour, she's covered 24 kilometres, but she needs to Test Toughness again, this time at a -20 penalty. She fails again! Half an hour later, Kyba reaches the village exhausted, having taken 2 levels of Fatigue.* 

There's nothing stopping characters from pushing themselves beyond the standard ten hours of marching. Characters may safely push themselves for a number of extra hours equal to their Toughness Bonus. Beyond this, a character must Test Toughness, with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour, for each hour he travels beyond his Toughness Bonus. A failed Test indicates that the character takes a level of Fatigue. It is possible to march oneself into unconsciousness. Fatigue taken from forced marching is removed after the character has rested for two hours for each hour they marched beyond their Toughness Bonus.

# **MOVEMENT AND ENVIRONMENT**

The movement rates for characters described on **Table 7-28: Movement (Metres/Round)** assume a relatively clear battlefield. There may be a few obstacles, puddles or wisps of fog, but characters can more or less, move at their standard rates. There are, however, some circumstances that reduce a character's speed. These can include rubble-strewn hallways, deep snow, dense fog, thick underbrush and a variety of other conditions that make it tough to navigate. In such environments, a character's movement is halved. If a character charges or runs, he must succeed on an Agility Test or fall prone. The difficulty of this Test depends on the terrain. See **Table 7-30: Treacherous Environments** for suggestions.

| Table 7-30: Treacherous Environments |                  |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| Condition                            | Difficulty       |
| Fog or Smoke                         | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Mud                                  | Challenging (+0) |
| Shallow Water                        | Challenging (+0) |
| Darkness                             | Difficult (–10)  |
| Snow                                 | Difficult (–10)  |
| Underbrush                           | Difficult (–10)  |
| Dense Crowds                         | Hard (–20)       |
| Zero Gravity                         | Hard (–20)       |
| Rubble                               | Hard (–20)       |
| Tremors                              | Hard (–20)       |

# **Forced Marching** **CLIMBING**

There are bound to be times when you want to climb over a wall, scale a cliff, or scramble up a tree to escape the claws of a vicious xenos. Any character with both hands free can climb any non-sheer surface with a Strength (or Climb) Test. On a success, you ascend or descend at a rate of one-half your Half Move speed (to a minimum of a 1/2 metre). For each degree of success, you climb an extra metre. On a failed Test, you fall from your starting climbing position. Climbing Difficulty varies with the nature of the climbing surface, though most tests should be Challenging (+0).

# **Sheer Surfaces**

Certain surfaces are beyond the means of ordinary characters to climb. Naked stone walls without hand-holds, vertical ascents and overhangs all require some skill at climbing to navigate. You may attempt a Climb Skill Test to climb these surfaces at one-half your Half Move speed. Otherwise, you must have tools such as a knotted rope or blanket, rope ladder or ladder. If you can take your time and are not threatened by opponents, you may ascend at one-half your Half Move rate without Testing Strength. You may try to climb more quickly or when you are being attacked, but you must Test Strength as if you were climbing a non-sheer surface.

# **Abseiling**

You can descend ropes and ladders more quickly by abseiling. You descend at a rate of 10 metres per Round with a successful Agility Test. If the Test is failed, the rate is reduced to 5 metres per Round. However, if the Test is failed by two or more degrees, you must Test Strength or lose your grip. Unless you have a climbing harness, you fall.

# **The Effects of Gravity**

Although the inhabited worlds of the Imperium may vary slightly in terms of gravity, the effects on game play are minimal. Only when characters explore high- or low-gravity worlds are movement, lifting and other factors affected.

### **Low Gravity Worlds**

On worlds of low gravity, all characters increase their Agility Bonus by 2 for the purposes of movement . In addition, characters add 4 to the total of their Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining carrying, lifting and pushing limits. Characters also add 2 to their Strength Bonus for determining how far they can throw objects. Double all Jumping and Leaping distances.

# **High Gravity Worlds**

On worlds of high gravity, all characters decrease their Agility Bonus by 2 (to a minimum of 1) for the purposes of movement. In addition, characters subtract 4 (to a minimum 0) from the total of their Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining carrying, lifting and pushing limits. Characters also subtract 2 from their Strength Bonus (to a minimum of 0) for determining how far they can throw objects. Finally, halve all Jumping and Leaping distances.

# **JUMPING**

A Jump is a controlled vertical ascent or descent that generally allows you to reach a ledge overhead or land on your feet. If you're pushed, or plummet, you're not Jumping but falling (see **Falling**).

# **Jumping Up**

You can make a standing Jump to hop up to reach something above you or land on a higher level. Doing so requires an Agility Test. On a success, you Jump up a number of centimetres equal to 20 times your Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, you add another number of centimetres equal to 10 times your Strength Bonus.

# **Example**

*Keira wants to Jump up and catch the lip of a ledge about one metre (100 centimetres) over her head. She has a 36 Strength (3 SB). She rolls and gets a 22. She succeeds with one degree of success. So, she Jumps up 90 centimetres ([SB×20]+30). Not quite enough for her to grab the edge of the ledge.*

# **Jumping Down**

When Jumping down, you must make an Agility Test for each metre of descent. On a failed Test, you stop making Agility Tests and fall the remaining distance. So if you fail the first Test, you fall the entire distance and take Damage for falling (see **Falling**).

# Leaping **LEAPING**

A Leap is a horizontal jump. It is used to traverse from roof to roof or to cross chasms, ditches and so on. There are two types of Leap: running and standing. In both cases, they are Full Actions.

# **Running Leaps**

In a Running Leap, you must move at least four metres in a straight line leading up to the Leap. At the end of your movement, you Leap across a number of metres equal to your Strength Bonus. Make a Strength Test. For each degree of success, you Leap an extra 50 centimetres. For each degree of failure, you Leap 50 centimetres less (minimum 0 metres—you probably move a few dozen centimetres, but not a full metre). For every four metres run up beyond those required for the Leap you get a +10 bonus (maximum +30) to your Strength Test.

# **Standing Leaps**

A Standing Leap is similar to a Running Leap, except, obviously, you don't have to run first. You calculate your distance as a running Leap, but you take a –10 penalty to your Strength Test.

# **Example**

*Our friend Keira is on a rooftop. To get onto the building containing her target, she must make a Leap of four metres. Keira has 36 Strength (3 SB) so she had better roll well or she's going to splatter on the street below. Keira backs up eight metres and then starts her run. She crosses the distance and then makes a Strength Test. Because she ran four extra metres, she gets a +10 bonus to her Strength Test. She rolls and gets a 26! A success by two degrees (36+10=46). If she had just succeeded on the Test, she would have leapt three metres, but because she got two degrees of success, she instead leapt four metres, which is just enough to cross the gap.*

# **Vertical Distance**

Should it be important, the height you attain while leaping is equal to one quarter the distance in metres travelled. A result of 0 or less means that you gained enough altitude to leap, but not enough to clear any obstacles.

# Swimming **SWIMMING**

A character doesn't need to make a Swim Test under ideal circumstances, but hazardous conditions such as rough waters, hands being tied, or swimming whilst fighting all require Swim Tests to move. To swim under hazardous conditions, you must make a Swim Test as a Move Action. A success indicates that you move in any direction up to a number of metres equal to one-half your Strength Bonus or simply tread water at your option. A failed Test means that you make no progress and cannot move. If you fail by 2 degrees or more, you sink one metre for every 20kg of your weight.

Characters that are unable to swim for some reason (unconsciousness, paralysis etc.) automatically sink one metre of depth for each 20kg of their weight on their Turn. Theoretically, a character could sink all the way to the bottom and walk their way out of the water if they can hold their breath long enough.

# **Swimming and Narrative Time**

Prolonged swimming can be exhausting. You may swim for a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus (simply substitute your Strength Bonus for Agility Bonus to determine how much distance you travel each hour). After this point, you must make a Toughness Test, with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour and each hour thereafter. On a failed Test, you take 1 level of Fatigue. If knocked unconscious from Fatigue, you sink and probably drown.

# **MOVING & LIFTING**

*"The mortal burden carried dutifully to its destination is the Emperor's greaTest praise."*

— *Lexconicum Moralis.*

N Normally, you don't need to keep track of how much of each item of your equipment you're carrying. Characters in Dark Heresy are assumed to be able to shoulder their backpacks, carry their weapons and don armor without being too hampered. However, there are likely to be instances where it's useful to know how much your character can reasonably lift.

The amount of weight a character can move depends on the sum of your character's Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus. Compare the total to **Table 7-31: Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing** to find out the limits of your might. Note that certain Traits may increase these values.

† *Carrying Weight indicates how much you can comfortably carry.*  ‡ *Lifting Weight describes how much you can lift off the ground.*  ¥ *Pushing Weight describes how much weight you can shove.*

# **EXCEEDING YOUR CARRYING LIMITS**

If you find yourself carrying more than your normal carrying limits and less than your lifting limit, you are encumbered. You take a –10 penalty to all movement-related Tests and reduce your Agility Bonus by 1 for the purposes of determining movement rates. In addition, after a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus have passed while carrying this weight, you must successfully make a Toughness Test or take 1 level of Fatigue.

While handling weights at your lifting or pushing limits, to move at your normal rate requires a Full Action.

You can try to lift or push more than your limit by Testing Strength. Each degree of success on a Strength Test adds a +1 bonus to the sum of your Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining your limits. If you fail this Test by 2 degrees or more, you take 1 level of Fatigue.

# **THROWING**

As described in **Chapter V: armory**, some weapons are designed to be thrown. The further away the target is from you, the harder it is to hit the target. While ranges for these weapons are determined by your modified Strength Bonus, this system doesn't cover objects not designed for throwing, such as bags of sand, bricks, and so on.

You can throw any object whose weight is equal to or less than half of your lifting weight. To see how far the object travels, Test Strength. A successful Test means that the object flies a number of metres equal to your Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, this distance increases by a factor of 1, so one degree means that you throw the object a number of metres equal to twice your SB, two degrees means that the object is thrown a number of metres equal to your SB×3, three degrees at SB×4 and so on. On a failed Test, the object flies a number of metres equal to half your Strength Bonus (round down; a result of 0 means it fell at your feet). If the object hits a hard surface such as a wall, it takes 1d10+SB Damage plus 1 for every degree of success on your Test.

If you're throwing such an object as an improvised weapon you must make a Ballistics Skill Test rather than a Strength Test. Throwing heavier objects more than half than your lifting weight, but no more than your lifting weight, imposes a Hard (–20) Test penalty.

# **LIGHTING**

*"If you dare enter these dark times, enter."*

— Ordos Hereticus Maxim.

Many adventures in Dark Heresy take place under the cover of night, in the shadowy depths of caves, or in the dank and foetid underhive. As a result, the oppressive darkness becomes a constant enemy, concealing countless terrors and monstrous threats in its depths. For these reasons, light sources are of paramount importance when exploring the dark places of the Imperium.

For simplicity, Dark Heresy uses three levels of light: Bright, Shadow and Darkness. Bright light is any light that allows normal vision, such as sunlight or being within the radius of a torch, glo-lantern, candle and so on. Shadow occurs whenever a normal light source is obscured such as by fog, distance or some similar effect. Darkness, naturally enough, is the absence of light.

Aside from the obvious effects of Darkness and Shadow—being the inability to see, areas of Shadow and Darkness can interfere with a character's movement and combat capabilities. Characters may move through areas of Shadow at no penalty, but may move at only half speed or less through Darkness. Exceeding this speed means that the character may drift in a random direction unless the character succeeds on a Hard (-20) Perception Test. For the effects of lighting on combat, see Combat.

# FLYING

*"It is my belief that foreign travel narrows the mind wonderfully."* — Helem Boesch, Ordo Xenos.

F lying is not a common occurrence for characters in Dark Heresy. Aside from certain rare pieces of tech, or managing to convince a flying creature to hold you, the odds are that the Acolytes will live and die with both feet on the ground. This said, there are plenty of creatures in the *Warhammer 40,000* universe that do benefit from the ability to fly and when they attack it changes the character of the battlefield in challenging ways. The following rules provide an abstract system for dealing with flying.

# **Altitude**

On a planet, there are three broad altitude levels: Hovering, Low, and High. You can change altitude by one level (up or down) during each Move Action taken. If you're using the Charge or Run Actions, you can change altitudes by two levels.

#### **Hovering**

Hovering means that you are skimming just above the ground, no higher than two metres. You can move over obstacles or pits with ease, but attacks can affect you as normal. You can both attack and be attacked by creatures on the ground.

#### **Low**

This altitude indicates that you are flying no more than 15 metres above the ground. You cannot attack or be attacked in melee, but ranged attacks and Psychic Powers are possible. You take no penalties for shooting downwards, but those firing up at you treat you as being 16 metres further away and take a -10 penalty to their Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack you.

### **High**

When flying at this altitude, you are flying far above the ground, beyond the range of all attacks, even those coming from low altitude. You can only attack or be attacked by other creatures flying at High altitude.

# **Example**

*Hybris has secured a powerful grav-harness, granting him a flying movement of 6. On the first Round, he goes from the ground to Hovering and moves 12 metres. On the second Round, he ascends from Hovering to Low altitude and moves another 12 metres. Should a renegade PDF trooper 24 metres away now shoot at Hybris, the Range would be 40 metres because flying at Low altitude adds 16 metres to the Range.*

# **Flying Movement**

Flying creatures and characters are broken up into two categories, each of which is a Trait (see **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists**). They are Hoverers and Flyers. Hoverers can move through the air, but are incapable of gaining more than 2 metres of altitude. A Flyer can go high into the sky, just like a bird.

Each Trait has an associated number. This number describes the character or creature's Flying Movement. This works just like regular movement, but applies only when the creature is flying. In the case of spells and other supernatural effects, Flying Movement is included in its description.

When flying, a character must spend at least one Move Action on his Turn each Round or he'll fall. Hoverers simply land, which causes no Damage. Flyers at Low altitude take Damage from a 15 metre fall, while those at High altitude take Damage from a 25+ metre fall. See **Falling** on **[page 210](#page-210-0)** for more details. The Charge, Attack and Run Actions both count as movement for the purposes of staying in the air.

**"We are at war with forces to terrible to comprehend. We cannot afford mercy for any of its victims too weak to take the correct course. Mercy destroys us; it weakens us and saps our resolve. Put aside all such thoughts. They are not worth of Inquisitors in the service of Our Emperor. Praise his name for in our resolve we only reflect his purpose of will."**
