# Chapter XIII: Illumination 
## Ideas for Follow-Up Adventures 

Whilst the Acolytes have, hopefully, dealt with the immediate threat posed by Aristarchus and Tsyiak, the work of the Inquisition never ceases. Corruption, deceit and heresy are always lurking, ever present, in the dark and grim world of *Warhammer 40,000*. What follows are some possible plot threads for followup adventures for you, the GM, to work up into full adventures.

## **Xenos Technology**

Aristarchus' Emperor's Tarot deck was exposed as being constructed with xenos technology, but where did it come from? The investigation into the source of the illegal technology continues in *Rejoice For You Are True* found in the Dark Heresy adventure anthology *Purge the Unclean*.

## **The Dancer at the Threshold**

Tsyiak is defeated but undeterred. The Daemon has yet again tasted the pleasures of realspace only to be cast back into the warp, serving to further fuel its anger and desire for revenge. The Dancer at the Threshold has a keen eye and will quietly search for a dark corner within one of the Acolytes' minds in which it can sow the seeds of corruption and downfall. Perhaps Tsyiak could become a major villain in your ongoing campaign of adventures, littering future missions with traps, deceit and murderous intent for the Acolytes to stumble upon. Over the course of time, disparate clues and encounters lead the Acolytes to realise that some unseen Daemonic hand is guiding their path into damnation, only to discover at the last that it has been their old enemy the Crow Father!

## **Heresy Begets Retribution**

After undergoing contamination testing at Bastion Serpentis, the Acolytes are (hopefully) declared free of warp taint. The Inquisition is uncertain that the situation is so crystal clear back on Iocanthos and the Acolytes are tasked with returning to Stern Hope to determine if any of the populace was infected by the Daemonic incursion brought about by Abbot Skae. In the time since the Acolytes were last there, Seth the Voice has been waging a war against Warchief Kos'ke and the other leaders of the Ashleen. Amid this ongoing slaughter, the Acolytes arrive and are courted by both sides eager to have the favour of the agents of the Imperium. Is this just another tribal war like countless others on Iocanthos? Or is the unseen hand of Tsyiak guiding events, drawing the Acolytes back to Stern Hope and the revenge of the Dancer at the Threshold?

## **Undercover**

As the time approaches for the next tithe of Ghostfire pollen to be collected, evidence of sabotage in and around Port Suffering comes to light. Port workers, tired of low-pay and harsh working conditions, murmur of rebellion. Bodies of murdered workers begin to appear, each choked to death by massive amounts of the pollen forced down their throats. Who is inciting rebellion and unrest in Port Suffering? Who is threatening the security of the port and the flow of the precious Ghostfire pollen? The Acolytes are sent in undercover, posing as workers themselves, to investigate the port worker guilds in order to seek out the root of the rebellious behaviour. They must discover who's committing the murders and put a stop to it all before the situation descends into a full-scale uprising and mutinous riot. Is this simply a case of defiance or does something corrupt and evil lurk in the shadows of Port Suffering?
†**Daemonic Presence:** Living creatures within 25 metres of an Astral Spectre feel chilled and unsettled. Shadows become unnaturally deep, and people may hear voices and glimpse eeting echoes of past events. Animals become restless and prone to panic, and machines suffer random glitches and breakdowns. All creatures take a –10 penalty to Willpower Tests.

**Threat Rating:** Malleus Minoris.

# **Charnel Daemon**

Accounts of encounters with the entity known as the Charnel Daemon are some of the most horrific records held by the Ordos Calixis. Powerful and singularly murderous, in order to gain a foothold in our reality, the Charnel Daemon must be summoned by extraordinarily bloody rituals performed by a powerful cult magus. Once manifested, it is in the form of an uncontrollable berserker, that will seek slaughter without end, working to remake the world in an image more pleasing to the Blood God.

| Charnel Daemon Profile |    |    |    |    |     |     |    |     |  |  |

‡**Fuelled By Slaughter:** Every time the Charnel Daemon kills a living creature, it heals 1d10 points of Damage. **Weapons:** Teeth and claws (1d10+10 R; Pen 3, Tearing). **Threat Rating:** Malleus Majoris.

# **Incarnate Lesser Daemon**

The shapes and blasphemous hungers that a Daemon might exhibit are without number, and literally thousands of different manifestations are recorded within the restricted archives of the Ordo Malleus. Many reflect the nature and drives of their patrons among the powers of Chaos, acting as foot soldiers in the legions of hell, while others represent the congealed stuff of mankind's worst fears and hidden evils. Regardless of their shape, incarnate Daemons are formed from the pure substance of the warp and cannot maintain their grip on our universe without the aid of bloodshed, misery and death.

# **Bloodletters**

Horned and bloody, these Daemon-warriors serve Khorne, the Chaos power of murder and slaughter. They exist only to kill and often materialise clad in bronze armor and wielding vicious hell-forged blades.

# **Daemonettes**

Lascivious and obscene, these She-Daemons serve the depraved Chaos power Slaanesh. Lean, lithe and hypnotic in their blasphemous allure, they tear their prey apart with their razor-sharp, crab-like claws.

# **Dispayres**

Famished and tattered figures with hollow eye-sockets and mouths frozen in endless silent screams, these Daemons serve no single great power; they desire only to bring sorrow and madness. Darkness clings about them, and they make formidable stalkers and assassins for malefic cults.

# **horrors**

Rolling, twisting, twitching masses of iridescent flesh and fire. Horrors serve their master Tzeentch, Chaos power of change, intrigue and sorcery. Their many mouths scream and gibber, and their shifting, clawed hands twitch with incantations.

# **PsYchNeueIN—the mara straIN**

Thankfully rare, Psychneuein are vile warp entities drawn to the mental emanations of unprotected, badly injured or nascent psykers whose minds they attack for the obscene purpose of gestating their progeny. Psychneuein have been known to evidence various distinct genus, of which the Mara Strain is deemed among the most dangerous.

### **The Mara Strain**

The Mara Strain was first identified by Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Ark-Ashtyn during a heavy infestation at the mining penitentiary on the ice-world of Mara in the Calixis Sector, three centuries ago. Although the Mara facility was subsequently decommissioned, the tale of the "ice station massacre" remains a favourite dark fable among the sector's spacefarers. Since then, confirmed incidents of Mara infection have occurred on the sector worlds of Dusk, Lachrymae and Pellucida V as well as several vessels transiting near Mara, although these incidences remain thankfully very few.

#### **The Infested—Final Stage Mania**

The victim can be any creature with a Psy Rating of 1 or more. Apply all of the following modifications:

- Halve Intelligence and Fellowship Characteristics
- Increase Psy Rating by 1.
- Gain Corpus Conversion, Die Hard, Fearless talents.
- Gain immunity to Stun.
- • Creatures that attempt to establish any form of telepathic contact with the infected creature suffer a psychic backlash and takes a level of Fatigue.

• If the infected creature attempts a Psychic Power that results in Perils of the Warp, instead of rolling to see what happens, 1d10 adult psychneuein are born, killing the host in the process.

• If the psyker is slain, there is a 25% chance of 1d10 adult Psychneuein appearing. Otherwise, 1d10 larvae erupt instead.

### **Larval Form**

**Weapons:** Feeding tube (1d10+6 R; Warp). **Threat Rating:** Malleus Extremis.

# **Plaguebearers**

Bloated and malformed, clutching rusted butcher blades and glaring out with a single milky-white eye, these foulest of Daemons are walking incubators of the most terrible diseases and excrescence, serving Nurgle, Chaos power of decay and contagion.

**Weapons:** Claws and teeth (1d10+3 R; Primitive, Tearing) or sword (1d10+3 R, Pen 2, Balanced, Toxic (1d10)). **Threat Rating:** Malleus Minoris.

# **Unclean Spirit**

The warp is a place of myriad horrors and numberless dangers, and the entities that seethe and boil within its turbulent depths range from the vast powers of the so-called Chaos gods to mindless, verminous predators. The Ordo Malleus classifies some in this latter category as unclean spirits, and while they lack the reality-damaging powers of true Daemons, they can still prove dangerous if loosed on the world.

Those without this ability may still sense the unclean spirit's presence with a Difficult (-10) Awareness Test if in its immediate area. This registers as a feeling of deep unease, a sudden chill or an unaccountable foul stench.

**Psychic Powers (Psy Rating 1):** Sense Presence, Spectral Hands, Warp Howl.

**Weapons:** None.

**Threat Rating:** Malleus Minima.

#  Daemonhosts

Daemonhosts are unholy creations of foul and dangerous rituals in which a powerful Daemon is bound into a living human host body and enslaved to its creator's will. An utterly foul act, the creation of a Daemonhost condemns the soul of the host body to eternal torment and provides a lasting home in the universe for a Daemon to work its evil. Despite the horror of their creation, there are those within the Inquisition itself, it is said, who have dared to replicate the act, hoping to turn their creations against enemies of the Imperium. Unfortunately, Daemonhosts are not only the preserve of a handful of Radical Inquisitors. Insane dabblers in proscribed knowledge and the most powerful of cults have also been known to create Daemonhosts to serve them in their designs. Daemons do not rest easily under the will of any mortal, and to earn the enmity of such a creature is to gain an immortal enemy, so a Daemonhost's creator is faced with a dangerous conundrum: the more powerful the Daemonhost created, the weaker the bindings of the Daemon.

### **Daemonhost Generator**

The generator included here is intended to give you a quick way of creating these most potent opponents, or even allies, of the Inquisition, while also giving you ideas to customize your own Daemonhosts.

#### **The Method**

Creating a Daemonhost has seven stages as detailed below:

**Stage One:** Roll on **Table 12-5: Binding** to determine how many times the Daemonhost has been bound. **Stage Two:** Generate the Daemonhost's Characteristics. **Stage Three:** Generate the changes wrought on the host body. **Stage Four:** Generate the phenomena of the Daemonhost's presence.

**Stage Five:** Generate the Daemonhost's Psychic Powers. **Stage Six:** Determine Skills and Traits.

**Stage Seven:** Add your own finishing touches.

#### **Stage One: Binding**

The less strongly bound a Daemonhost is, the more powerful it will be; but the weaker the binding, the greater the chance the Daemon has to slip its master's control.

### Table 12-5: Binding

#### **Roll Effect**

- 01–10 **Unbound:** The Daemon, within its host, has broken free of its fetters. Such a creature is the walking embodiment of the corrupting power of the warp.
- 11–40 **Once-bound:** A Daemonhost that has the least number of bindings placed on it is apocalyptically powerful, but only barely contained.
- 41–70 **Twice-bound**: More powerfully bound, a Daemonhost is still extremely dangerous, but its raw power is tempered and more easily controlled.
- 71–00 **Thrice-bound:** The most strongly bound Daemonhosts are the least likely to rebel, but are still not without inhuman strength and power.

# **Stage Two: Characteristics**

Once you have determined the extent of the Daemonhost's binding, cross-reference this with the profile given in the following table to give the Daemonhost's Characteristics.

| Table 12-6: Daemonhost Characteristics |         |            |             |              |
|----------------------------------------|---------|------------|-------------|--------------|

| Fellowship (Fel)                       | 5+2d10  | 5+2d10     | 5+2d10      | 5+2d10       |
| Wounds                                 | 30      | 30         | 30          | 30           |
| Psy Rating                             | 8       | 6          | 5           | 4            |

# **Stage Three: Unholy Changes**

Daemonhosts are covered with chains and amulets, their skin punctured by needles and their flesh etched with sigils. The host body beneath the bindings is warped by the terrible essence trapped within it. To determine what changes have been visited on the Daemon's fleshy prison, roll on **Table 12-7: Unholy Changes** that follows.

For unbound Daemonhosts, roll 1d5+1 times; for once-bound, roll 1d5; for twice-bound, roll 1d5–1 (minimum once); and for thrice-bound, roll 1d5–2 (minimum once). In all cases, re-roll duplicate results.

| 97–00 | Seeming Normality: If you roll this result, do not roll any further on this table. Also, any results already rolled are removed. The host body seems perfectly normal, apart from the instruments of its binding. It adds 1d10 to its Fellowship. |


### **Stage Four: Daemonic Presence**

The very presence of a Daemonhost has an effect on its surroundings. The diameter of this area is equal to the Daemon's Willpower Characteristic in metres. Within this area, all characters experience a particular set of phenomena and take a -10 penalty to Willpower Tests. The number of phenomena caused depends on how strongly the Daemonhost is bound: unbound Daemonhosts cause four phenomena; once-bound Daemonhosts cause three phenomena; twice-bound Daemonhosts cause two phenomena; and thrice-bound Daemonhosts cause one phenomenon. For each phenomenon the Daemonhost has, roll once on **Table 12-8: Daemonic Phenomena** that follows. Re-roll any duplicate rolls.

| 25–28 | …a single high-pitched note can be heard.                                                                         |

# Example Daemonhost:

# **HEDRODAL**

### **Twice-bound Daemonhost**

Created by the false prophets of the Pilgrims of Hayte using the unwilling body of the fallen Interrogator Cripon, Hedrodal is a foul thing. A long purple snaketongue flicks from between its grinning teeth, glowing eyes burn with an icy light and its chain-crossed flesh is covered in rolling eyes and glistening boils. Everywhere Hedrodal passes there is the sound of nameless things scuttling, and lurking shadows of horrible visage can be seen inhabiting the darkness around it.
