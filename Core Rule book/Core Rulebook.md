# Chapter VII: Playing the Game

*"You have been chosen to serve the God-Emperor of Mankind with your very lives! But before you are even worthy to honour Him with your demise there are some things you need to know..."* — Inquisitor Saffena Sengir, Ordo Xenos.

I I n the service of the Holy Inquisition, Acolytes are called upon to perform all manner of tasks, such as rooting out heretics, travelling through the warp and combating the many foes of mankind. To achieve these things, characters need to draw upon all their skills and abilities. Having created your character, this chapter explores all the different sorts of things your Acolyte might have to do in the service of the God-Emperor.

*"There is nothing to fear but failure."*

— Warmaster Slaydo.

A As your Acolyte undertakes adventures, explores strange environments and exposes villainy, he will engage in all manner of actions. Shooting a lasgun, scaling a cliff wall, avoiding the power sword of a heretic: these are just a sample of the typical sorts of things your character might face in his service to an Inquisitor. While it might be sufficient to say that you can or cannot achieve these things, Dark Heresy uses a system for resolving the challenges that characters must overcome during game play.

The basic way of determining success or failure is determined by what is called a "Test". Whenever the action, task or effort could have dramatic consequences—things that affect the story, your character's health and so on—you must take a Test. To do so make a percentile dice roll. See **Reading and Rolling the Dice** on **[page 9](#page-9-0)** for more information on how to do this. Now compare the result rolled to the Characteristic that best describes the action you're attempting. If you roll lower than or equal to the Characteristic, you succeed. If you roll higher than the Characteristic, you fail.

**If the d100 roll is greater than the Characteristic, you fail. If the d100 roll is equal to or less than the Characteristic, you succeed.**

# Skill Tests 
The most common sorts of Tests you have to take during play are Skill Tests. Every skill (see **Chapter III: Skills**) is governed by a particular Characteristic. For example, the Agility Characteristic governs the Dodge skill. Whenever you would use a Skill—again, for any Action with dramatic consequences—you make a Skill Test, making a percentile dice roll as described above.

# **Example**

*Drake, a Veteran Guardsman with Agility 34, fights a hive ganger. The unwashed hive scum makes a successful attack with his lead pipe. Drake has the Dodge skill, so he tries to get out of the way. Drake's player makes a Dodge Test, rolling 42 on his percentile dice. Since this is over Drake's Agility characteristic, the ill-fated Guardsman fails and the ganger's weapon strikes home.*

You can sometimes make Skill Tests even when you do not actually have the Skill. You can only make Skill Tests with Skills you do not have if the Skill is a Basic Skill. Advanced Skills require specialised training and experience. If you don't have the Advanced Skill, you can't make the attempt.

When making a Skill Test with a Basic Skill you do not have, roll as normal, but halve the Characteristic (round up).

Many Talents (see **Chapter IV: Talents**) can improve your chances of success, as can Skill Mastery (see **[page](#page-96-0)**  <span id="page-183-0"></span>**[96](#page-96-0)**). Talented, for example, provides a +10 bonus on Skill Tests made with any one Skill.

# **Example**

*Nursing a nasty lump on his head, Drake tries to bargain down the price of a medi-kit from a local hive merchant. He doesn't have the Barter skill, but Barter is a Basic Skill so he can give it a try anyway. Drake has a Fellowship 34, but he must halve it because he doesn't have the skill. He must roll below or equal to 17 (34/2=17) to successfully haggle the price down. Drake rolls a 15—a success! He has managed to convince the merchant to lower the price.*

# Characteristic Tests

Sometimes you may want to do something that is not covered by a Skill (using brute force to knock down a door, for example). In these cases, you make a Characteristic Test instead of a Skill Test. The GM determines the most appropriate Characteristic for what you're trying to do. Then roll a percentile dice and compare the roll to the Characteristic. As with Skill Tests, if the roll is equal to or less than the Characteristic you succeed; if the roll is greater than the Characteristic you fail.

# **Example**

*Kiera, a Death Cult Assassin, runs across a narrow gantry high above a space port in the driving rain. The gantry is very narrow and extremely slippery, but with the Crimson Alliance in pursuit, Kiera is not going to slacken her pace. The GM calls for an Agility Test. Kiera's Agility is 37. She rolls the dice and gets a 26, enough to safely cross the gantry, leaving her enemies behind.*

# **Using Characteristics**

For everything not covered by Skills, you should always fall back to Characteristic Tests. See **Table 7–1: Characteristic Tests** for examples of typical Characteristics Tests.

# **Characteristic Bonuses**

Except for Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill, all Characteristics have an associated bonus. The Characteristic Bonus is equal to the tens digit of the Characteristic. For example, Jonas has a 45 Toughness, so his Toughness Bonus is 4. Adriel has a 36 Perception, so her Perception Bonus is 3. Since these bonuses are determined by the Characteristic, they may rise and fall throughout the adventure. Should a Characteristic take a penalty, that penalty likewise applies to the Characteristic Bonus.

# **Example**

*Drake, who's Toughness is 45, is suffering from poisoning, and therefore takes a –10 penalty to all Toughness Tests. This means that his Toughness functions as if it is 35. Thus Drake's Toughness Bonus, for as long as he takes the penalty, is reduced to 3.*

# **Using Characteristic Bonuses**

Characteristic Bonuses are used in a number of ways. Usually they are added to a dice roll to give a modified result. For example, to ascertain the Damage inflicted by a successful attack with a club, you roll 1d10 and add your Strength Bonus (1d10+SB).

| Table 7–2: Characteristic Bonuses |                                                          |  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Characteristic                    | Example Tests                                            |  |
| Strength Bonus                    | Used to determine Damage from meleeattacks.          |  |
| Toughness                         | Used to resist Damage taken in combat.                   |  |
| Agility                           | Used to determine Initiative.                            |  |
| Intelligence                      | Used with Skills, the Medicae skill forexample.      |  |
| Perception                        | Used with Skills, the Psyniscience skillfor example. |  |
| Willpower                         | Used with Focus Power to manifest                        |  |
|                                   | Psychic Powers.                                          |  |
| Fellowship                        | Used when interacting with people.                       |  |

**"Mankind stands upon the brink; on the one hand lies a realm of unimaginable power, on the other awaits darkness, death and utter damnation. Only those that follow the guiding light of the Emperor may save their souls."**

Sometimes you will be asked to add or subtract a number from a Characteristic Bonus before you apply it to a result. For example, to ascertain the Damage inflicted by a successful hammer attack, you roll 1d10 and add your Strength Bonus minus one (1d10+SB-1).

In addition, Characteristic Bonuses can be used to break ties—see **Opposed Skill Tests** for more details.

# **DEGREES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE**

For most tests, it is enough to know whether you succeeded or failed. Sometimes, however, it is useful to know how well you succeeded, or how badly you failed. This is particularly important with social skills like Charm and Inquiry, as it gives the GM a guideline to help determine Non-Player Character (NPC) attitudes and to portion out the information attained.

Measuring degrees of success and failure is straightforward. Compare the result of your Test with your score. For each full 10 points by which you exceed your Characteristic, you achieve one degree of success. Conversely, for each full 10 points by which you fail, you gain one degree of failure. Your GM will let you know if degrees of success or failure are important for a particular Test.

# **Example**

*Father Horst is boasting, none too truthfully, of his success in smiting mutants. He makes a Deceive Test. Since Deceive is a Fellowship-based skill, Father Horst must roll beneath his Fellowship Characteristic to successfully convince the drill-abbots that his actions were indeed "like the Imperial heroes of old". Horst rolls 12 against a Fellowship of 44. Not only does he succeed, he beats his target by 3 degrees of success (44–12 = 32). The Drill-Abbots completely believe his tale and decide that, as Horst is such a hero, he is best employed at the front line of a local war.*

# Extended Tests 

Some tasks are quite complicated and may take extra time to finish. In these cases, the GM may decide that it takes more than one successful Skill Test to complete the task. This is known as an Extended Test. Generally, the Skill in question will describe whether it requires an Extended Test, though the GM may adjust the time represented by each Test depending on what is in fact being attempted.

# Opposed Skill Tests 

Sometimes you have to Test your Skill against that of an opponent. This is known as an Opposed Skill Test. If you were trying to hide from a searching Guardsman, for example, you would make a Concealment Test, while the Guardsman would make an Awareness Test. In these situations, both

parties make Skill Tests as normal. Whoever succeeds on the Test wins. If both participants succeed, the one with the most degrees of success wins. If the degrees of success are the same, the higher Characteristic Bonus wins out. And if this still results in a tie, then the lowest dice roll wins.

Should both parties fail, one of two things occurs. Either there is a stalemate and nothing happens or both parties should re-roll until there is a clear winner.

# **Example**

*Having eluded the Crimson Alliance on the gantry, Kiera is now trying to sneak out of the space port and past one of their sentries. The GM calls for a Silent Move Test and opposes it with the sentry's Perception Test. Both the player and the GM roll. Kiera must roll below 37 and the sentry must roll below 30. Kiera rolls a 24 for a success, while the GM gets a 28, also a success. Kiera beat her number by 13 while the sentry beat his only by 2. As Kiera has the greater degree of success, she manages to slip past and off into the night.*

# **THE ROLE OF CIRCUMSTANCE**

Not all Skill Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is quite easy, for instance, but ascending the face of a sheer cliff is quite difficult. The GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Skill or Characteristic Tests depending on the circumstances. While published adventures define these modifiers for the GM, there are many instances where the GM has to determine them on the wing. Making judgements like this is a big part of being a Game Master.

For each Test, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult **Table 7–3: Test Difficulty** to determine the appropriate modifier. GMs may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in extremely unusual situations. It is recommended that all modifiers be given out in 10-point increments to keep the numbers simple. GMs who prefer more finesse, however, may hand out modifiers in 5-point increments.

# **Example**

*Vos, a Feral warrior, tries to find the tracks of an unruly Grox he is hunting. He makes a Tracking Test. Under normal circumstances, he'd simply use his Intelligence Characteristic as his base chance of success. However, the GM decides that the rain last night washed away most of the tracks. He deems the task Very Hard and imposes a –30 penalty on Vos's Skill Test. His Intelligence is 41, with the penalty, he has to roll under an 11 (41–30=11) to succeed. Vos rolls a 35, which would have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this instance the rain foiled him and the test is failed. To make matters worse, Vos failed the Test by more than 20, so the GM rules that he becomes lost for 1d5 hours.*

# **ASSISTANCE**

In some situations, multiple characters working together have a better chance of completing the task than if a character attempts it alone. With the GM's permission, a character can assist another character that's taking a Test. When doing so, the character with the best chance to succeed rolls the dice. Each character assisting reduces the Difficulty by one step. If the Test succeeds, the character who rolled the dice gains an extra degree of success.

| Table 7-3: Test Difficulty |               |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Difficulty                 | Test Modifier |
| Easy                       | +30           |
| Routine                    | +20           |
| Ordinary                   | +10           |
| Challenging                | +0            |
| Difficult                  | –10           |
| Hard                       | –20           |
| Very Hard                  | –30           |

# **Limits on Assistance**

Characters can assist each other in most tasks but there are limits:

- To assist, both characters must have the Skill being Tested.
- The assisting character must be adjacent to the character taking the Test.
- You cannot assist on Reactions or Free Actions.
- •Youmaynot assistonTestsmade toresistdisease,poison,Fear, hazards or anything else the GM deems inappropriate.
- No more than two characters may attempt to assist another.

# **Example**

*Hannah and Boris search a room. The GM declares that a Challenging (+0) Search Test is required, so Boris decides to help Hannah rather than search on his own. Since Boris is helping, the Difficulty drops to Ordinary (+10). If Hannah, who has the higher Perception, succeeds, she gains an extra degree of success because of Boris's help.*

# The role of Fate
*"There is no fate, but what the Emperor makes."* — Catechism of the Founding, Gunmetallicus 104th.

A All Player Characters begin play with a number of Fate Points. The number of Fate Points a character receives is decided during character creation. Fate Points are what separates Acolytes from the ordinary people of the Imperium. PCs have destinies and the Emperor has marked them for greater things. While their ultimate fate is a mystery, with no guarantees that it will be glorious, enriching or pleasant, they are a cut above the rest.

# Using Fate Poin ts **USING FATE POINTS**

Fate Points allow you to turn luck to your advantage, hitting with that bolter shot when you would have otherwise missed, or cracking the security code on a door just in time to make a hasty escape. Using these twists of fate, you can take a few more risks, which makes the game faster and far more exciting than would otherwise be the case.

That said, you have a limited pool of Fate Points and whenever you spend a Fate Point, you reduce your pool by one, so choose wisely. Fate Points are restored at the start of the next gaming session. Spending a Fate Point allows a character to do one of the following things:

- Re-roll any one failed Test. The results of the re-roll are final.
- Count as having rolled a 10 for their Initiative.
- Add an extra degree of success to a Test.
- Instantly recover 1d5 Wounds.
- Recover from being Stunned.

# Bur n ing Fate **BURNING FATE**

Sometimes a re-roll or an extra degree of success is not going to be enough to save a character's life. In these instances, the character may choose to burn a Fate Point and permanently reduce their Fate Points by 1. The result is that the character survives whatever it was that would have killed him, but only just. So for example, if the character was shot with a lascannon and suffered a Critical Hit that would have killed him, instead he will only be horribly wounded, hideously burnt and rendered unconscious on 0 Wounds. In more extreme circumstances, such as being trapped on a space ship during a warp drive implosion, it is up to the player and the GM to work out just how the character makes his escape.

Note that you may burn a Fate Point even if you have already used all of your Fate Points for that gaming session. This just means that at the start of the next session, when your points are restored, you will have 1 less Fate Point.

# Gaining Addition al The Role Fate Poin ts **GAINING ADDITIONAL FATE POINTS**

Since Fate Points are an expendable resource, you may be reluctant to burn them for fear of never gaining more. However, as your character undertakes adventures, he may gain additional Fate Points to replenish those that have been burnt away. Your GM may grant Fate Points for particular acts of heroism, cunning or good role playing. See **Chapter VIII: The Game Master** for details.

**"The foolish man puts his trust in luck, the wise man puts his trust in the Emperor."**

# **INVESTIGATION**

*"Wisdom is the beginning of fear."*

— Ordos Hereticus maxim.

A Another key element of Dark Heresy games is, of course, investigation. Over the course of an adventure, you are likely to spend a fair amount of time pouring through dusty libraries, searching through forbidden texts or chatting with the locals to uncover the heresy you seek. **Chapter III: Skills** offers a number of Investigation skills, such as Inquiry, Scholastic Lore, Forbidden Lore and so on, to help you through this process.

# Using Investig ation Skills **USING INVESTIGATION SKILLS**

In many cases, clues come as a result of achieving certain objectives in the game. You might travel to another planet to search through ancient xenos ruins, before heading on to a hive-city to find someone who knows a bit about what you found, only to head back to a shrine world to find the corrupted priest who heads up a cult to the Dark Powers. All of these instances can result from knowing where to look, who to talk to, and where to go once you find the information you seek. Sometimes, though, you may need to roll up your sleeves and do some digging to discover the truth. Examples of investigation could be to find out the background to a forbidden planet, to learn more information about a xenos, or to research a particularly famous figure in the history of the Imperium. Luckily, all Investigation skills work the same way.

All Investigation tests require a character to have access to an Investigation skill. The Difficulty of the Test depends on its complexity, which also determines the base time it should take to uncover the information sought. A success on the Test allows you to roll 1d10 and add the appropriate Characteristic Bonus (as determined by the Characteristic used for the Test) and subtract this value in hours from the time it takes to uncover the information sought. A failed Test indicates no progress gained. Failing by three or more degrees indicates a setback, adding 1d10 hours to the total time required by the Test. Failing by five or more degrees means that your investigation comes to a complete halt and that the information's complexity increases by two steps. Once you reduce the time to 0 or less, you get the available information on the subject you're investigating.

**Table 7–4: Investigation Benchmarks** offers a selection of example Difficulties, times and Actions based on secrecy. As with many other Tests, you may benefit from assistance from other Player Characters subject to the same limitations described under Assistance (see **Assistance, [page 184](#page-184-0)**).

Investigation should never be used to replace role playing or participating in adventures, but rather to augment role playing and assist in arriving at the facts of a matter.

*"Strike fast and suddenly. Attack without warning. Secure victory before the foe is aware of his danger. Remember always, a war is easily won if your enemy does not know he is fighting."* — *Tactica Imperialis*.

M Make no mistake: the Imperium is a dangerous place. Over the course of their investigations, explorations and travels, the characters are bound to encounter those who would see them dead. Unless the characters plan to spend their lives running away from their enemies, they will have to make a stand and fight. As a result, combat can form a key component in your Dark Heresy game. Being familiar with the ins and outs of battle can only improve your chances of survival.

# Roun ds, Tur ns & Tim e **ROUNDS, TURNS & TIME**

For most occasions whilst playing Dark Heresy , the GM simply describes the scene or situation and asks the players how they react. Time is flexible, and is subject to the GM's decision based on the choices the characters make. Whilst the GM should have an idea about how much time approximately passes, it's not necessary to track the passage of time down to the exact second, or even the minute or hour. It is enough to say that "it takes about an hour to reach the spectral vestibule" or "after about fifteen minutes of walking, you come upon a crashed Aquila Lander". This sort of approach is known as "game time" or "Narrative Time".

In contrast to the loose laws of Narrative Time, there are many situations when every second counts and the GM must closely monitor what is going on. It might be that the GM needs to adjudicate a furious sword fight, or to track the characters' pace as they pursue fleeing cultists through the alleys of Gunmetal City.

| Table 7-4: Investigation Benchmarks |             |          |                                        |           |

When playing in such detailed moments of time, the Surprise GM must slice the action up into Rounds and Turns. A Round is approximately five seconds of Action. During a Round, participants in the encounter each have a Turn to act. Each character's Turn overlaps slightly, so Actions are almost simultaneous within the Round. Combat is the most common time that players will encounter detailed time or "Combat Time", but is by no means the only circumstance where Rounds and Turns are used. See **Movement** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)** for more details.

# **COMBAT OVERVIEW**

Each character, including NPCs, takes a Turn within the Round. It is therefore necessary to determine the order in which Actions are taken. When combat begins, follow these steps to determine what happens.

# **Step One: Surprise**

When beginning a combat, the GM determines if any of the combatants are Surprised. This only affects the first Round and isn't always necessary even then. Surprised combatants lose their Turn on the first Round of combat. They are caught unawares and their opponents get a full Round's "drop" on them. If no one is Surprised, then move immediately onto Step Two.

# **Step Two: Roll Initiative**

At the start of the first Round, each combatant must roll for Initiative. Each combatant rolls 1d10 and adds his Agility Bonus (the tens digit of his Agility characteristic). The result of the roll applies for all successive Rounds in the combat.

# **StepThree: Determine InitiativeOrder**

The GM ranks all the Initiative rolls, including those of the NPCs and creatures, from highest to lowest. This is the order that characters will act in during each Round of combat.

# **Step Four: Characters Take Turns**

Starting with the participant with the highest Initiative roll, each character takes a Turn. During his Turn, a character can perform one or more Actions. Once a character has finished his Actions, the next participant takes a Turn and so on.

# **Step Five: Round Ends**

Once each participant has taken a Turn, the Round is over.

# **Step Six: Repeat Steps Four and Five as Needed**

Continue to play successive Rounds until the combat is complete or until you finished whatever it is that triggered the switch from Narrative Time to Combat Time.

# **SURPRISE**

Surprise only affects the first Round of combat. It is up to the GM to decide if any of the combatants are Surprised. Ultimately, this comes down to a judgement call on the GM's part, based on the circumstances and the Actions of the various combatants leading up to the encounter. The GM should take the following into account when determining Surprise:

- Is anyone hiding? Successful use of the Concealment skill before the combat may mean that some combatants are hidden. Extremely wary characters may oppose this with a Perception Test.
- Is anyone sneaky? Successful use of the Silent Move skill may have positioned some characters for an ambush. Again, wary opponents may oppose this with a Perception Test.
- Are there any unusual circumstances that would mask the approach of attackers? This can cover nearly anything, from pouring rain to whining engines to nearby explosions.
- Are there any distractions? It's possible that something quite distracting is going on. A cultist's attention may be so fixated on the sermon of his confessor that he doesn't notice his attackers approaching.

Bearing all of this in mind, the GM must decide which combatants are Surprised. Whilst it's often the case that one entire side or the other is Surprised, there can be individual exceptions. For example, mutants may easily Surprise a unit of green Guardsmen, but not their keeneyed commissar.

If no one is Surprised, proceed with the combat as normal. Surprised characters lose their Turn in the first Round. They can do nothing except stand dumbfounded whilst their opponents fall upon them, with the attackers gaining +30 to hit during the first Round of combat only. After the first Round, Surprised characters recover their wits and can act normally.

# **Example**

*Having dealt with one group of cultists, Mordechai and Drake continue on their mission only to fall foul of an ambush by more members of the Barbed Chalice. The combat begins when the cultists attempt to shoot their autoguns at the Acolytes from concealed positions. The GM decides that Mordechai and Drake are Surprised. The cultists aim and shoot at the unlucky Acolytes. Since they are Surprised, Mordechai and Drake do not get a chance to act. Once the cultists have taken their shots, the Surprise Round ends. The GM starts at the top of the Initiative order for Round two and the combat proceeds as normal.*

each Round. To determine Initiative, roll 1d10 and add the result to the character or NPC's Agility Bonus. Naturally, the GM rolls the Initiative of any NPCs and creatures present.

GMs can make one Initiative roll for each group of like characters. For example, if there are three gangers in the combat, all of which have the same Characteristics, it isn't necessary to roll Initiative separately for each ganger. One roll will do for all of them and they'll act at the same time in the Initiative order.

# **Example**

*Mordechai, an Arbitrator with AB of 3 (the tens digit from his Agility of 35), rolls for Initiative when his group is attacked by three cultists of the Barbed Chalice. He rolls a 6 on a d10, so his Initiative for this combat is 9 (6+3). His companion, Drake, gets an 8 and the cultists 7. So, Mordechai goes first, followed by Drake, and then by the cultists.*

Once everyone has rolled, the GM makes a list and places each character or creature in order, from highest to lowest. This is the order the combatants act in each Round, until the combat is over.

If more than one character has the same Initiative, they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they also have the same Agility then each should roll a die, with the highest going first.

Most combats last for multiple Rounds. You only need to determine Initiative at the start of the fight, however. Once the Initiative order has been established, it remains the same from Round to Round. If new combatants join in the midst of the encounter, simply roll Initiative for them and add them to the order.

# **Example**

*The combat has been raging for three Rounds now and one of the cultists has been slain. Alerted by the noise ,a corrupt enforcer arrives to aid the cultists, so the GM rolls Initiative and gets a 7. The enforcer has 25 Agility (giving him an AB of 2), so he goes after Mordechai (Initiative roll of 7 plus Agility Bonus of 2=Initiative of 9). In the new Round, the revised Initiative order is Mordechai (9), enforcer (9), Drake (8), and finally the two remaining cultists (7).*

**"Strike fast and suddenly. Attack without warning. Secure victory before the foe is aware of his danger. Remember always, a war is easily won if your enemy does not know he is fighting."**

# **INITIATIVE** Actions Initiative determines the order in which participants act during **ACTIONS**

During each normal Round, every character gets a Turn to act. On his Turn, a character can take one or more Actions. There are five types of Actions in Dark Heresy.

# **Full Action**

A Full Action requires a character's complete attention to accomplish on his Turn. A character that takes a Full Action cannot take any Half Actions this Round.

# **Half Action**

A Half Action is fairly simple, like moving or drawing a weapon. A character can take two different Half Actions on his Turn instead of taking a Full Action.

Note that you may not take the same Half Action twice.

### **Reactions**

A Reaction is an Action that is made in response to some event such as an attack. All characters receive one Reaction each Round, which may only be used when it is not their Turn. Examples include making a Dodge Test or Parrying an attack.

## **Free Action**

A Free Action takes but a split second and so can be taken in addition to any other Actions you make in a Round. There is no formal limit to the number of Free Actions a character can make in a Round, but a GM should use common sense to set reasonable limits on what can be done in a few seconds.

# **Extended Actions**

Some Actions take more time than a single Round to complete. Once you commit yourself to an Extended Action, you are considered to be working towards completing that Action for as long as it takes. Should you be interrupted or if you abandon the Extended Action, all progress towards completing it is lost.

# **Using Actions**

Typical Actions include drawing a weapon, attacking and moving. During his Turn, a character may perform one Full Action or two different Half Actions. A character could, for example, make a charge attack (Full Action) or aim and shoot (two Half Actions). It's important to remember that a Round is only a few seconds long, so the character's Turn within that Round is but a few moments.

Any Action can be combined with talking, banter, battle cries and other short verbal expressions—these are considered Free Actions. It is left to the GM to decide what a player might be able to say in the time—obviously a terse warning or a wry aside to a comrade would be acceptable. Reciting the complete one-hundred and seventeen rules for the denunciation and chastisement of traitors to the Imperium would not be.

# **Example**

*Vos has rolled an Initiative of 11 this Round. When his Turn comes, he must decide what to do. As he has finally found the Grox he has been tracking, he decides to move up to the beast and then hack at it with his chain axe. Moving and attacking are both Half Actions, so Vos can't do anything more this Round. Once his Actions are resolved, the next combatant in Initiative order (in this case, the rather annoyed Grox, with an Initiative of 10) takes its Turn.*

Most Actions must be completed during your Turn. You can't start a charge attack in one Round and finish it on the next. Some Actions, however, take longer than a single Round to complete. These are known as Extended Actions and they are noted in the following descriptions.

Table 7-5: Combat Actions

A character attempting an Extended Action must continue with that Action until it's finished. He can't start to reload a musket, move and then finish reloading, for example. A character may abort the Action part-way through, but this means that all the time spent on it thus far is wasted.

# **Example**

*Hybris, a Tech-Priest, needs to reload his heavy stubber, which takes two Full Actions. He starts on his next Turn, taking one Full Action. On his following Turn, he finishes reloading by spending another Full Action. If he had chosen to abandon his reloading efforts after the first Round, the Extended Action would have been aborted and he'd have to start the process all over again later, if he still wanted to reload.*

# **Actions**

These Actions provide players with a variety of manoeuvres, giving their characters a range of options in combat. Actions are divided up into Attack Actions, Movement Actions and Miscellaneous Actions.

# **Attack Actions**

Attack Actions are any Action that involves attacking and damaging your opponents.

# **All Out Attack (Full Action)**

You make a furious melee attack, exposing yourself to danger in order to land a forceful blow. You gain a +20 bonus on your Weapon Skill Test, but you may not Parry or Dodge until your next Turn.

# **Charge (Full Action)**

You rush up to an opponent and deliver a single attack. The opponent must be at least 4 metres away from you, but within your Charge Move (see **Table 7-28: Movement (Metres/ Round)** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)**). The last 4 metres of the Charge must be in a straight line, so you can build up speed and line up with your opponent. You gain a +10 bonus to your Weapon Skill Test made at the end of the Charge.

# **Defensive Stance (Full Action)**

You strike no blows this Round as you concentrate on selfdefence. Until your next Turn, all opponents suffer a –20 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack you.

# **Feint (Half Action)**

You pretend to attack in one direction, deceiving your opponent and throwing off his defence. This is resolved by an Opposed Weapon Skill Test. If you win, your next attack cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a Standard Attack, you lose this advantage.

# **Full Auto Burst (Full Action)**

You hurl a burst of fully automatic fire at your opponents. You must be using a weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this Action. (See **Rate of Fire** on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**)

Your vast hail of fire grants a +20 modifier to your Ballistic Skill Test. If the ranged attack is successful, a hit is scored as normal. Furthermore, every degree of success scores an extra hit. The number of extra hits you can score in this manner may not exceed the fully automatic rate of fire for your weapon. Your extra hits can be either allocated to the original target or any other target within 2 metres (provided that the new target would not have been harder to hit). See **Table 7-6 Multiple Hits, page 190** to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Alternatively, as an optional rule, you may roll dice to determine the location of each additional hit, though doing so will slow the game down.

A result of 94 to 00 on your Ballistic Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed (see **Weapon Jams** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

If you have a pistol in either hand you may fire them both (see **Two-Weapon Fighting** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)**).

| Table 7-6: Multiple Hits |      |       |        |       |                        |  |
|--------------------------|------|-------|--------|-------|------------------------|--|
| Location Second          |      | Third | Fourth | Fifth | EachAdditional Hit |  |
| Head                     | Head | Arm   | Body   | Arm   | Body                   |  |
| Arm                      | Arm  | Body  | Head   | Body  | Arm                    |  |
| Body                     | Body | Arm   | Head   | Arm   | Body                   |  |
| Leg                      | Leg  | Body  | Arm    | Head  | Body                   |  |

# **Grapple (Full Action)**

Whether you are Grappling or being Grappled, you may only take the Grapple Action. If Grappling, you may make an Opposed Strength Test to injure your opponent. If you beat your opponent, you deal normal unarmed Damage (1d5–3 plus SB, with armor Points counting double) and one level of Fatigue. If your opponent wins, you deal no Damage, but your opponent is still Grappled.

If you are being Grappled, you may make an Opposed Strength Test to break free or take control of the Grapple. If you win the Test, you escape the Grapple or you begin Grappling your opponent and can now deal Damage on your next Action. See **Grappling** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)** for more information on starting a Grapple.

# **Guarded Attack (Full Action)**

You attack carefully, making sure you are well defended from counter-attacks. You make a melee attack with a –10 penalty to your Weapon Skill Test. Until your next Action, though, you gain a +10 bonus on Dodge or Parry Tests.

# **Knock-Down (Half Action)**

You smash into your opponent in the hopes of knocking him from his feet. You and your opponent make Opposed Strength Tests. If you succeed, you Knock-Down your opponent who falls to the ground and must use the Stand Action to get back to their feet. If you succeed by two or more degrees of success your opponent also takes SB–4 Damage and one level of Fatigue. If your opponent wins, he keeps his footing. If your opponent wins by two or more degrees of success and you fail, you are Knocked-Down instead. If you spent a Half Action to move first, you gain a +10 bonus to your Test.

# **Multiple Attacks (Full Action)**

If you have the Swift Attack or Lightning Attack talents, you may spend a Full Action to make multiple attacks as determined by the Talent you have. Or, if you have a weapon in your secondary hand you may also make an extra attack with this weapon (see **Two-Weapon Fighting** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)**).

# **Overwatch (Varies)**

You guard a particular area, poised to hurl an enormous volley of fire at any opponent foolish enough to approach. You must be using a weapon capable of full automatic fire to take this Action (see **Rate of Fire** on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**). Overwatch is an Extended Action, which may operate over multiple Rounds of combat.

Pick an area to watch. The size of this area, known as your kill zone, extends 45 degrees out from the direction you are facing up to half the Range of the weapon. It is often easier to say that you are covering a specific area such as a corridor, doorway or section of treeline. If there is any doubt, the GM has final say on whether a target is in your kill zone or not.

Establishing your kill zone takes a Full Turn.

Once your kill zone is established, you may spend subsequent Turns waiting for targets to enter your kill zone.

Whilst lying in wait, at any time before your next Turn, you may take the Full Auto Burst Action to fire at any targets within your kill zone (see **Full Auto Burst** on **[page 190](#page-190-0)**). Additionally, when you use your reserved Full Auto Burst, characters within the kill zone must make a Hard (–20) Pinning Test (see **Pinning** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**). If this Action occurs at the same time as another character's, the character with the higher Agility Bonus acts first. If both characters have the same Agility Bonus, you must make an Opposed Agility Test to see who acts first.

You may continue Overwatch for up to your Willpower Bonus in hours. After this time you must rest and refresh yourself for 1d10×10 minutes. Once you have used your Full Auto Burst Action, Overwatch ends. You may opt to end Overwatch during your Turn, even if you have not used your reserved shot.

If you take any other Action or Reaction whilst reserving your shot in this manner, Overwatch immediately ends, whether you have used your reserved shot or not. Note that this does not include Free Actions, such as speech.

#### **Semi-Auto Burst (Full Action)**

You hurl a burst of semi-automatic fire at your opponents. You must be using a weapon capable of semi-automatic fire to take this Action (see **Rate of Fire** on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**).

Your increased volume of fire grants a +10 modifier to your Ballistic Skill Test. If the ranged attack is successful, a hit is scored as normal. Furthermore, every two degrees of success scores an extra hit. The number of extra hits you can score in this manner may not exceed the semi-automatic rate of fire for your weapon. Your extra hits can be either allocated to the original target or to any other target within two metres (provided the new target would not have been harder to hit). See **Table 7-6: Multiple Hits, [page 190](#page-190-0)** to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Alternatively, as an optional rule, you may roll dice to determine the location of each additional hit, though doing so will slow the game down.

A result of 94–00 on your Ballistic Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed (see **Weapon Jams** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

If you have a pistol in either hand you may fire them both (see **Two-Weapon Fighting** on **[page 197](#page-197-0)**).

### **Standard Attack (Half Action)**

You can make one melee or ranged attack by Testing Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill. Certain weapons require Talents to use them effectively (see **Chapter IV: Talents**). You can still make attacks with these weapons if you lack the proper Talents, but you do so with a –20 penalty to your Weapon Skill for melee weapons or Ballistic Skill for ranged weapons.

### **Stun (Full Action)**

When unarmed or armed with a melee weapon, you can strike to Stun rather than attempt to land a killing blow. Whilst any character may attempt this Action, only characters with the Takedown talent stand a good chance of succeeding. Striking to Stun is resolved in a similar way to making a Standard Attack. Test Weapon Skill. If you don't have Takedown, take a –20 penalty to the Test. On a success, roll 1d10 and add your Strength Bonus. Your opponent rolls 1d10 and adds his Toughness Bonus +1 per armor Point protecting his head. If your roll is equal to or higher, your opponent is Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to the difference between the rolls and gains one level of Fatigue.

#### **Suppressing Fire (Full Action)**

You unleash a devastating hail of firepower to force your opponents into cover. You must be using a weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this Action (see **Rate of Fire**  on **[page 127](#page-127-0)**).

Pick an area to suppress. The size of this area, known as your kill zone, extends 45 degrees out from the direction you are facing up to half the range of the weapon. It is often easier to say you are covering a specific area such as a corridor, doorway or section of treeline. If there is any doubt, the GM has final say on whether a target is in your kill zone or not. Targets within this area must make a Hard (–20) Pinning Test (see **Pinning** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

Additionally, you must make a Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill Test to see if your wild spray of fire has hit anyone, friend or foe, within the kill zone. If the ranged attack is successful, the GM assigns the hit to a random target within the kill zone. Furthermore, every two degrees of success scores an extra hit against another random victim. Use of the Suppressing Fire Action does not affect the defensive benefits of armor or cover. The number of hits scored may not exceed the fully automatic rate of fire for your weapon. See **Table 7-6: Multiple Hits, [page 190](#page-190-0)** to determine the Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target. Alternatively, as an optional rule, you may roll dice to determine the location of each additional hit, though doing so will slow the game down.

A result of 94 to 00 on your Ballistics Skill Test indicates that your weapon has Jammed (see **Weapon Jams** on **[page 196](#page-196-0)**).

# **Combat Abstractions**

Combat in Dark Heresy is fast and furious, designed so your games don't become bogged down with minutia. As such, the rules take certain licences with reality and assumptions must be made about what is really going on during a combat. Generally speaking, when two characters are engaged, they are exchanging attacks, Parries, Dodges, Feints and a number of other manoeuvres, all of which are rolled into the Standard Attack. Therefore, a Test against Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill assumes that the defender is attempting to defend himself to some degree—hence a typical Attack Test is Challenging (+0). A failed Test means that the defender was too difficult to hit effectively, whilst a successful Test means that the attacker was able to strike a telling blow. Where Dodge and Parry come into play, they represent your last line of defence against an attacker, giving you one more chance to avoid a bullet or the swing of a chainsword.

# **Move Actions**

Move Actions let you manoeuvre on the battlefield.

# **Disengage (Full Action)**

You break off from melee combat and may move up to your Half Move rate. Opponents whom you were engaged with do not gain the customary free attacks. See **Fleeing sidebar** for more details.

# **Fleeing**

Sometimes it is just best to get away from your opponent by any means you can. In combat, you may voluntarily flee from an opponent or be forced to flee because of Fear, a Psychic Power or some other effect. When fleeing under your own control, you can take any of the following actions: Disengage, Move or Run. When fleeing against your will, you must take the Run action. Under most circumstances (except for Disengaging), you're turning your back on your opponent and leaving yourself open for an attack. If you are trying to move away from one or more melee opponents without using the Disengage Action, each opponent gets a free attack against you as you move away. This is an extra attack and is made in addition to any other attacks they make during their Turn.

# **Jump/Leap (Full Action)**

You can Jump up or down, or Leap across something. For **Jumping and Leaping**, see **[page 214](#page-214-0)**.

# **Manoeuvre (Half Action)**

By using superior footwork and aggression, you can force your opponent to move one metre in a direction of your choosing by making an Opposed Weapon Skill Test. If desired, you can advance one metre as well. The opponent cannot be forced into another character or some other obstacle (wall, barrel, and so on).

# **Move (Half or Full Action)**

You can make a short move. If you spend a Half Action to move, you may move up to that described on **Table 7-28: Movement in Metres/Round** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)**. If you use a Full Action, you may move twice this value. Whenever you end your movement adjacent to an adversary, you are said to be engaged with that opponent.

# **Run (Full Action)**

You run at full speed (see **Table 7-28: Movement in Metres/ Round** on **[page 212](#page-212-0)** for distances). This makes you harder to hit with missile weapons, but easy prey for melee attacks because you are not actively defending. Until your next Turn, ranged attacks made against you take a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests, but melee attacks gain a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests.

# **Stand/Mount (Half Action)**

You can get up if currently on the ground, or mount a riding beast or a vehicle.

**Tactical Advance (Full Action)**

You can move up to your Full Move rate provided that you move from a position of cover and end your movement in a position of cover. For the duration of your move, you are considered to benefit from cover, even though you are moving in the open for a brief time.

# **Miscellaneous Actions**

Miscellaneous Actions encompass everything else you might wish to do in combat.

# **Aim (Half or Full Action)**

You may take extra time to set up a melee or ranged attack to increase the chance to hit. If you spend a Half Action to aim, your next attack is made at a +10 to your Weapon Skill (for melee attacks) or Ballistic Skill (for ranged attacks). If you spend a Full Action Aiming, the bonus increases to +20. The attack must follow immediately otherwise the benefits of Aiming are lost.

# **Delay (Half Action)**

You watch and wait for an opportunity. When you use the delay Action, your Turn ends immediately, but you reserve a Half Action for later use. Any time before your next Turn, you can take your reserved Half Action. If you try to do something at the same time as another character that used a delay Action, you must make an Opposed Agility Test to see who acts first. If the prepared Action is not taken before your next Turn, it is lost. **Dodge**

Dodge is a Basic Skill, so anyone may attempt it even without training. Once a hit is scored, but before Damage is rolled, you can try to Dodge if you were aware of the attack. This is simply a Dodge Test. If the Dodge Test succeeds, you get out of the way at the last minute and the attack is considered to have missed (and thus there is no Damage roll). If you fail the Test, the attack connects and your opponent may roll for Damage as usual. You may Dodge both melee and ranged attacks.

# **Dodging Auto-Fire and Area Effect Attacks**

# **Example**

*It seems that the barman has taken exception to Drake's treatment of his paying customers and on his Initiative, starts combat by charging the Guardsman with a shock maul. The barman makes a Weapon Skill Test and hits. Drake can Test Dodge to get out of the way. He rolls the dice and compares the result to his Agility. He succeeds and manages to duck beneath the arc of the shock maul.*

Some attacks are more difficult to Dodge either because they cover a large area, like a grenade or flamer, or because they throw out large amounts of rounds, like a weapon fired on Full or Semi-Automatic Bursts.

When Dodging an area effect weapon, a successful Dodge Test will move the character to the edge of the area of effect, as long as it is no further away than their Agility Bonus in metres. If they would need to move further than this to avoid the attack then the Dodge Test automatically fails.

When Dodging Full or Semi-Automatic fire, each degree of success negates an additional hit. **Focus Power (Varies)**

# **Example**

*Father Horst is surprised by a mutant trooper with an autogun sneaking into the far end of his chapel-trench. The mutant has the drop on Father Horst, and so gets a Full Turn to act before Father Horst can do anything.*

*The debased-looking trooper uses his Turn to spray a Full Auto Burst (a Full Action) at Father Horst. The mutant gains +20 to his Ballistic Skill of 30 because of the sheer number of slugs his autogun is hurling. The mutant scores a 19 on his Test—a hit! As he has three degrees of success (50–19=31) the trooper has managed to score one additional hit.*

*Being a sensible soul, Father Horst decides use his Reaction to try and Dodge the Full Auto Burst. Father Horst Tests against his Agility of 40, and scores a 17. As this grants two degrees of success (40–17=23) Father Horst can escape two of the mutant's hits. Somehow, Father Horst has avoided all Damage—a miracle!*

This Action is used to manifest your Psychic Powers in combat. How long the Focus Power Action takes is dependant on the power being manifested. When you take this Action you roll a number of dice and add a bonus dependant on your Psy Rating. Then compare the total to the Psychic Threshold (PT). If this number equals or exceeds the PT, the power takes effect. Otherwise, it has failed and you may try again next Turn. For more information on Psychic Powers, see **Chapter VI: Psychic Powers**.

### **Parry**

You can attempt to Parry a successful attack if you are wielding a drawn melee weapon (see **Chapter V: armory**) and are aware of the attack. To Parry, Test Weapon Skill. If you succeed, you beat back the attack and it is considered to have missed (thus, there's no Damage roll). If you fail the Test, the attack connects and your opponent may roll for Damage as usual. Parrying requires no special Skill or Talent to attempt.

You may only use Parry to negate melee attacks.

## **Ready (Half Action)**

You can draw a weapon or retrieve an object stowed in a pouch or pocket. You can also put an item away that you are currently holding. So, you could holster a pistol and unsheathe a knife as one Half Action. You can also use this Action to do such things as apply a medi-patch, inject stimm or some other kind of drug, or coat a weapon with the contents of a vial of poison, for example. You may use the Ready Action twice in one Turn if you are preparing two different items.

## **Reload (Varies)**

You can reload a missile weapon. See **Chapter V: armory** for the time it takes to reload different missile weapons. Reload can be an Extended Action.

### **Use a Skill (Varies)**

You may use a Skill. This usually involves making a Skill Test. This can be an Extended Action, depending on the Skill and the circumstances.

# **Example**

*Vos is still battling the ill-tempered Grox. He has scored an Initiative of 7 while the Grox has an Initiative of 4, meaning Vos goes first. In his turn he spends a Half Action to Aim with his chain axe and then his remaining Half Action to attack. Unfortunately, Vos misses, despite the bonus for Aiming.* 

*It is now the Grox's Turn. Angered by the large hairy creature trying to kill it, the Grox uses a Full Action to make an All-Out Attack, though fortunately for Vos it also misses. As a Free Action the Grox lets out a whining bray calling for help from the herd. Since there are no more combatants, the Round ends.*

*As the new Round begins, a Bull-Grox appears from the forest in answer to its fellow's cry for aid. The GM rolls Initiative for the new combatant and determines that the Bull-Grox can act before Vos. The Bull-Grox Charges (a Full Action) and hits the feral warrior inflicting a nasty wound. Now it is Vos' Turn again. Wisely, he decides that two Grox is a Grox too many and beats a hasty retreat using a Disengage Action.*

If a player wants to do something not covered by the Actions described here, the GM should make a judgement about how long something might take and what type of Action it would be. Generally, most Actions should be resolved with some sort of Test: Characteristic Test, Skill Test or Opposed Test. Keep in mind that a Round is only a few seconds long, which is a very limited amount of time to accomplish a task.

# **The Tactical Map**

The Dark Heresy rules are written so you can use a tactical map and 28mm miniatures whilst playing out combat. This approach adds a visual element to the game and allows you to instantly understand the relative positions of all the combatants. You can find maps that are blank and can be written on with wet-erase pens. These allow you to sketch out the terrain and other important features on the map before combat begins. Wet-erase maps also make it easy to track the duration of Psychic Powers, reload times, and the like since you can scribble notes on the map. A tactical map is overlaid with a grid of one-inch squares to make measuring distances easier. In Dark Heresy, these squares represent a distance of one metre.

To make fullest use of the tactical map, you'll need miniatures. You'll want one for each PC, and the GM should try to collect a fair number of the most common foes (gangers, cultists, mutants and so on). If you don't have any miniatures, there are all sorts of things you can substitute, like counters, coins, or stones. Humans, mutants and other similarly sized creatures occupy a single square on the map. Larger creatures can take up 2, 4, or even more squares.

If you don't like tactical maps, but still want to use miniatures, the rules can easily accommodate this. Simply use a tape measure and each inch of distance equals one metre. This makes movement more flexible and has the advantage of allowing the easy use of three-dimensional terrain.

Some gamers don't like to use miniatures at all, preferring to imagine all the action. This is okay too. This method requires the GM to keep a snapshot of the action and the relative positions of all the combatants in his head, but it also allows for greater narrative freedom in describing encounters.

# **Other Actions** **THE ATTACK**

The most common Action in combat is the attack—you are fighting, after all. Whether armed with a melee or ranged weapon, the process is the same. Follow these steps to resolve attacks in combat.

# **Step One: Test**

To make a melee attack with a hand-held weapon, you must be engaged with your target. Test Weapon Skill. When making a ranged attack, you Test Ballistic Skill. Both of these are like any other Tests. If you roll equal to or below your Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill, you hit your opponent.

# **Step Two: Determine Hit Location**

On a successful hit, you next need to determine where the hit landed. Using the Test result, reverse the order of the dice, (e.g. a roll of 32 becomes 23, 19 becomes 91, and so on) and compare this number to **Table 7-7: Hit Locations**. Note that certain creatures with different body shapes, or mounted opponents, may use different hit location tables.

| Table 7-7: Hit Locations |           |  |  |
|--------------------------|-----------|--|--|
| Roll                     | Location  |  |  |
| 01–10                    | Head      |  |  |
| 11–20                    | Right Arm |  |  |
| 21–30                    | Left Arm  |  |  |
| 31–70                    | Body      |  |  |
| 71–85                    | Right Leg |  |  |
| 86–00                    | Left Leg  |  |  |

# **Example**

*Pieter (BS35) shoots at the oncoming ganger, rolling 13—a hit! Reversing the number rolled gives 31, the ganger has been shot in the body.*

# **Step Three: Determine Damage**

Once you've determined the Hit Location, it is time to work out any Damage you have dealt. Each weapon has a Damage listing. This is usually a die roll, plus or minus a number. Roll the appropriate die, and add the Damage Bonus of the weapon. Finally, if you are using a melee weapon, add your Strength Bonus.

This is the Damage total. If you roll a "10" on any of your Damage dice, you have a chance of Righteous Fury! (see **sidebar**).

# **Step Four: Apply Damage**

From the Damage total, your opponent subtracts his Toughness Bonus and any armor Points that protect the location that is hit. If this reduces the Damage total to 0 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the attack. Any remaining Damage is recorded on his character sheet as Damage. Should this injury equal or exceed his Wounds, he notes any excess as Critical Damage and <span id="page-195-0"></span>the GM consults the appropriate table based on the weapon used and the amount of Critical Damage accumulated. See **Critical Damage** on **[page 201](#page-201-0)** for more information.

# **Example**

*Drake has a Ballistic Skill of 42 and uses his triplex-pattern lasgun to shoot a gambler foolish enough to accuse him of cheating. He rolls a 27. Since this is less than his Ballistic Skill, he has scored a hit. Next, he reverses the dice rolled to see where he hits, which is a 72—the Right Leg. Now he rolls Damage. He is using a lasgun, which does 1d10+3 Damage. He rolls 1d10 and gets an 8, for a total of 11 (8+3=11). The gambler has a Toughness Bonus of 3 and is wearing a concealed quilted vest. Since the armor does not cover the legs, the gambler can only use his Toughness Bonus to reduce the Damage. The gambler takes 8 Wounds (11–3=8), hopefully discouraging him from making any rash accusations in future.*

# **Righteous Fury!**

Normally, when you hit with an attack, the resulting Damage includes rolling one or more d10s. When you roll a 10 on any die (this includes a result of 10 when using a d5—even though the number is halved), it may indicate that the eye of the Emperor is upon you. This calls for a second attack roll, Testing Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill as if you were making another attack. If this second Test is successful, the spirit of the Emperor is within you, aiding your attack and guiding your aim. You can roll an additional 1d10 and add the result to the Damage total.

Should the result of this die also be a 10, the Emperor has indeed smiled upon you. You may immediately roll a third 1d10 and add that to the Damage total as well. This process continues until you roll a number other than 10.

*Not content to let things lie, the gambler has charged Drake with a knife. The Veteran Guardsman responds by smashing him across the face with the butt of his lasgun. Drake rolls for Damage, and scores a 10! He has a chance of dealing extra Damage. He makes a second attack roll and succeeds again. He rolls another d10 and once again gets a 10. Rather than make another Weapon Skill Test, Drake just rolls another d10. This time it comes up 8. The Damage total for this attack is 4 (Drake's SB) + 10 +10 + 8, for a total of 32 Damage. It doesn't look like the gambler will be getting up anytime soon.*

*Normally NPCs do not benefit from the Righteous Fury rule, however, at the GM's discretion particularly important or powerful NPCs might take advantage of this rule.*

# **Dealing Damage**

Any attack, Psychic Power or hazard that deals Damage generally indicates the amount of Damage with a die type, and Damage modifier. For example, a lasgun's Damage is 1d10+3. This means that in order to discover the injury caused by the weapon, you roll one d10 and add 3 to the result. This gives your Damage total. In some cases, the modifier will subtract from the Damage you have rolled.

#### **When dealing Damage with a melee attack, your Strength Bonus also comes into play.**

To calculate Damage done with a hand-to-hand weapon, such as a chainsword, hammer or spear, you calculate the Damage as normal and then add your Strength Bonus.

# **Example**

*Father Horst is fighting in a mud-filled trench on a Throneforsaken battlefield. A crazed Chaos worshipper moves in to attack Horst, and misses. Hefting his blessed hammer, Horst swings at the degenerate scum. Success! His attack hits. The Damage of Horst's hammer is 1d10+1. Horst rolls a 6 on his Damage die, and then adds the Damage modifier of 1. Finally, Horst adds his Strength Bonus of 2 (his Strength is 29). In total, Horst has dealt 9 points of Damage (6+1+2=9).*

Whether your Damage total can be reduced depends on the nature of the attack, but Damage is typically reduced by the target's Toughness Bonus and armor Points that protect the location struck.

# **Ranged Attacks**

Ranged attacks—lasguns, scatterguns, thrown weapons, etc.—are resolved in the same way as melee attacks, except that you Test Ballistic Skill instead of Weapon Skill. In addition, there are a few extra considerations that apply to these attacks.

- Ranged attacks cannot be Parried, unless you have a special Talent.
- You do not add your Strength Bonus to the Damage of ranged attacks.
- You cannot make ranged attacks whilst engaged in melee, unless you are armed with a ranged weapon that is classed as a pistol.
- You must be able to see the target. You may still attack targets that are partly visible, such as those standing behind a tree or behind other targets, but they will often be in cover. If you are aware of an opponent that is completely concealed from you by a barrier, you can attempt the shot, but at a –30 penalty and the shot must deal enough Damage to breach the barrier. When shooting at unseen targets you also gain no bonuses for range.

### **Shooting into Melee**

There will be times when a target is already engaged with another enemy. Ballistic Skill Tests against these opponents are harder than normal. You can still make a ranged attack at an opponent engaged in melee, but you take a –20 penalty to the Test.

**Optional Rule:** GMs keen on reinforcing the merciless nature of the 41st Millennium may rule that if you would have hit the target were it not for the penalty, you instead hit the target's opponent. The GM might also rule that anyone shooting into melee with a semi-automatic or full automatic weapon must allocate at least one of their hits against the target's opponent.

### **Missing**

Sometimes, when flinging a thrown weapon, it's important to know where the weapon lands should you fail on your Ballistic Skill Test. On a failed roll, the GM rolls 1d10 and consults the following **Scatter Diagram**. Roll 1d5 to determine the number of metres the weapon travels in the indicated direction.

### **Pinning**

Being shot at is a terrifying experience at the best of times and even the most inexperienced Acolytes know to keep their heads down when the bullets and bolt shells start flying. Pinning represents a character's survival instincts telling him to stay in cover. While he may want to charge headlong into a storm of bullets, he first needs to steel his nerves. When a character is on the receiving end of suppressive fire, even if the shot struck a Hit Location that is behind cover or the character suffers no Damage, he must make a Hard (–20 ) Pinning Test. This is a Willpower Test. On a success, the character may act normally. On a failure, the character becomes Pinned.

#### **Being Pinned**

A Pinned character may only take Half Actions. Additionally, he must take a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests if he fires, snapping off shots while being mindful of their own safety. If a Pinned character is in cover relative to the attacker that Pinned them, he may not leave it except to retreat (provided that he can remain in cover while doing so). If he is not in cover when Pinned he must use his next Turn to reach cover. If there is no cover nearby, he must move away from the attacker that Pinned him. A character can Test Willpower at the end of his Turn to escape Pinning, in which case he may act as normal in his next Turn. This Test is Easy (+30) if the character is no longer under fire (i.e. no one tried to shoot him since his last Turn). A character engaged in close combat automatically escapes Pinning. There are some special Talents, Skills and Psychic Powers that can also free a character from the effects of Pinning—as well as such things as combat drugs and terrifying commissars.

# **Example**

*Vos is being pursued by the Grox. Fortunately for him he has found the burnt-out remains of an Arbites APC to shelter in, complete with intact pintle-mounted heavy stubber. Aiming the powerful machine gun in the direction of the Grox, Vos decides that rather than firing a full auto burst, he will lay down Suppressive Fire. He chooses a narrow gully nearby as his kill zone, as this is where the Grox are emerging from.* 

*Each of the three Grox in the kill zone must make a Hard (–20) Pinning Test to ignore the terrifying effects of Vos' Suppressing Fire. Each fails, meaning that the Grox will be forced to use their Turn to fall back into cover. Vos makes a Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill Test to see if his volley has struck any of the Grox. He scores a 55, which means that none of his bullets hit.*

*On the Grox's turn, each flees into the cover of the gully. Each then Tests Willpower to see if they feel brave enough to risk the hail of bullets once more. Two succeed and one fails.*

 *Seeing that the heavy stubber's ammo belt is empty, Vos uses his turn to run away as fast as possible.* 

*The two Grox who managed to escape Pinning are free to use their turn to chase Vos. The Grox which failed to escape Pinning, meanwhile, is forced to remain in cover, emptying its bowels and snorting nervously to itself. As it is no longer under fire from the heavy stubber, at the end of its turn the cowardly Grox makes an Easy (+30) Willpower Test to escape Pinning. The Grox succeeds, meaning that on its subsequent Turn, it may break from cover and rejoin the chase.*

## **Weapon Jams**

Such is the capricious whim of the 41st Millennium that many of the ranged weapons that an Acolyte uses will have an unfortunate tendency to malfunction, either through extreme age, maltreatment of their machine spirit, or just plain poor design. To represent these unfortunate occurrences, an unmodified result of 96 to 00, in addition to being an automatic miss, also indicates the weapon has jammed. A Jammed weapon cannot be fired until it is cleared. Clearing a Jam is a Full Action which requires a Ballistic Skill Test. If the Test is successful then the Jam has been cleared, though the weapon needs to be reloaded and any ammo in it is lost. If the Test is failed the weapon is still Jammed, though the character can attempt to clear it again next Round.

**Note:** Some weapons, such as plasma guns, grenades and missiles, are particularly dangerous to use. For these weapons refer to their descriptions and Weapon Special Qualities (see **Chapter V: armory**). Semi-automatic and fully automatic fire also increases the likelihood of Jamming. This is described within the Semi-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst and Suppressing Fire Actions.

### **Two-Weapon Fighting**

Many warriors fight with a weapon in either hand (this includes shields). There are advantages and disadvantages to this style of fighting. While it offers some improved opportunities to make attacks, it reduces the chances of successfully striking a target. The following apply when you are fighting with two weapons:

- You may use any close combat weapons or ranged weapons that you may reasonably use in one hand when fighting with two weapons.
- You may use either hand to make an attack. Attacks made using your secondary hand take a –20 penalty.
- If you have the Two-Weapon Wielder talent, you may spend a Full Action to attack with both weapons, but each takes a –20 penalty to the Test. If you have the Ambidextrous talent, this penalty drops to –10.
- If you're wielding a melee weapon as one of your two weapons you may make a Parry once each Round as a Reaction as normal with this weapon, though you still may not Parry more than once in a Round. This Weapon Skill Test is not an attack, and therefore it does suffer the standard penalty for attacks made using your secondary hand.
- If armed with a melee weapon in one hand and a pistol in the other, you may, with the Two-Weapon Wielder talent use both in close combat. Resolve each attack separately by Testing Weapon Skill for the melee weapon and Ballistic Skill for the pistol. Using both attacks simultaneously is a Full Action and is subject to the usual penalties.
- When firing a ranged weapon with each hand, you may fire each weapon on a different mode, for example, one on full automatic and one on semi-automatic. When firing a full automatic weapon in each hand, you may only lay down one area of suppressive fire.
- You may fire your weapons at different targets, though they must be within 10 metres of each other.

# **Unarmed Combat**

Not every fight in Dark Heresy requires bolters and power swords. Some conflicts can be settled the oldfashioned way with fists (not to mention feet and, if you're a dirty scummer, teeth). A successful Weapon Skill Test made with an unarmed attack deals 1d5–3 Impact Damage, plus the character's Strength Bonus. armor Points count as double against the attack. In addition, a successful hit also causes one level of Fatigue.

During unarmed combat, if you roll a 10 on a die for Damage the rules for Righteous Fury apply (see **[page 195](#page-195-0)**) with 10s counting as 5s in terms of Damage caused.

# **Grappling**

Instead of inflicting Damage with an unarmed attack, you can attempt to Grapple and immobilise your opponent. You can attempt a Grapple with either a Charge or a Standard Attack. Resolve a Grapple by following these steps.

### **Step One: Make the Attack**

Make an unarmed attack by Testing Weapon Skill as normal.

### **Step Two: Avoid the Attack**

If you succeed, your opponent may use their Reaction to make an Agility Test. If this Test fails, or they have already used their Reaction this Round, the opponent is Grappled. If he succeeds, the Grapple attempt fails.

### **Step Three: Grapple!**

While two or more characters are Grappling, the following effects apply.

- Participants in a Grapple may not Dodge or Parry.
- Other attackers gain a +20 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests made to hit a Grappling target.
- Grappled characters may only take the Grapple Action (see **Grapple Action** on **[page 190](#page-190-0)**).
- As a Free Action, you can voluntarily end the Grapple that you initiated on your Turn.

# **Combining Difficulties**

There will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more difficult than normal. For example, while in a shadowy hanger bay, trying to shoot at an opponent at long range is harder that shooting at the same opponent if the hanger was brightly lit. To combine multiple factors, use the following guidelines:

- •If the situationwould apply two or more penalties,simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of –60. For example, fog and Aiming for a specific body part each make Ballistic Skill Tests –20 (Hard). When combined, the test would be –40.
- If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new Difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a Very Hard (–30) Test. But attacking an opponent who is Stunned requires a Routine (+20) Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be Difficult (–10) since –30 plus +20 equals –10.
- If the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60. Two characters that attack the same Stunned opponent would ordinarily gain a +10 bonus for ganging up and a +20 bonus for attacking a Stunned target. Thus the need to make Easy (+30) Weapon Skill Tests to hit their opponent.

When adjudicating Difficulty, common sense should prevail. No matter what limit there is on Test penalties, some shots are simply impossible.

# **Combat Circumstances**

The chances of hitting in combat can be modified in a similar manner to Skill Tests. These combat circumstances can be used to reflect the effects of terrain, the weather, tactical situations and a variety of other factors. Characters should make as much use of beneficial circumstances as possible. A good plan, suitable equipment or skilful use of tactics can often make the difference between life and death for an Acolyte. The following circumstances are some of the most common ones encountered in combat. For situations not covered here, use these as a guide. Remember, the GM has the final say about the Difficulty of any particular Test.

# **Called Shots**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit a specific location are Hard (–20). Note you cannot make Called Shots when firing a weapon on semi-automatic or full automatic fire.

## **Darkness**

Weapon Skill Tests made in darkness are regarded as Hard (–20), while Ballistic Skill Tests are regarded as Very Hard (–30).

# **Difficult Terrain**

Weapon Skill and Dodge Tests made whilst standing in difficult terrain such as mud are Difficult (–10). Tests made whilst standing in arduous terrain such as deep snow or upon ice are Very Hard (–30).

# **Extreme Range**

Targets that are at a distance of three times the range of a character's weapon, are at Extreme range. Rolls to hit these targets with a ranged weapon are Very Hard (–30).

# **Fatigued**

When a character is Fatigued all their Tests, including any Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests, suffer a –10 penalty.

# **Firing a Weapon on Semi-Automatic**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit targets when firing a weapon on Semi-Automatic are Ordinary (+10).

## **Firing a Weapon on Full Automatic**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit targets when firing a weapon on Full Automatic are Routine (+20).

## **Fog, Mist or Shadow**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets concealed by fog, mist or shadow are Hard (–20).

## **Ganging Up**

You have an advantage when you and your allies engage the same foe in melee combat. If you outnumber your opponent two to one, your Weapon Skill Tests are Ordinary (+10). If you outnumber your opponent by three to one or more, your Weapon Skill Tests are Routine (+20).

## **Helpless Targets**

Weapon Skill Tests made to hit a sleeping, unconscious or otherwise helpless target automatically succeed. When rolling Damage against such a target roll two dice and add the results. If either die rolled comes up as a 10, you have a chance at Righteous Fury. If both dice come up as 10, you automatically gain Righteous Fury, and roll Damage again.

# **Higher Ground**

Characters standing on higher ground—such as standing on a table, fighting from the top of a mound of dead comrades, on top of a hill, and so on—have a combat advantage. Weapon Skill Tests made by these characters are Ordinary (+10).

# **Long Range**

Targets that are at a distance of more than double the range of a character's weapon, are at long range. Rolls to hit these targets with a ranged weapon are Difficult (–10).

# **Point Blank**

Rolls to hit a target within three metres with a ranged weapon are Easy (+30). Note that this bonus does not apply when shooting targets that are in close combat with the character.

# **Prone**

Targets that have been Knocked Down are easier to hit and they find it harder to hit other foes. Weapon Skill Tests made to attack Prone targets are Ordinary (+10). Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made by Prone targets are Difficult (–10). Dodge Tests made whilst Prone are Hard (–20).

# **Off Hand Attacks**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack foes whilst you're using a weapon in your off hand are considered Hard (–20).

# **Short Range**

Targets that are at a distance of less than half the Range of a character's weapon are at Short range. Rolls to hit these targets with a ranged weapon are Ordinary (+10).

# **Shooting into Melee Combat**

Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit a target in melee combat with an opponent are Hard (–20).

# **Size**

Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a Land Raider than a grav-bike for instance. Use **Table 7-9: Size Modifiers** for working out bonuses and penalties based on size.

# **Stunned Targets**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack Stunned targets are Routine (+20).

|  | Table 7-9: Size Modifiers |  |
|--|---------------------------|--|
|  |                           |  |

| Size                                    | Modifier |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|
| Minuscule (Door handle, knife)          | –30      |
| Puny (Rat, servo-skull)                 | –20      |
| Scrawny (Child, ash slug)               | –10      |
| Average (Human, mutant)                 | 0        |
| Hulking (Grox, combat servitor)         | +10      |
| Enormous (Silt spider, Land speeder)    | +20      |
| Massive (Battle tank, scar wyrm)+30 |          |

# **Unaware Targets**

Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack unaware targets (i.e. Surprised targets), are Easy (+30).

# **Unarmed**

When making an unarmed attack against an armed opponent, your Weapon Skill Test is Hard (–20).

# **Weather and Unnatural Conditions**

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack whilst enduring harsh weather or unnatural conditions, such as standing in heavy rain, an ash storm or knee-deep in waves of fungus are considered Hard (-20).

# **Cover**

Cover is a vital part of surviving a firefight and a good Acolyte knows that you go for your cover first and then draw your gun. There are no penalties to Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack targets standing partly behind cover. However, there is a chance that the shot may hit the cover rather than the target. It is up to the player to decide which parts of his body he is exposing when behind cover. Unless the Acolyte is attempting a rather crude form of psychological warfare, as a rule of thumb, a character firing around or over cover will have his body and legs concealed. If the shot would hit a body location that is concealed behind cover, work out the Damage against the armor Points of the cover instead, with any excess being applied to the target as normal (see **Table 7-10: Cover Types** for a guide to the armor Points of different kinds of cover).

# **Damaging Cover**

Cover is not invulnerable. Attacks can Damage or destroy the protection afforded by cover. Each successful hit against cover that deals Damage in excess of the armor Points it provides will reduce the cover's armor Points by 1. For example, a bolter shot that penetrates a light wooden door would reduce the door's AP to 3.

| Table 7-10: Cover Types              |    |  |
|--------------------------------------|----|--|
| Cover Type                           | AP |  |
| Light Wood, armor-glas, Light Metal | 4  |  |
| Heavy Wood, Flakboard, Sandbags, Ice | 8  |  |
| Rockcrete, Thick Iron, Stone16   |    |  |
| Plasteel, Armaplas                   | 32 |  |

# Inj ury INJURY

*"Better crippled in body than corrupt in mind."* — *Lexiconum Moralis*.

A As a consequence of fighting, characters take Damage. A combatant can take Damage up to an amount equal to his Wounds. When the Damage equals the character's Wounds, he is a bloodied mess barely clinging to consciousness. Further blows become Critical Damage, resulting in such things as permanent disability, the loss of limbs and of course, death.

# Fatig ue **FATIGUE**

Not all Damage is lethal in Dark Heresy. Exhaustion, combat trauma or swapping licks with bare fists can all leave a character battered, but more or less intact. Fatigue measures the amount of non-lethal Damage a character can take over the course of game play. Characters gain Fatigue from certain types of attacks, Grappling, forced marching and other Actions which push them beyond safe limits. A character can take a number of levels of Fatigue equal to his Toughness Bonus, so a character with a four Toughness Bonus can take four levels of Fatigue. Should a character take a number of levels of Fatigue in excess of his Toughness Bonus, he collapses, unconscious for 10–TB minutes.

Characters suffering from Fatigue are at a –10 penalty to all Tests.

# **Example**

*Drake has been on a forced march for several hours, causing him to take two levels of Fatigue. Finally, he arrives at the settlement of Stern Hope, and makes his way to the local dive for a cold flagon of spitbrew. Whilst quaffing the (slightly chunky) ale, he manages to get on the wrong side of Slippery Zim, a local gangster. Zim takes a swing at him with a bottle. Drake is forced to Dodge out of the way. He makes a Dodge Skill Test, and rolls 30. As Drake's Agility is 34, this would normally be a success. However, as Drake is Fatigued he would need to roll 24 or less to successfully Dodge (34–10 = 24). Too tired to leap out of the way properly, Drake gets the bottle smashed into his skull.*

## **Removing Fatigue**

If left alone, Fatigue goes away in time. Each hour of rest which includes no combat, no Psychic Powers and nothing strenuous, removes one level of Fatigue. Eight consecutive hours of rest remove all levels of Fatigue.

# Be coming Stun n ed **BECOMING STUNNED**

In addition to Wound loss and other sorts of Damage, characters may also become Stunned. A character can become Stunned due to the effects of some Psychic Powers, Critical Hits, or the Takedown talent. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests to hit Stunned characters are considered Routine (+20). In addition, Stunned characters cannot take Actions of any kind, even free ones like Dodge.

# Characteristic Damag e **CHARACTERISTIC DAMAGE**

Some Psychic Powers, poisons, diseases and other hazards circumvent your Wounds and deal Damage directly to your Characteristic. Characteristic loss cannot reduce a Characteristic below 0. Unless otherwise specified, Characteristic Damage is never permanent and you recover lost points at a rate of one each hour. Remember, penalties to Characteristics as well as Characteristic Damage may also affect the Characteristic's bonus. Should the Damage or penalty reduce the tens digit of a Characteristic, the associated bonus also drops by 1.

Consult the following entries for information on what happens if a Characteristic is reduced to 0. Remember when a Characteristic like Strength, Toughness or Agility is reduced, it will also reduce your corresponding Strength Bonus, Toughness Bonus or Agility Bonus.

- **Weapon Skill:** You may not take Tests based on this Characteristic.
- **Ballistic Skill:** You may not take Tests based on this Characteristic.
- **Strength:** You collapse into unconsciousness.

**Toughness:** You die.

- **Agility:** You are paralysed and helpless. Take no Actions.
- **Intelligence:** You slip into a dreamless coma, possibly drooling on yourself in an embarrassing way.
- **Perception:** You are bereft of your senses. Take a –30 penalty to all tests (except Toughness) until you recover.
- **Willpower:** You collapse into a nightmare filled sleep. When you awaken, gain 1 Insanity Point (see **Fear, Terror and Insanity** in **Chapter VIII: The Games Master**).
- **Fellowship:** You withdraw into a catatonic state. You may not speak or take Tests based on this Characteristic.

# **Damage Types**

All Damage is divided up into four types: Energy (lasers, fire, plasma), Explosive (grenades, bolt rounds, missiles), Impact (clubs, bullets, falling) and Rending (swords, chain weapons, claws). What kind of Damage a weapon or effect deals will be noted in its description. Damage types only apply to Critical Hits and serve to determine which Critical Effects table you use when inflicting Critical Hits.

**If it is not specified what type of Damage an attack deals, count it as Impact. If it does not specify what location an attack hits, count it as the Body.**

# **CRITICAL DAMAGE**

Any Damage taken in excess of a character's Wounds counts as Critical Damage. When this occurs, immediately consult the table that corresponds with the location (arm, body, etc.) and the type of attack (Energy, Explosive, Impact or Rending). The Critical Damage total determines the severity of the injury to the location. Should the character survive, the Critical Damage still remains. If the same character takes Damage again, the Critical Damage is added to the existing Damage and the cumulative Damage total is used to determine the new Critical Effect.

# **Example**

*Mordechai takes a nasty hit from a ganger's axe, taking 10 points of Damage. Mordechai has only 10 Wounds, so he's probably in trouble. On the next Round, the filthy ganger hits him again, dealing another 3 points of Damage (after reducing the Damage total by Mordechai's TB and armor Points) to the head. These three points exceed Mordechai's Wounds, so they count as Critical Damage. The GM looks at the Critical Rending–Head table, looks at the third row and announces the result. Mordechai loses one eye, is Stunned, and takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The GM rolls for Fatigue, getting a 3. Luckily, Mordechai's Toughness Bonus is 5, so he can take two more levels of Fatigue before falling unconscious.*

*On Mordechai's next Turn, he spends a Fate Point to recover from being Stunned, then attacks feebly, noting that he's at a –10 penalty for his Fatigue, and misses. The ganger, sensing the end is near, lashes out with his axe and hits Mordechai again, this time dealing 5 points of Damage (after TB and AP) to the body. Mordechai adds 5 Critical Damage to the 3 he's already accumulated for a total of 8. Looking at the Critical table, this time for the body, the GM reads the "8" result, "With a vile tearing noise, the skin on your chest comes away revealing a red ruin of muscle. You must make a Toughness Test or die. If you pass, you permanently lose 1d10 from your Toughness, take 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and now suffer Blood Loss." This could well be the end for poor Mordechai.*

# **Sudden Death Critical Hits**

Sometimes players just want to know if an opponent is dead or not and don't much care about the details. Where convenient (or if a situation demands it), the GM can speed along combat without adjudicating detailed Critical Hits. In some cases, grievous wounds have already been inflicted, so it's just a matter of finishing an enemy off. In these instances, use the Sudden Death method. Any Critical Damage results in the target's death, i.e. they will die when they take any Damage in excess of their Wounds. This rule is especially useful when dealing with minor foes, such as nameless gangers and cultists, though it should not be used for PCs or NPCs, who probably deserve better.

# **Permanent Effects**

Some Critical Effects are permanent. Should a character suffer more than one of these effects, it's probably time to start looking for some bionic replacements (see **Chapter V: armory, [page 153](#page-153-0)**) or retire the poor fellow and roll up a new one. Whenever a character suffers a permanent effect, they apply the following changes to their character.

# **Lost Hand**

You take a –20 penalty on all Skill and Characteristic Tests that rely on the use of two hands and you cannot wield twohanded weapons. A shield can be strapped to the injured arm, however. Should this be your primary hand, you take the customary -20 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack with weapons using your secondary hand. For every 100 xp you spend, you can reduce this penalty by 10.

If you lose both hands, you can either secure at least one replacement or get someone to sharpen your teeth.

# **Lost Arm**

As for a lost hand, but you cannot strap a shield to the arm since you don't have one. Losing both arms is just as bad, plus it's a bit difficult to reach those hard-to-clean spots. Once again, either look into replacement limbs or consider rolling up a new character.

# **Lost Eye or Blinded**

Losing one eye permanently reduces your Ballistic Skill by -10. In addition, you take a –20 penalty to all Skill and Characteristics Tests that rely on sight. Should you have the misfortune to lose both eyes, you gain the Blind trait (see **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists, [page](#page-329-0) [329](#page-329-0)**). You can of course continue to serve the Inquisition as you don't need your eyes to see the truth.

# **Lost Foot**

Reduce all your movement by half permanently (round up) and take a –20 penalty to Skill and Characteristic Tests that rely on mobility, such as the Dodge skill. Losing both feet makes it hard to walk. Perhaps one of your fellow Acolytes will carry you…

# **Lost Leg**

Treat this as a lost foot, but you cannot use the Dodge skill. Losing both legs makes you half the servant of the Emperor you were—a fact not lost on your enemies.

# **Deafened**

You cannot hear at all, or at least not well enough to communicate with others. Until you recover or have this disability repaired, you will automatically fail any Skill or Characteristic Test that relies on sound. Apart from also having trouble communicating with your fellow Acolytes, the GM is free to decide whenever being deaf will have an effect in the game.

| 1                                         | A blast to the arm leaves it all numb and tingly. Tests made involving the arm are at –30 for 1 Round.        |
| 2                                         | The attack smashes the arm, sending currents of energy crackling down to the fingers and up to                |
|                                           | the shoulder. The arm is useless for 1d5 Rounds and the character takes 1 level of Fatigue.                   |
| 3                                         | The attack burns the target's arm leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and inflicts 2 levels of Fatigue.           |
|                                           | The arm is useless for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                            |

|                                           | The arm is useless for 1d10 Rounds.                                                                           |
| 5                                         | The arm suffers superficial burns inflicting no small amount of pain on the target. The target's WS and       |
|                                           | BS are halved (round down) for 1 Round and the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                            |
| 6                                         | The attack wreathes the arm in flame, scorching clothing and armor, and temporarily fusing together          |
|                                           | the target's fingers. The target halves WS and BS for 1d10 Rounds, takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, and must      |
|                                           | successfully Test Toughness or lose the use of the hand permanently.                                          |
| 7                                         | With a terrible snapping sound, the heat of the attack boils the marrow in the target's arm, causing it       |
|                                           | to shatter. The target's arm is broken and until it is repaired the target counts as only having one arm. The |
|                                           | target is Stunned for 1 Round and also takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                           |
| 8                                         | Energy sears through the arm at the shoulder, causing the limb to be severed from the body. The               |
|                                           | target must take a Toughness Test or become Stunned for 1 Round. In addition the target takes 1d10            |
|                                           | levels of Fatigue and is suffering from Blood Loss. The target now only has one arm.                          |
| 9                                         | Fire consumes the target's arm, burning the flesh to a crisp right down to the bone. The target must          |
|                                           | make an immediate Toughness Test or die from shock. If he survives, however, the target takes 1d10            |
|                                           | levels of Fatigue and is Stunned for 1 Round. The target now only has one arm.                                |
| 10+                                       | The attack reduces the arm to a cloud of ash and sends the target crumbling to the ground where they          |
|                                           | immediately die from shock, clutching their smoking stump.                                                    |

The target is Stunned for 2d10 Rounds and the attack halves his Strength,Toughness and Agility. The extensive scarring permanently halves the target's Fellowship characteristic.                                                                   |  |

| 7                                         | The energy attack fries the leg, leaving it a mess of blackened flesh. The leg is broken and until repaired, |
|                                           | the target counts as having lost the leg. The target must take a Toughness Test or become Stunned            |
|                                           | for 1 Round. In addition the target gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The target now only has one leg.            |
| 8                                         | Energy sears through the bone, causing the leg to be severed. The target must take a Toughness Test          |
|                                           | or become Stunned for 1 Round. In addition the target gains 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is suffering          |

| 9                                         | The force of the attack reduces the leg to little more than a chunk of sizzling gristle. The target must     |
|                                           | Test Toughness or die from shock. The leg is utterly lost.                                                   |
| 10+                                       | In a terrifying display of power, the leg immolates and fire consumes the target completely. The target dies |

| 1                                          | The impact fills the target's head with a terrible ringing noise. The target must Test Toughness or take      |  |

| 5                                          | The force of the blow sends the target reeling in pain. The target is Stunned for 1 Round.                    |  |
| 6                                          | The target's head is snapped back by the attack leaving him staggering around trying to control mind-numbing  |  |

| 7                                          | The attack slams into the target's head, fracturing his skull and opening a long tear in his scalp.           |  |
|                                            | The target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and halves all movement for 1d10 hours.                                 |  |

|                                            | Anyone within 4 metres of the target must make an Agility Test or suffer a –10 penalty to their WS            |  |
|                                            | and BS on their next Turn as gore gets in their eyes or on their visors.                                      |  |

The targetis Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and is permanently deafened. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue andcan only take Half Actions for 1d5 hours. Finally, the target's Fellowship drops by 1d10 due tohideous scarring. |  |
| 6                                             | The target's head explodes under the force of the attack, leaving his headless corpse to spurt bloodfrom the neck for the next few minutes. Needless to say this is instantly fatal.                                                                                                                                              |  |

For the rest of the fight, anyone moving over this spot must make an Agility Test or fall over.                                                                                                                     |  |
| 9                                             | The target ceases to exist in any tangible way, entirely turning into a kind of crimson mist. You don'tget much deader than this, except…                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |

Table 7-20: Explosive Critical Effects – Arm **Critical Damage Effect** 1 The attack throws the limb backwards, painfully jerking it away from the body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue. 2 The attack sends a fracture through the limb. The target drops anything held in the hand and takes 2 levels of Fatigue. 3 The explosion takes 1d5 fingers from the target's hand. The target takes 3 levels of Fatigue and anything carried in the hand is destroyed. If this is an explosive, it goes off. Messy. 4 The blast causes the target to howl in agony. He takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, is Stunned for 1 Round, and the limb is useless until medical attention is received. 5 Fragments from the explosion tear into the target's hand, ripping away flesh and muscle alike. He must immediately Test Toughness or lose the hand. Even on a success, the hand is useless until medical attention is received. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. 6 The explosive attack shatters the bone and mangles the flesh turning the target's arm into a red ruin, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The target's arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm. In addition, the horrendous nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss. 7 In a violent hail of flesh, the arm is blown apart. The target must immediately make a Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 rounds, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and suffers Blood Loss. He now only has one arm. 8 The arm disintegrates under the force of the explosion taking a good portion of the shoulder and chest with it. The target is sent screaming to the ground, where he dies in a pool of his own blood and organs. 9 With a mighty bang the arm is blasted from the target's body, killing the target instantly in a rain of blood droplets. In addition, if the target was carrying a weapon with a power source in his hand (such as a power sword or chainsword) then it explodes, dealing 1d10+5 Damage to anyone within two metres. 10+ As above, except if the target is carrying any ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres (this is in addition to Damage caused by exploding power weapons noted above). If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on his person.

# Table 7-21: Explosive Critical Effects – Body **Critical Damage Effect** 1 The target is blown backwards 1d5 metres and takes 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. He is Prone when he lands. 2 The target is blown backwards 1d10 metres, taking 1 level of Fatigue per metre travelled. If he strikes a solid object, he takes 1d5 additional levels of Fatigue. 3 The explosion destroys whatever armor protected the body. If the target wore none, the target is blown backwards 1d10 metres, as above but the target takes 2 levels of Fatigue for every metre travelled. 4 The explosion sends the target sprawling to the ground. He takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue, is Stunned for 1 Round, and must spend a Full Action to regain his feet. 5 Concussion from the explosion knocks the target to the ground and tenderises his innards. The target falls down Stunned for 1 Round and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. 6 Chunks of the target's flesh are ripped free by the force of the attack leaving large, weeping wounds. The target is Stunned for 1 Round, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is now suffering Blood Loss. 7 The explosive force of the attack ruptures the target's flesh and scrambles his nervous system, knocking him to the ground. The target falls down, is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. In addition, he now suffers Blood Loss and can only take Half Actions for the next 1d10 hours as he tries to regain control of his body. 8 The target's chest explodes outward, disgorging a river of partially cooked organs onto the ground, killing him instantly. 9 Pieces of the target's body fly in all directions as he his torn into bloody gobbets by the attack. In addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on the target's person. 10+ As above, except anyone within 1d10 metres of the target is drenched in gore and must make an Agility Test or take a -10 penalty to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests for 1 Round as blood fouls their sight.

It takes the target a Full Action to regain hisfeet and he halves all movement for 1d10 Rounds.                                                                  |
| 5               | Explosive force removes part of the target's foot and scatters it over a wide area. The target must make animmediate Toughness Test or permanently loses the use of his foot, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. On a success,the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and halves his movement until he receives medical attention. |
| 6               | The concussive force of the blast, shatters the target's leg bones and splits apart his flesh, inflicting 1d10 levelsof Fatigue. The leg is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. In addition, thehorrendous nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss.                      |
| 7               | The explosion reduces the target's leg into a hunk of smoking meat. The target must immediatelymake a Toughness Test or die from shock. On a successful Test, the target is still Stunned for 1d10Rounds, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.                                          |

| 9               | The leg explodes in an eruption of blood, killing the target immediately and sending tiny fragmentsof bone, clothing, and armor hurtling off in all directions. Anyone within two metres of the targettakes a 1d10+2 Impact Damage.                                                                                             |
| 10+             | As above, except in addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these toodetonate on the target's person.                                                                                             |

| 6               | As the blow rips violently across the target's face— it takes with it an important feature. Roll 1d10 to seewhat the target has lost. 1–3: Eye (see Permanent Effects on page 201), 4–7: Nose (permanently halveFellowship), 8–10: Ear (permanently reduce Fellowship by 1d10; you can always hide the wound with yourhair.) In addition the target is now suffering Blood Loss and takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. |
| 7               | In a splatter of skin and teeth, the attack removes most of the target's face. He is permanently blindedand has his Fellowship permanently reduced to 1d10, and also now has trouble speaking without slurringhis words. In addition, the target is suffering from Blood Loss and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                      |

| 1                                           | If the target is not wearing armor on this location, he takes 1 level of Fatigue from a painful laceration.If he is wearing armor, there is no effect. Phew!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |  |  |  |
| 2                                           | The attack Damages the target's armor, reducing its armor Points by 1. In addition, the target takes1 level of Fatigue. If not armored, the target is also Stunned for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  |  |  |  |
| 3                                           | The attack rips a large patch of skin from the target's torso, leaving him gasping in pain. The targetis Stunned for 1 Round and takes 2 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |  |  |  |
| 4                                           | A torrent of blood spills from the deep cuts, making the ground slick with gore. All charactersattempting to move through this pool of blood must succeed on an Agility Test or fall Prone. Thetarget takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  |  |  |  |
| 5                                           | The blow opens up a long wound in the target's torso, causing him to double over in terrible pain. Thetarget takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |  |  |  |  |
| 6                                           | The mighty attack takes a sizeable chunk out of the target and knocks him to the ground as he clutchesthe oozing wound, shrieking in pain. The target is Prone and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |  |  |  |  |
| 7                                           | The attack cuts open the target's abdomen, causing considerable Blood Loss and exposing some ofhis innards. The target can either choose to use one arm to hold his guts in (until a medic can bindthem in place with a successful Medicae Test), or fight on regardless and risk a 20% chance each turnthat his middle splits open, spilling his intestines all over the ground, causing an additional 2d10Damage. In either case, the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is now suffering Blood Loss. |  |  |  |  |
| 8                                           | With a vile tearing noise, the skin on the target's chest comes away revealing a red ruin of muscle. Thetarget must make a Toughness Test or die. If he passes, he permanently loses 1d10 from his Toughness,takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and now suffers Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |  |  |  |
| 9                                           | The powerful blow cleaves the target from gullet to groin, revealing his internal organs and spillingthem on to the ground before him. The target is now quite dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |  |  |  |
| 10+                                         | As above, except that the area and the target are awash with gore. For the rest of the fight, anyonemoving within four metres of the target's corpse must make an Agility Test or fall over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |  |  |  |

|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1               | The attack knocks the limb backwards, painfully jerking it away from the body. The target takes 1                   |
|                 | level of Fatigue.                                                                                                   |
| 2               | The target's kneecap splits open. He must Test Agility or fall to the ground. Regardless, he takes 1 level          |
|                 | of Fatigue.                                                                                                         |
| 3               | The attack rips a length of flesh from the leg, causing blood to gush from the wound. The target takes              |
|                 | 1 level of Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss.                                                                          |
| 4               | The attack rips the kneecap free from the target's leg, causing it to collapse out from under him. The target       |
|                 | moves at half speed until medical attention is received. In addition, he takes 2 levels of Fatigue.                 |
| 5               | In a spray of blood, the target's leg is opened up, exposing bone, sinew and muscle. The target takes               |
|                 | 1d5 levels of Fatigue and halves his movement for 1d10 hours.                                                       |
| 6               | The blow slices a couple of centimetres off the end of the target's foot. The target must make an immediate         |
|                 | Toughness Test or permanently lose the use of his foot. On a success, movement is halved until he receives medical  |
|                 | attention. In either case, the target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                  |
| 7               | The force of the blow cuts deep into the leg, grinding against bone and tearing ligaments apart. The leg is         |
|                 | broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. In addition, the level of maiming is such     |
|                 | that the target is now suffering from Blood Loss. He also takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue.                             |
| 8               | In a single bloody hack the leg is lopped off the target, spurting its vital fluids across the ground. The target   |
|                 | must immediately make a Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for                   |
|                 | 1d10 Rounds, takes 1d10 Fatigue and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.                                    |
| 9               | With a meaty chop, the leg comes away at the hip. The target pitches to the ground howling in                       |
|                 | agony, before dying moments later.                                                                                  |
| 10+             | As above, except that the tide of blood is so intense that, for the remainder of the battle, anyone making a Run or |
|                 | Charge Action within six metres of the target this Turn, must make an Agility Test or fall over.                    |

# **SPECIAL DAMAGE**

The horrors of battle are not the only way to die in the Dark Heresy universe. Acolytes may find themselves set on fire, suffocating to death, falling from a great height or, worst of all, exposed to the cold vacuum of space. These are collectively known as Special Damage and they are dealt with in this section.

# **Fire**

Characters take Damage each Round if exposed to fire. If you are exposed to the same fire source for two or more consecutive Rounds (or if you are hit with a Flame weapon as detailed in **Chapter V: armory, [page 128](#page-128-0)**), you must make an Agility Test each Round or catch on fire. Once you are blazing, you lose 1d10 Wounds (with no reduction for armor) and take 1 level of Fatigue each Round until the fire is extinguished. All Damage from fire is counted as Energy Damage for the purpose of Critical Damage, and applied to the body. When on fire, a character must make a Willpower Test to act normally, otherwise they may only run around and scream (count as a Full Action).

Once a character is on fire, he may try and put himself out by taking a Full Action and making a Hard (-20) Agility Test, i.e. stop, drop and roll. The GM may make this Test easier or harder depending on such factors as allies helping to beat out the flames, leaping into water or loose sand, high winds etc.

# **Falling**

Characters can fall off things for all manner of reasons, though the results are usually the same. To work out Damage from falling, find the distance fallen and consult **Table 7-27: Falling Damage** to work out the Damage the character suffers. Roll on the **Table 7-27: Hit Location, [page 194](#page-194-0)** to see which part of his body hits the ground first. armor offers no protection against falls. Damage from falling is counted as Impact Damage for the purpose of Critical Damage.

| Table 7-27: Falling Damage |         |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Distance Fallen            | Damage  |
| 3 metres                   | 1d10+3  |
| 6 metres                   | 1d10+5  |
| 9 metres                   | 1d10+7  |
| 12 metres                  | 1d10+9  |
| 15 metres                  | 1d10+11 |
| 18 metres                  | 1d10+13 |
| 21 metres                  | 1d10+15 |
| 24 metres                  | 1d10+17 |
| 25+ metres                 | 1d10+20 |
|                            |         |

# **Suffocation**

There are many ways to suffocate. Drowning is the most common, but the inhalation of smoke and certain gases also does the trick. The rate of suffocation depends on your activity level. If you are actively trying to conserve oxygen, you may hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your Toughness Bonus. Test Toughness each minute. A failure indicates that you take 1 level of Fatigue. If you do not gain a fresh source of oxygen at the end of this period, regardless of your Fatigue level you immediately fall unconscious and start to expire. From this point onwards, at the end of each Round, you take 1d10 Damage until you experience death once you reach 0 Wounds. armor or Toughness Bonus' do not reduce the Damage incurred.

# **Example**

*Shawnmaker, an Arbitrator with a TB of 3, is trapped in an airless corridor. Knowing that his allies are nearby with a lascutter, he decides to sit down and conserve his breath. Shawnmaker can hold his breath for three minutes, so his friends have just enough time to slice through the corridor walls. After the first minute of breath holding, Shawnmaker takes a level of Fatigue. After the second minute, he takes a further level of Fatigue. Finally, after the third minute Shawnmaker takes another level of Fatigue. If rescue does not arrive in the fourth minute Shawnmaker will take another level of Fatigue, fall unconscious and start to suffocate.*

If you are engaged in strenuous activity (combat, swimming and the like) you may hold your breath for a number of Rounds equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. After this period, you lose 1 Wound and gain a level of Fatigue at the end of each Round. Should you fall unconscious due to Fatigue, you take 1d10 Damage at the end of each Round until death. armor or Toughness Bonus do not reduce the Damage incurred.

*Shawnmaker has a TB of 3 and 9 Wounds. He can hold his breath under the murky waters of a hive sump for six Rounds before he begins to take Fatigue and lose Wounds. After a further four Rounds,* 

# **Vacuum**

There is nothing good about being exposed to vacuum. There are two ways this unfortunate event could occur: a character can be suddenly thrust into an airless, pressureless environment (such as being expelled from an airlock), or they can be slowly affected (such as being trapped on a star ship as its atmosphere is vented into space).

If suddenly exposed to vacuum, you may survive unharmed for a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus. Unless you have an oxygen source, you will also begin to suffer from the effects of suffocation. At the end of each Round after this, you suffer 1d10+3 Explosive Damage from depressurisation. If you are in the vacuum of space, at the end of each Round make a Toughness Test. A failure indicates that you suffer 1d10 Energy Damage from the extreme cold. In both cases, any armor worn does not reduce the Damage incurred.

If you die in space, it takes five Rounds for your corpse to freeze. If your corpse suffers any Damage whilst frozen, it shatters into thousands of blood-red ice shards. There is precious little, except perhaps a Daemonic pact, which can bring you back from such a fate.

If you are trapped in a gradually worsening atmosphere, you may survive unharmed for a number of Rounds equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. At the end of this time, you will begin to experience suffocation. You will also begin to feel the effects of depressurisation. From this point onwards, at the end of each Round you must make a Toughness Test with a cumulative –10 penalty. Success indicates that you take 1d5 Explosive Damage but are otherwise unaffected. Failure means that you suffer 1d10 Explosive Damage. In both cases armor will not reduce the Damage incurred.

*"Success is measured in blood; yours or your enemy's."* — *Tactica Imperialis.*

A As you accumulate Damage, you become more injured until finally, you suffer dreaded Critical Damage. How much Damage you have taken determines the severity of your injuries, describing whether you are Lightly, Heavily, or Critically Wounded. These states determine the time it takes to heal. You remove Damage at a fixed rate regardless of your level of activity. However, if you spend your time resting comfortably and not engaging in any strenuous activity (e.g. fighting, using Psychic Powers, herding Grox, etc.), you can remove Damage more quickly.

### **Lightly Wounded**

You are considered Lightly Wounded if you have taken Damage equal to or less than twice your Toughness Bonus. (if you have a 3 Toughness Bonus, then you are Lightly Wounded if you take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 Damage.) Without medical attention or drugs, you remove 1 Damage per day. If you spend this time resting in bed, you remove an amount of Damage equal to your Toughness Bonus.

### **Heavily Wounded**

You are Heavily Wounded whenever you have taken more Damage than twice your Toughness Bonus (so if you have 3 Toughness Bonus, you are considered Heavily Wounded if you have taken more than 6 Damage). Without medical attention, you remove 1 Damage per week through natural healing. If you spend the entire week resting, you remove an amount of Damage equal to your Toughness Bonus. Once your Damage is equal to or less than your Toughness Bonus, you become Lightly Wounded.

### **Critically Wounded**

You are Critically Wounded whenever you have taken Critical Damage. You do not recover without medical attention. With medical attention, you remove 1 point of Critical Damage for each week of rest. Once all Critical Damage has been removed, you become Heavily Wounded instead.

# **Medical Attention**

Medical attention is any Action by another character or by yourself to treat your injuries. Such efforts can range from the application of healing drugs, being the recipient of a successful Medicae Test, or even using Psychic Powers that can restore lost Wounds. Medical Attention can provide immediate recovery or can speed the process of natural healing. For more information, check out the Medicae skill in **Chapter III: Skills** on **[page 104](#page-104-0)**.

## **Blood Loss**

Characters suffering from Blood Loss have a 10% chance of dying each Round unless treated in some way. Provided the character is conscious, they may attempt a Medicae Test each Round to staunch the bleeding. If they are stationary whilst attempting to stop the blood, this test is merely Difficult (-10). If they are taking part in strenuous activity, such as combat or movement, this test is Very Hard (–30). If the character is not conscious, or doesn't fancy his chances, another character may attempt the test.

## **Broken Limbs**

Certain Critical Effects indicate a risk of permanently losing a limb. To avoid this fate, the character must succeed on a Toughness Test. Should a character with the Medicae skill be present and assisting the injured character, the victim gains a +20 bonus to this test to retain the limb. The limb must be held in a sling for 1d5+1 weeks and is useless during this time.

Should this test fail, the limb must be removed, requiring a character with the Medicae skill to succeed on a Difficult (-10) Medicae Test. Should this fail, the limb still comes off, but the surgery inflicts 1d10 Damage to the limb—almost always Critical Damage. Should the amputee live, the limb comes off, but he suffers Blood Loss and must be treated for it. Once this has been dealt with, the chirurgeon must treat the wound as if it were an amputated limb (see following).

### **Amputated Limbs**

A character that loses body parts (except for their heads—this pretty much means death, unless you have the good fortune of having your brain somewhere else in your body) is also affected by Blood Loss and must be treated for that first. Should this succeed and the character lives, someone with the Medicae skill must be found to adequately treat the stump to ensure that it heals well. If no medic is available, there is only a 20% chance that it will heal over. If it does not, the amputee dies a horrible death from infection after 1d10 days. Whether or not it heals naturally or a medic treats it, the character will not start removing Damage for 1d10+2 days.

### **Cybernetic and Bionic Replacements**

It is possible to restore lost limbs with bionic replacements; in fact, sometimes you may prefer to lop off a perfectly good arm or leg to gain the benefits of having a cybernetic one. The rules for both removing and attaching cybernetic, bionic and bio-enhanced limbs, implants and weapons are detailed fully in **Chapter V: armory**.

# **MOVEMENT**

*"Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment."* — Concordium dogma.

U Under most circumstances, you need only say that you want your character to go somewhere and eventually he gets there. How fast the character moves rarely matters in ordinary situations, but when it comes to some things, the speed with which a character can move can become very important. A chase through the streets, a charge against a brutal Ork or any number of other factors can all mean the difference between life and death.

During a Round, characters may move at one of four speeds: Half Move, Full Move, Charge, or Run. The number of metres a character may move in his Turn is determined by his Agility Bonus. Traits can modify some or all movement speeds. Details on these modes of movement can be found under Combat.

| Table 7-28: Movement (metres/round) |           |           |        |     |  |  |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|--|--|

In some situations, it may be important to note how fast a character can travel in Narrative Time. **Table 7-29: Narrative Movement** describes the standard speeds a character can move at a leisurely pace under ideal circumstances. Environment (see following) can affect these speeds, hindering the characters as they travel.

| Table 7-29: Narrative Movement |                              |          |          |

# **Narrative Movement and Terrain**

Terrain conditions affect how fast your character can cover ground during Narrative Time. Obviously, picking your way through a death world jungle is far more laborious than moving along a major road.

Halve distances when moving through tightly packed foliage, dense urban areas or similarly difficult terrain.

The Game Master will determine what, if any, modifiers apply to Narrative Time caused by the environment.

# **Hurrying**

Characters can pick up the pace, moving up to double their movement in Narrative Time for a number of hours equal to their Toughness Bonus. At the end of this time, characters must successfully Test Toughness or take 1 level of Fatigue. In addition, hurrying characters are less likely to pay attention to their surroundings and thus take a –10 penalty to all Perception Tests. Characters may push on, even with these penalties, but they must Test Toughness, with a cumulative –10 penalty, again after a number of hours equal to their reduced Toughness Bonus or take additional levels of Fatigue.

# **Example**

*Lucretious is hurrying to reach a research outpost, so he covers 12 kilometres per hour. His Toughness is 41, so he can hurry for four hours before he needs to Test Toughness.*

# **Running and Narrative Time**

Characters can run during Narrative Time, but doing so is tiring. When running, a character triples his rate of movement, but each hour of sustained running requires the character to Test Toughness, with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour after the first, to sustain the pace. On a failed Test, the character takes 1 level of Fatigue. Characters moving at this brisk pace are focused on running and watching their steps, so they take a –20 penalty to all Perception Tests. As with hurrying, characters can continue running after a failed Test, but penalties gained from multiple failed Tests are cumulative.

# **Example**

*Kyba has a TB of 2 and runs to reach the village ahead of the Orks, some 30 kilometres away, who should arrive in four hours. She normally moves at 4kph. But because she's running, she's moving 12kph, meaning she'll reach the village in just over two hours if she can sustain the pace. After the first hour of running, she Tests Toughness and fails. She takes 1 level of Fatigue. After her second hour, she's covered 24 kilometres, but she needs to Test Toughness again, this time at a -20 penalty. She fails again! Half an hour later, Kyba reaches the village exhausted, having taken 2 levels of Fatigue.* 

There's nothing stopping characters from pushing themselves beyond the standard ten hours of marching. Characters may safely push themselves for a number of extra hours equal to their Toughness Bonus. Beyond this, a character must Test Toughness, with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour, for each hour he travels beyond his Toughness Bonus. A failed Test indicates that the character takes a level of Fatigue. It is possible to march oneself into unconsciousness. Fatigue taken from forced marching is removed after the character has rested for two hours for each hour they marched beyond their Toughness Bonus.

# **MOVEMENT AND ENVIRONMENT**

The movement rates for characters described on **Table 7-28: Movement (Metres/Round)** assume a relatively clear battlefield. There may be a few obstacles, puddles or wisps of fog, but characters can more or less, move at their standard rates. There are, however, some circumstances that reduce a character's speed. These can include rubble-strewn hallways, deep snow, dense fog, thick underbrush and a variety of other conditions that make it tough to navigate. In such environments, a character's movement is halved. If a character charges or runs, he must succeed on an Agility Test or fall prone. The difficulty of this Test depends on the terrain. See **Table 7-30: Treacherous Environments** for suggestions.

| Table 7-30: Treacherous Environments |                  |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| Condition                            | Difficulty       |
| Fog or Smoke                         | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Mud                                  | Challenging (+0) |
| Shallow Water                        | Challenging (+0) |
| Darkness                             | Difficult (–10)  |
| Snow                                 | Difficult (–10)  |
| Underbrush                           | Difficult (–10)  |
| Dense Crowds                         | Hard (–20)       |
| Zero Gravity                         | Hard (–20)       |
| Rubble                               | Hard (–20)       |
| Tremors                              | Hard (–20)       |

# **Forced Marching** **CLIMBING**

There are bound to be times when you want to climb over a wall, scale a cliff, or scramble up a tree to escape the claws of a vicious xenos. Any character with both hands free can climb any non-sheer surface with a Strength (or Climb) Test. On a success, you ascend or descend at a rate of one-half your Half Move speed (to a minimum of a 1/2 metre). For each degree of success, you climb an extra metre. On a failed Test, you fall from your starting climbing position. Climbing Difficulty varies with the nature of the climbing surface, though most tests should be Challenging (+0).

# **Sheer Surfaces**

Certain surfaces are beyond the means of ordinary characters to climb. Naked stone walls without hand-holds, vertical ascents and overhangs all require some skill at climbing to navigate. You may attempt a Climb Skill Test to climb these surfaces at one-half your Half Move speed. Otherwise, you must have tools such as a knotted rope or blanket, rope ladder or ladder. If you can take your time and are not threatened by opponents, you may ascend at one-half your Half Move rate without Testing Strength. You may try to climb more quickly or when you are being attacked, but you must Test Strength as if you were climbing a non-sheer surface.

# **Abseiling**

You can descend ropes and ladders more quickly by abseiling. You descend at a rate of 10 metres per Round with a successful Agility Test. If the Test is failed, the rate is reduced to 5 metres per Round. However, if the Test is failed by two or more degrees, you must Test Strength or lose your grip. Unless you have a climbing harness, you fall.

# **The Effects of Gravity**

Although the inhabited worlds of the Imperium may vary slightly in terms of gravity, the effects on game play are minimal. Only when characters explore high- or low-gravity worlds are movement, lifting and other factors affected.

### **Low Gravity Worlds**

On worlds of low gravity, all characters increase their Agility Bonus by 2 for the purposes of movement . In addition, characters add 4 to the total of their Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining carrying, lifting and pushing limits. Characters also add 2 to their Strength Bonus for determining how far they can throw objects. Double all Jumping and Leaping distances.

# **High Gravity Worlds**

On worlds of high gravity, all characters decrease their Agility Bonus by 2 (to a minimum of 1) for the purposes of movement. In addition, characters subtract 4 (to a minimum 0) from the total of their Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining carrying, lifting and pushing limits. Characters also subtract 2 from their Strength Bonus (to a minimum of 0) for determining how far they can throw objects. Finally, halve all Jumping and Leaping distances.

# **JUMPING**

A Jump is a controlled vertical ascent or descent that generally allows you to reach a ledge overhead or land on your feet. If you're pushed, or plummet, you're not Jumping but falling (see **Falling**).

# **Jumping Up**

You can make a standing Jump to hop up to reach something above you or land on a higher level. Doing so requires an Agility Test. On a success, you Jump up a number of centimetres equal to 20 times your Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, you add another number of centimetres equal to 10 times your Strength Bonus.

# **Example**

*Keira wants to Jump up and catch the lip of a ledge about one metre (100 centimetres) over her head. She has a 36 Strength (3 SB). She rolls and gets a 22. She succeeds with one degree of success. So, she Jumps up 90 centimetres ([SB×20]+30). Not quite enough for her to grab the edge of the ledge.*

# **Jumping Down**

When Jumping down, you must make an Agility Test for each metre of descent. On a failed Test, you stop making Agility Tests and fall the remaining distance. So if you fail the first Test, you fall the entire distance and take Damage for falling (see **Falling**).

# Leaping **LEAPING**

A Leap is a horizontal jump. It is used to traverse from roof to roof or to cross chasms, ditches and so on. There are two types of Leap: running and standing. In both cases, they are Full Actions.

# **Running Leaps**

In a Running Leap, you must move at least four metres in a straight line leading up to the Leap. At the end of your movement, you Leap across a number of metres equal to your Strength Bonus. Make a Strength Test. For each degree of success, you Leap an extra 50 centimetres. For each degree of failure, you Leap 50 centimetres less (minimum 0 metres—you probably move a few dozen centimetres, but not a full metre). For every four metres run up beyond those required for the Leap you get a +10 bonus (maximum +30) to your Strength Test.

# **Standing Leaps**

A Standing Leap is similar to a Running Leap, except, obviously, you don't have to run first. You calculate your distance as a running Leap, but you take a –10 penalty to your Strength Test.

# **Example**

*Our friend Keira is on a rooftop. To get onto the building containing her target, she must make a Leap of four metres. Keira has 36 Strength (3 SB) so she had better roll well or she's going to splatter on the street below. Keira backs up eight metres and then starts her run. She crosses the distance and then makes a Strength Test. Because she ran four extra metres, she gets a +10 bonus to her Strength Test. She rolls and gets a 26! A success by two degrees (36+10=46). If she had just succeeded on the Test, she would have leapt three metres, but because she got two degrees of success, she instead leapt four metres, which is just enough to cross the gap.*

# **Vertical Distance**

Should it be important, the height you attain while leaping is equal to one quarter the distance in metres travelled. A result of 0 or less means that you gained enough altitude to leap, but not enough to clear any obstacles.

# Swimming **SWIMMING**

A character doesn't need to make a Swim Test under ideal circumstances, but hazardous conditions such as rough waters, hands being tied, or swimming whilst fighting all require Swim Tests to move. To swim under hazardous conditions, you must make a Swim Test as a Move Action. A success indicates that you move in any direction up to a number of metres equal to one-half your Strength Bonus or simply tread water at your option. A failed Test means that you make no progress and cannot move. If you fail by 2 degrees or more, you sink one metre for every 20kg of your weight.

Characters that are unable to swim for some reason (unconsciousness, paralysis etc.) automatically sink one metre of depth for each 20kg of their weight on their Turn. Theoretically, a character could sink all the way to the bottom and walk their way out of the water if they can hold their breath long enough.

# **Swimming and Narrative Time**

Prolonged swimming can be exhausting. You may swim for a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus (simply substitute your Strength Bonus for Agility Bonus to determine how much distance you travel each hour). After this point, you must make a Toughness Test, with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour and each hour thereafter. On a failed Test, you take 1 level of Fatigue. If knocked unconscious from Fatigue, you sink and probably drown.

# **MOVING & LIFTING**

*"The mortal burden carried dutifully to its destination is the Emperor's greaTest praise."*

— *Lexconicum Moralis.*

N Normally, you don't need to keep track of how much of each item of your equipment you're carrying. Characters in Dark Heresy are assumed to be able to shoulder their backpacks, carry their weapons and don armor without being too hampered. However, there are likely to be instances where it's useful to know how much your character can reasonably lift.

The amount of weight a character can move depends on the sum of your character's Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus. Compare the total to **Table 7-31: Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing** to find out the limits of your might. Note that certain Traits may increase these values.

|       |         | Table 7-31: Carrying, Lifting & Pushing |         |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------------------|---------|
| Total | Carry†  | Lift‡                                   | Push¥   |

† *Carrying Weight indicates how much you can comfortably carry.*  ‡ *Lifting Weight describes how much you can lift off the ground.*  ¥ *Pushing Weight describes how much weight you can shove.*

# **EXCEEDING YOUR CARRYING LIMITS**

If you find yourself carrying more than your normal carrying limits and less than your lifting limit, you are encumbered. You take a –10 penalty to all movement-related Tests and reduce your Agility Bonus by 1 for the purposes of determining movement rates. In addition, after a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus have passed while carrying this weight, you must successfully make a Toughness Test or take 1 level of Fatigue.

While handling weights at your lifting or pushing limits, to move at your normal rate requires a Full Action.

You can try to lift or push more than your limit by Testing Strength. Each degree of success on a Strength Test adds a +1 bonus to the sum of your Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining your limits. If you fail this Test by 2 degrees or more, you take 1 level of Fatigue.

# **THROWING**

As described in **Chapter V: armory**, some weapons are designed to be thrown. The further away the target is from you, the harder it is to hit the target. While ranges for these weapons are determined by your modified Strength Bonus, this system doesn't cover objects not designed for throwing, such as bags of sand, bricks, and so on.

You can throw any object whose weight is equal to or less than half of your lifting weight. To see how far the object travels, Test Strength. A successful Test means that the object flies a number of metres equal to your Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, this distance increases by a factor of 1, so one degree means that you throw the object a number of metres equal to twice your SB, two degrees means that the object is thrown a number of metres equal to your SB×3, three degrees at SB×4 and so on. On a failed Test, the object flies a number of metres equal to half your Strength Bonus (round down; a result of 0 means it fell at your feet). If the object hits a hard surface such as a wall, it takes 1d10+SB Damage plus 1 for every degree of success on your Test.

If you're throwing such an object as an improvised weapon you must make a Ballistics Skill Test rather than a Strength Test. Throwing heavier objects more than half than your lifting weight, but no more than your lifting weight, imposes a Hard (–20) Test penalty.

# **LIGHTING**

*"If you dare enter these dark times, enter."*

— Ordos Hereticus Maxim.

Many adventures in Dark Heresy take place under the cover of night, in the shadowy depths of caves, or in the dank and foetid underhive. As a result, the oppressive darkness becomes a constant enemy, concealing countless terrors and monstrous threats in its depths. For these reasons, light sources are of paramount importance when exploring the dark places of the Imperium.

For simplicity, Dark Heresy uses three levels of light: Bright, Shadow and Darkness. Bright light is any light that allows normal vision, such as sunlight or being within the radius of a torch, glo-lantern, candle and so on. Shadow occurs whenever a normal light source is obscured such as by fog, distance or some similar effect. Darkness, naturally enough, is the absence of light.

Aside from the obvious effects of Darkness and Shadow—being the inability to see, areas of Shadow and Darkness can interfere with a character's movement and combat capabilities. Characters may move through areas of Shadow at no penalty, but may move at only half speed or less through Darkness. Exceeding this speed means that the character may drift in a random direction unless the character succeeds on a Hard (-20) Perception Test. For the effects of lighting on combat, see Combat.

# FLYING

*"It is my belief that foreign travel narrows the mind wonderfully."* — Helem Boesch, Ordo Xenos.

F lying is not a common occurrence for characters in Dark Heresy. Aside from certain rare pieces of tech, or managing to convince a flying creature to hold you, the odds are that the Acolytes will live and die with both feet on the ground. This said, there are plenty of creatures in the *Warhammer 40,000* universe that do benefit from the ability to fly and when they attack it changes the character of the battlefield in challenging ways. The following rules provide an abstract system for dealing with flying.

# **Altitude**

On a planet, there are three broad altitude levels: Hovering, Low, and High. You can change altitude by one level (up or down) during each Move Action taken. If you're using the Charge or Run Actions, you can change altitudes by two levels.

#### **Hovering**

Hovering means that you are skimming just above the ground, no higher than two metres. You can move over obstacles or pits with ease, but attacks can affect you as normal. You can both attack and be attacked by creatures on the ground.

#### **Low**

This altitude indicates that you are flying no more than 15 metres above the ground. You cannot attack or be attacked in melee, but ranged attacks and Psychic Powers are possible. You take no penalties for shooting downwards, but those firing up at you treat you as being 16 metres further away and take a -10 penalty to their Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack you.

### **High**

When flying at this altitude, you are flying far above the ground, beyond the range of all attacks, even those coming from low altitude. You can only attack or be attacked by other creatures flying at High altitude.

# **Example**

*Hybris has secured a powerful grav-harness, granting him a flying movement of 6. On the first Round, he goes from the ground to Hovering and moves 12 metres. On the second Round, he ascends from Hovering to Low altitude and moves another 12 metres. Should a renegade PDF trooper 24 metres away now shoot at Hybris, the Range would be 40 metres because flying at Low altitude adds 16 metres to the Range.*

# **Flying Movement**

Flying creatures and characters are broken up into two categories, each of which is a Trait (see **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists**). They are Hoverers and Flyers. Hoverers can move through the air, but are incapable of gaining more than 2 metres of altitude. A Flyer can go high into the sky, just like a bird.

Each Trait has an associated number. This number describes the character or creature's Flying Movement. This works just like regular movement, but applies only when the creature is flying. In the case of spells and other supernatural effects, Flying Movement is included in its description.

When flying, a character must spend at least one Move Action on his Turn each Round or he'll fall. Hoverers simply land, which causes no Damage. Flyers at Low altitude take Damage from a 15 metre fall, while those at High altitude take Damage from a 25+ metre fall. See **Falling** on **[page 210](#page-210-0)** for more details. The Charge, Attack and Run Actions both count as movement for the purposes of staying in the air.

**"We are at war with forces to terrible to comprehend. We cannot afford mercy for any of its victims too weak to take the correct course. Mercy destroys us; it weakens us and saps our resolve. Put aside all such thoughts. They are not worth of Inquisitors in the service of Our Emperor. Praise his name for in our resolve we only reflect his purpose of will."**

# Chapter VIII: The Game Master

*"Every soul wavers between the Void and the Emperor's Holy Light. Most falter."*

— Inquisitor Kaede, Ordo Hereticus.

The Imperium of Man is vast beyond all mortal reckoning. A legion of Administratum scribes working their entire lives to produce a single accurate accounting of the God-Emperor's realm would be doomed to failure before they had even started as the numbers exist only in a continuous flux. Worlds are constantly being found, lost, rediscovered and destroyed throughout the Imperium. Across this grand sweep of planets every conceivable culture, political system and ideal is somewhere represented. There are wonders and atrocities, saviours and lunatics, sinners and tyrants. There is courage that can break the heart and knowledge that can harrow the soul. All these worlds, as well as those teeming masses dwelling on and between them, are yours to define should you take up the mantle of Game Master. But remember, power corrupts they say, but it is those without it that most often speak thus…

# **THE GM'S LOT**

The Game Master has the vital task of bringing the grim darkness of the far future to life for the rest of the group, mainly by subjecting the Player Characters to the many horrible confrontations they will doubtless have as they make themselves useful to the Inquisition. It is the GM who runs the game, sets the stage that is the Imperium and ensures that everyone is enjoying themselves. It isn't always easy, but it can be a lot of fun and very rewarding. If you're the GM for your group, this chapter is designed to help you with your job, explaining what this game is about and assisting you in coming up with memorable experiences (the terminology for such incidents is usually "adventures" or "scenarios") for your Acolyte band. If you're a player, you may wish to lightly peruse this chapter just to catch a glimpse of some of the horrors that may be in store for your Acolyte.

Your job as GM is a bit like being the director of a play without a finalised script. You've assembled your cast (the players), know where the action is located (somewhere in the Dark Heresy universe), set the proper mood (a dark and merciless future) and have an idea of how the story goes (an adventure)—now you have to bring all these elements together to craft an exciting production. If you do your job well, everyone participating will have fun, perhaps in spite of growing to love and hate you for all the terrifying events you keep subjecting their PCs to!

Before you run your first game, you should prepare yourself:

**Read this rule book—**Don't just skim it—read it. You need to know the rules better than anyone else in the group. You don't need to memorise them, but you should certainly know where to look should a question come up. If you are familiar with *Warhammer Fantasy role play*, you'll find the rules familiar, but note that there are a few critical differences in approach.

**Have a plot in mind—**Before you can run a game, you need to have at least some idea of what will happen. That idea may be as vague as, "The Acolytes meet Ethern the Bone Numberer and then we'll see…" to a fully described, published adventure from Black Industries (one of which is included in the back of this book). Our website also has an ever-growing selection of free adventures to download and run. A pre-designed adventure has the advantage of being ready to play, whereas making up your own, while time-consuming, has its own rewards. Whichever course you choose, be as familiar as you can with the story you've chosen before beginning.

**Ready your supplies—**You will need a small collection of ten-sided dice—two for each player, including yourself—to run Dark Heresy. One character sheet per player, writing implements and some notepaper is also a good idea.

# **Running Dark Heresy**

Once everyone has generated an Acolyte, you can start the game. As Game Master, the following tasks are your main responsibilities:

**Framing the story**—The far future of the Imperium is enormously different from the world we know. It is to you that your players will look for their cues on how their PCs should act and react to the world around them, for you are the lens through which they view the dark future. Describe their surroundings in detail, lingering on what their senses tell them, the sights, the sounds and the smells. The better you are at depicting the right atmosphere, the more invested your players will become in their characters and the adventure.

**Act as the referee**—You are the final arbiter of game rules in all circumstances. When a player wishes to make a Skill Test, you tell them what dice to roll and what penalties or bonuses might be appropriate. You decide what is probable, possible, unlikely and flat-out insane. Keep in mind that it's easy to say "No" to the various stunts your PCs will try to pull off, but often a lot more fun to say "Yes, but there will be consequences…"

**Take on the role of the Non-Player Characters**— Everyone and everything who is not an Acolyte is played by you. Big job, that. This extensive variety of beings are known as Non-Player Characters (NPCs). In Dark Heresy, they range from simple serfs to a variety of alien races with inhuman mindsets. There are several sections later in this chapter to assist in characterising the many roles you will be playing. The important thing to remember is that the PCs are really whom the story is about, and the NPCs you introduce are supposed to serve that end.

# THE EMPEROR'S INQUISITION

The central premise of Dark Heresy is that the PCs are Acolytes of an Inquisitor—exceptional individuals from other paths, whose unique personal attributes have brought them to the attention of a member of the Inquisition. The Acolytes have been recruited to serve their Inquisitor to the best of their ability. Inquisitors are few and scattered, for the Imperium of Man is vast and the its enemies are legion. The powerful Inquisitors have neither the time nor the resources to personally follow up every accusation of heresy that may come to their attention. This is where the players come in.

They are operatives of the Inquisition, empowered to investigate allegations of heresy and other charges of deviant behaviour on behalf of their Inquisitor. While the power of Acolytes is definitely limited compared to that of a full Bearer of the Seal, when the time comes for them to brandish their Inquisitorial Rosettes, few will take them lightly. Most of the time though, Acolytes work in disguise or from the shadows, as word of their presence or actual identities could alert their enemies, especially if the local authorities are the ones they've been sent to investigate.

Acolytes join the Inquisition for as many reasons as there are Acolytes. Many believe the work of the Inquisition is holy and in serving its needs they serve the God-Emperor. Some seek redemption for past deeds, while others just want a clean data-slate. A fair number care only that the Inquisition pays well. Regardless of their reasons for joining their Inquisitor's retinue, the PCs must work

together as part of a group that includes the Inquisitor who recruited them along with other agents that may or may not be known to them. For more details, see **Chapter X: The Inquisition**.

# **KNOW THEM BY THEIR WORKS**

The type of Inquisitor each group of Acolytes works for will affect the majority of Dark Heresy adventures you run for them and will certainly end up colouring their perceptions of the Imperium. While players are often willing to be fairly flexible in what they'll put up with for a one-off game, you can rest assured that if you wish to run a series of linked adventures, usually known as a "campaign", they'll want a say in the nature of their patron Inquisitor. Actually, this can be a great asset to you as a GM and you should strongly consider discussing the merits of various potential Inquisitors with your players before the game begins. Several of the Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave are detailed from **[pages 316](#page-316-0)[–322](#page-322-0)**. They represent a wide range of beliefs and philosophies, affording you and your players a fair number of patron choices. If none of them interest you, you can create another Inquisitor to better suit your group's desires. The sort of Inquisitor they prefer can tell you a lot about what it is they might want from adventures and your campaign. Anyone wanting to work for the Ordo Malleus clearly wishes to struggle against Daemons, just as those seeking employment with an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos crave alien conspiracies. Those that would follow the Ordo Hereticus wish to seek out and eradicate the corruption that lies within.

# **Golden Rules**

There are five golden rules to remember when running a game. While one could, and indeed several people have, written books about the art of game mastering, if you keep these rules in mind you won't go far wrong.

**Always be fair. Remember, you are the referee.** The rules are here to help you make decisions, but many of them rely on your sense of fair play. Since you control the game in a very real sense, it's easy to let that go to your head. Do not give in to that temptation and do not start acting arbitrarily. role playing is a group experience and your players must trust that you'll do the right thing.

**Give them a chance.** Players come up with all kinds of crazy ideas. Often, your first instinct will be to say, 'No, you can't do that.' Resist that urge and stop to consider the action. Players are frequently quite inventive and you don't want to squash that. Rather than just saying 'no', give them a chance—even if it's a small one. They are the heroes of your story after all and they deserve it.

**Lay down the law.** That said, remember you are in charge. Some players delight in running roughshod over carefully prepared games. It is thus sometimes necessary to remind them who's the boss. Other players will try to endlessly argue with you about the rules. Do not let them get away with it. Simply say, "That's my ruling, it's time to move on."

**Don't play favourites.** This goes back to the point about fair play. All your players should get equal "screen time". If one character is dominating a scene, make sure to ask the others what they are doing and try to re-engage them in the game. Also, make sure that everyone gets a chance at interesting story opportunities and whatever special items you deem appropriate to hand out.

**Keep the pace brisk.** You are the narrator of this story, so it is your responsibility to keep it moving. It's easy to get bogged down looking up rules, or going off on a wild tangent. Try to rein that in and keep up the pace. The last thing you want to see when you look up from behind your GM screen is bored faces.

# **Playing the Inquisitor**

Whatever sort of Inquisitor you end up choosing, remember it is the Acolytes who are the true protagonists of your Dark Heresy adventures. Since the Inquisitor is likely to be an NPC played by you, don't make a habit of upstaging the PCs. Make certain the Inquisitor is often busy with other cases, ideally those that are whole subsectors away. In the Imperium, communication between worlds is very slow—astropathic transmissions can take a great deal of time and requests for immediate assistance are often in vain. Your Acolytes should never get the idea that if they call their master whenever they're in trouble he'll be able (or willing) to come rushing to their rescue. Your greatest resource in this could very well be your players—just ask them what their master is doing and why he can't help them. Their answers could even serve to set up future adventures!

# **MANY ARE CALLED, MOST ARE FOUND WANTING**

A lot of role playing games start characters off with few builtin presumptions and no particular expectation of action other than "adventuring"—translation: you are a group of random individuals of varying talents who have coincidentally met in a tavern and decided to set out in search of riches and excitement. Dark Heresy supposes that the PCs are all skilled individuals who were hired by their Inquisitor employer at some point in the "past" of your game's time-line for the specific purpose of assisting him in rooting out heresy within the Calixis Sector. In fact, one or more of the characters may have worked for the Inquisition in such a capacity for many years. Your initial adventure, however, is likely to be the first time the PCs have ever met or worked with one another as a group, as many Inquisitors are fond of gathering cells of diverse Acolytes together whose skills complement one another—a convenient practice from a GM's point of view. A single adventure can take anywhere from one game session to a dozen or more to conclude. Most Dark Heresy adventures are liable to continue until a given case of the Inquisition has been investigated and a variable number of heretics have been either identified for others to handle or dealt with directly by the PCs.

# THEMES IN DARK HERESY

W Whether you intend to plot out a single adventure or lay the framework for an entire campaign, there are certain ideas that resonate throughout Dark Heresy. By planning adventures that help to evoke and further these themes, you will help to immerse your players into the dark distant future of the Imperium.

# **ONE MINUTE TO MIDNIGHT**

The Imperium is tottering on the brink of ruin and disaster. Enemies surround mankind: terrible, rapacious and horrific enemies that seek to destroy humanity utterly. Across the Imperium, man is caught up in countless struggles to survive. Doom fills the air, and the end is nigh. In the Calixis Sector, the terrifying Tyrant Star waxes fat and powerful, ready to unleash hell, unless, that is, the Inquisition can somehow turn back the overwhelming tide of dread and ruin.

# **THERE IS TAINT IN ALL THINGS**

Corruption, in every manner it can be expressed, is everywhere. Entropy is the natural state of the universe. All things inevitably seek to break down into the primal chaos from which they came. The efforts of humanity to hold corruption at bay will ultimately prove to be futile, as every system that has ever been erected to hold off the decay are also subject to it.

Libraries built to maintain accurate knowledge of the past corrode; their codifiers break down introducing errors into the data records. Scrolls are burned, lost, miscopied or deliberately falsified by those who would control the future by altering the past. Institutions form, flourish for a time, then fall short of their promises, forgetting their original purpose. Eventually, many such organisations exist only because tradition dictates that they should do so, for nobody knows why they were created or the meaning of the work they do.

Most obvious to all is the corruption of the body, for mutation has become common on many Imperial worlds, and incidents regarding psykers grow more frequent with every passing century. Subtler still is the threat posed by the many people who slowly adapt physically to their environments, losing the "purity" of the human form and those who have forgone "meat" in favour of metal. Souls and minds fester as surely as flesh. Daemonic influence is ever present. Insanity is rife. Those that seek to do what is just lose their way, their pure motives corroding until they find themselves performing the most debased and vile of acts all in the name of decency.

## Calcified Knowledge and Mystical Technology Know Your Place**

In the Imperium, most of its citizens have no idea how the manifold examples of extant and ancient technology work or that they even exist. A soldier of the Imperial Guard can field strip his lasgun in under thirty seconds, yet he has no grasp of what purpose the various mechanisms he has pulled out of his weapon actually serve. Even the low level Tech-priests of the Mechanicus of Mars have no comprehension of what it is that they do—their knowledge is by rote. Machines work because their operators followed the appropriate rituals to appease the machine's "spirit" not because they pushed the runic button inscribed with the sacred word of power "ON".

The Imperium prizes a stasis of thought. Traditional ways are always the best ways and obedience to dogma without any consideration for what it may mean is common. Thus, both technology and knowledge have become sacred. All but the most basic of technological devices are thought of as supernatural and capable of being regarded as either holy or unholy. Superstition is commonplace, as the breakdown of knowledge has meant that the majority of the populace are unable to comprehend the reasons why something may be so; the citizens of the Imperium rely on charms and ceremonies to allay their fears as they have little capacity for self-examination or critical thinking. Frequent users of any form of technology know a variety of rituals that they must observe to keep the spirits of their machines placated. There are many who truly believe that ignorance is a form of strength. Active scientific research is rare and often regarded with fear. Outside of the followers of the Omnissiah, it is practically non-existent in the Imperium.

# **THERE IS ONLY WAR**

The Imperium has a vast number of worlds that haven't known even a hint of battle for over ten thousand years, but there is no Imperial world within the reach of the Astronomican that doesn't have what is known as a "siege mindset". Constantly harangued about the dangers of xenos threats and more nebulous enemies that lurk out in the dark, the people of the Imperium are forever being reminded that war could come to their world at any time. Every planet's tithes go towards fuelling the Imperial war machine, which is eternally engaged in hundreds, if not thousands, of conflicts across the galaxy. Some are unquestionably large-scale wars, such as the struggle against the chitinous alien horde of living weapons known as the Tyranids that are presently attacking large swathes of the Eastern Fringe, or the ten thousand years long fight against the traitorous ancient followers of the Ruinous Powers that lurk inside the Segmentum Obscurus within the region known as the Eye of Terror. Almost all industries within the Imperium aid the various war efforts in one way or another and the authorities of many planets are often at pains to point out to their citizens how important their efforts are in securing the Imperium's future.

# **KNOW YOUR PLACE**

The Imperium clings strongly to a feudal mentality. Nations brought up following the Imperial Creed have a very definite sense of obligation and a clear idea of what their "place" is within their society. Travel is rare and most citizens never leave the world of their birth. Conformity to what is expected is the norm. Indeed, one of the many reasons why mutants and psykers are so persecuted is because they generally exist outside of the accepted bounds of Imperial culture. The Imperium has three tithes, which it levies against the majority of its worlds:

- Control your psykers and give them over to the Black Ships.
- Whether troops or materials, supply the required amount when asked.
- Have no dealings with enemies of the Imperium.

In exchange for adhering to these three obligations, the Imperium safeguards its worlds against the many dark forces arrayed against them. The majority of Imperial citizens see nothing wrong with this system. Most will report any "witches" they know of (though superstition may silence them) and deviant behaviour when they see it. They willingly join the Imperial Guard when called upon to do so, and the thought of seeing an alien, much less speaking with one, is abhorrent. They proudly serve their leaders and exult in the Imperium's victories. They whisper in awe about the glorious campaigns of the Space Marines and tremble in fear at the thought of ever crossing the Inquisition…

That said, Inquisitors and those they tend to choose as Acolytes are notorious for not knowing their place or even for refusing to accept that they might have a place. It is one of the great ironies of the Inquisition that in order to protect Imperial society, its agents frequently remain outside of it.

# **WE'RE ON A MISSION FROM THE GOD-EMPEROR**

So your players all have their Acolytes ready to uncover heresy, seek out corruption and purge the xenos threat. Time to summon the Daemon into the details. Time to discuss some plot elements you'll need to help craft an adventure worthy of the name Dark Heresy.

# **HEROES, HERETICS AND EVERYONE IN-BETWEEN**

It is the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that you create and play that will do the most to bring the grim future of Dark Heresy alive for your players. A role playing game is populated with all manner of persons that don't matter too much in the overall structure of your adventures. Every irate clerk doesn't really need to be given game statistics. These faceless masses of NPCs serve mainly as setting aids. The few that your Acolytes may actually face in combat should usually have game statistics, but they can't take a whole lot of damage as they mainly serve as cannon fodder.

There are others though, who are special. These are more detailed NPCs and their interactions with the Acolytes should ultimately serve to drive the plots of many of your adventures. Major NPCs do not necessarily need to be as fully detailed as a PC, though they most often will be. Their purpose in your game is to bring depth to the setting by highlighting different aspects of it, and often, to create conflict. Conflict is what drives every good story, though the nature of the conflict varies. In many role playing games, conflict is often violent, but the desires and needs of NPCs can cause other sorts of clashes as well. Whenever you introduce a major NPC, you should consider exactly how he/she/it will interact with your band of Acolytes. The desires and needs of these NPCs will directly affect what they may want from your PCs. The following broad categories cover the majority of what most such major characters could want.

# **Help**

The NPC wishes or needs the assistance of one or more of the Acolytes. The characters' master could questionably fall into this category. No one approaches agents of the Inquisition lightly, so if your PCs have settled in one area long enough to be known to the locals, those approaching them are likely to have very serious problems. Travelling or incognito, PCs could still be asked for help for any number of reasons. Since PCs tend to be fairly competent individuals, one common reason they may be approached is because the NPC wishes to make use of the skills that they have.

# **Exploit**

The NPC intends to use the PCs to his advantage, regardless of their personal desires on the subject. Such an NPC may frame the band (or expose their actual practices to the right people) in order to advance his own position or further his plans. Some Inquisitors push their Acolytes until they break, then casually discard them when they are no longer of use. Note, however, that not all NPCs that set out to utilise the PCs necessarily intend them harm. The nobleman who wishes to see his corrupt brother removed so that he has a clearer line to power may offer his assistance freely to the characters—he is still exploiting them for his own ends, but he is also helping them do their job.

# **Resist**

The NPC opposes the PCs in some way—a state that can range from "friendly rivalry" to "willing to destroy an entire planet, if it will kill one or more of the Acolytes". Generally, any dangerous heretics the PCs ever fight will fall under this category, with the really clever ones perhaps attempting to exploit them as well.

# **Teach**

Often the rarest of NPCs, but still among the most important, instructors and mentors both have this motivation. Such NPCs wish to increase one or more of the Acolytes' skills or understanding. Some truly have an altruistic desire to teach, whereas others will have selfish reasons for imparting their wisdom, in which case they may well intend to use their position of trust with the PCs to manipulate them. One or more of your players' Acolytes could be a student of their employer, especially if the PC is intending to become an Inquisitor himself one day.

Finally, consider how the NPC intends to get what he wants from the Acolytes. What sort of person is he? Will he ask politely, or ruthlessly blackmail the PCs into doing his bidding? Will he seek to have them all killed from a distance or will his honour insist that he look them each one directly in the eyes before he gives orders for them to be cut down. What resources are at his disposal to accomplish his aims? How far is he willing to go if the PCs defy him? Thinking about the answers to these questions before the Acolytes even meet your NPC will help you role play them effectively, especially since no PC will ever do exactly what you expect them to.

There are many ways to run foul of the Emperor's Inquisition. A fair number of Imperial transgressions are not the choice of the offender in question, for example, nobody asks to be born a mutant. Those that wilfully break the Emperor's laws, though, tend to be fairly dangerous types as the penalties are invariably harsh. When creating "bad guys" for your Acolytes to take on, remember that few "villains" ever see themselves as such. Regardless of whatever crimes they have committed, they justify their behaviour, to themselves at least, as appropriate considering their circumstances. In some cases, the PCs may even agree with them, which doesn't make the heretics in question any less guilty.

Variety, as the old saying has it, is the spice of life—it is certainly the key to creating engaging foes for your Acolytes. If every heretic is a Chaos cultist that represents a galaxy-striding evil, your adventures can swiftly become somewhat repetitious. Choose foes with a variety of different means and abilities. It's always worthwhile to come up with one or two really nasty villains—perhaps they/him/it reappear a couple of times in a campaign and become a nemesis to the Acolytes. When your players discover that their Acolytes are trying to stop something truly monstrous, their engagement in the game will be heightened and their fun increased.

# **A PROPER STAGE**

The sheer number of settings available in the Imperium may be somewhat overwhelming. While deciding where you want to set an adventure, think about its scope. Are the Acolytes meant to track down a single fugitive or do you intend them to uncover the tendrils of a massive cult that worships strange alien masters? By thinking in advance about what your PCs will be doing, you can help pick a proper stage (or stages) for them to do it on. Many campaigns can begin and end on a single planet—some of them may never even leave the bowels of a specific hive—but others may well roam from world to world.

The types of adventures you're running are surely influenced by where you set them as well. A "murder mystery" set on a desolate colony world will feel very different to one that plays out in a noble's court. The setting itself can be the primary element in some adventures, especially if you highlight one or more of the parts of the setting unique to Dark Heresy. Take, for example, a ship travelling through the warp, one protected only by the geller fields that hold warp predators at bay. Anyone travelling on such a ship is effectively trapped until it makes its next stop in realspace. But let's persist in this—what is one of the worst things that can happen when you're trapped? Being hunted. So what could hunt the Acolytes? A xenoform? An assassin? Eversor assassins tend to be somewhat… unstable. What if the PCs were hitching a ride with an Inquisitorial ship when an Eversor got loose in the hold, an Eversor whose last orders were to kill everything he came into contact with, until given the right code words to make him stand down? What if the same accident that set him loose killed the only man on board that knew the code words? One night's setting and adventure (staying alive!) all in one.

Just as there are appropriate settings for various adventures, there are a lot of exciting places to have a fight. Whenever there is a likelihood that combat will occur in your game, see if you can arrange for it to be somewhere interesting. Very few fights in Dark Heresy happen out in open fields with no cover. Thinking about the "terrain" in advance will give you some idea of what could happen during the fight, as well as making the fight exciting for your PCs. Combat is deadly in Dark Heresy and battles should always be swift and uncertain—a course one only engages in if there is no other option.

# **HERESIES GREAT AND SMALL**

The following are examples of the types of adventures that members of the Inquisition face on a regular basis. A few of these situations only challenge the inexperienced, for if you're still alive after having investigated the shadows of the Imperium for a century or two, you'll have doubtless learned more than you care to about heresy. Others will test the mettle of even the most stalwart of Inquisitors.

The greatest troubles often begin with only the smallest of warnings; like an iceberg, the modest peak that shows above the surface gives no indication of the scope of that which lies beneath. Many investigations crucial to the Imperium's history have begun simply, heralded by an ominous phrase such as, "Ezekial has been acting strange lately". Experienced agents of the Inquisition soon develop a keen eye for noticing unusual patterns of behaviour and what they might indicate, such as cult activity, Daemonic possession, psychic emergence, xenos influence and so on—the list is long. They also have to be wary that they don't start reading ominous doom in every stray glance and odd bit of conduct that they happen to notice, as there are a fair number of non-heretical explanations for a wide range of unusual activities.

Many Acolytes end up spending a fair amount of time secretly studying suspicious individuals from a distance in order to discern if anything heretical is actually occurring. If they do discover that their subject has succumbed to heresy, their response varies depending on what the heretic is up to. Frequently, however, criminal dealings of one sort or another are the reason for wary conduct. Inquisitors generally expect their Acolytes to report such activity to the local authorities to handle when they find it, as they have better uses for their agents than allowing them to act as impromptu police. Sometimes what appears to be "normal' criminal behaviour is in fact the first clue to a deeper and darker conspiracy, where random threads and clues start to build an elaborate picture of a grand criminal or Daemonic plan. Some Inquisitors, especially those with more flexible morals, are deft at using underworld elements to their advantage—their Acolytes may, in fact, find themselves acting as liaisons between their master and the criminals they've discovered. Such Inquisitors are frequently willing to extend a certain amount of "protection" to the right sort of thugs, in exchange for information, black market goods, extra muscle when needed, etc.

# **We're All Cultists Here**

The only religion "officially" recognised by the Imperium is the Cult of the God-Emperor, which ostensibly follows the Imperial Creed as taught by the preachers of the Adeptus Ministorum. All other cults are heretical, including the Cult Mechanicus, though only the most unthinkingly zealous of priests attempt to preach against the beliefs of the Machine God's followers. While this seems straightforward on the surface, the Imperial Creed has in fact been interpreted countless different ways over the various worlds on which it flourishes. What's more, the Ecclesiarchy was only established as the official religion of

the Imperium close to 3,000 years after the Emperor was encased in the Golden Throne as it had, prior to its ascension, been the largest and most influential of the many cults dedicated to the God-Emperor, all of which had sprung up after His "deification". Consequently, there are many, many different sects within the Imperium, the majority of which can legitimately claim authenticity —although if each was to explain their beliefs in detail to one another a holy war of epic proportions would likely occur, as all sides would regard the others as heretics on account of their deviations from the "one true faith". The Adeptus Ministorum exists to prevent such occurrences, but they still arise from time to time. Generally, the Ecclesiarchy is loath to bring the Inquisition into such matters, though if they must summon an Inquisitor, they will invariably request a member of the Ordo Hereticus.

Whichever particular strain of the Imperial Creed that the Ecclesiarchy favours in any given century is not what concerns the Inquisition, but the ease with which true deviancy can slip by unnoticed into the many variations of the God-Emperor's Cult. Since few Imperial citizens are raised to question authority and the majority are encouraged to believe in what they are told by the members of the Ecclesiarchy, a subtly corrupt priest can do massive damage before being discovered. The populace of entire worlds have been lost to suicide cults and much worse because of warp-tainted demagogues. The medieval mindset of Imperial citizens encourages them to deeply believe in spiritual powers beyond their comprehension, which the Ecclesiarchy tells them should be the God-Emperor. The followers of the Ruinous Powers have learned to take advantage of the Imperial "need to believe" by combining it with the subtle lure of secret lore or privileges. By posing as one of the countless sects of the God-Emperor, one offering certain advantages or boasting a lofty or elitist status, a Chaos cult can ensnare many influential followers. By the time such people are initiated into the "deeper mysteries" that their new sect offers, it is far too late for them to escape its clutches. Those who embrace the worship of the foul Chaos gods turn their back on the Emperor and His works, involving themselves in acts of heinous depravity and utter madness as they walk the razor-lined path to power that the Ruinous Powers offer.

It is one of the primary duties of the Inquisition to root out and destroy cults dedicated to the dark gods of Chaos before they can do any lasting harm. One of the most dangerous tasks that a band of Acolytes can take on is the infiltration and possible elimination of a Chaos cult. Not only is there a very real danger if one is discovered, there is also a terrible chance of warp corruption of the soul from learning too much of a heretical cult's beliefs. These secretive cults are incredibly dangerous opponents, as it can be very difficult to tell how far their influence has spread. It is difficult to rely on local backup if you think they may suddenly turn on you! Worse still, the corruption inherent in such depraved beliefs can often manifest itself in disturbingly tangible ways—the leaders of such cults often have strange powers and are frequently mutants, powerful psykers, Daemon-touched or a combination thereof. While the majority of Acolyte bands will only be involved in the discovery and elimination of such groups, there are some Radical Inquisitors who allow and even encourage heretical cults in the belief that they can use them to further their aims —fighting fire with fire, so to speak. Acolytes working for such an Inquisitor may find their faith sorely tested if they are asked to cooperate in certain rituals…

# **The Creatures Outside**

The Adeptus Ministorum preaches that the Emperor's greatest glory lies in His protection of humanity from the horrors of the immaterium. The Astronomican, which guides the ships of the Imperium through the darkness of the warp, is the most tangible example of his benevolence. The Ecclesiarchy makes a point of not discussing what those unseen terrors might be, though. Within the Imperium, the Navis Nobilite and the Inquisition have the greatest knowledge of what resides in the darkness of the empyrean. The warp is thought to be a dark reflection of the material universe, a place of raw emotion given form. Psykers claim that every soul (save those of Untouchables) flickers as a light in the immaterium. The light of a psyker burns the brightest and, without the proper mental discipline or training, can serve to summon forth the beings that call the warp home when they invoke their powers. While there are a variety of strange life forms that exist in the warp, the type that tends to concern the Inquisition the most are known as warp entities.

Warp entities are creatures that the Ordo Malleus believes to be formed of the raw energy of the immaterium itself. The majority of such creatures seem to be hostile to terrestrial life, but the most dangerous by far are the Daemons of Chaos. Daemons are typically formed from the most extreme thoughts and emotions congealed into a single sentience. The Daemonhunters have spent millennia trying to catalogue all the different forms the Daemon can take, but the task is never complete, as the Daemon hordes seem to be endless. All Daemons hate, yet desire, the world of flesh with terrible endless malice. They hunger for a solid form and the sensations that a body can provide, even as they despise the weaknesses of living beings. Unprotected psykers represent the surest way that Daemons can force their way into realspace, using the unfortunate psyker as an energy conduit to allow them access. Daemons take on a myriad of different appearances in realspace, but all are composed of energy made flesh and even the most "lesser" Daemon is incredibly deadly. Fortunately, as creatures of the immaterium, they require a continuous flow of emotional or psychic power to sustain them or they soon lose physical form and collapse back into energy, returning to the warp whence they came. Unfortunately, areas where Daemons have succeeded in attaining flesh become corrupt as the dimensions stretch thin, making the process of crossing into realspace progressively easier. Eventually the barrier between dimensions can collapse entirely, permanently juxtaposing an area of the immaterium with an equal area of realspace, resulting in a hellish Chaos realm where spirit and flesh become equally malleable. Daemons that wish to stay in realspace for an extended time will try to possess a psyker by seizing control of his body. If the Daemon is successful, the resulting creature is known as a Daemonhost and while often not as powerful as a manifested Daemon, they are still some of the most dangerous beings in the galaxy. Daemons frequently cooperate with the followers of the Chaos gods to benefit from the blasphemous rituals that cultists perform to bring them across from the empyrean and into reality, in order to further the cultists' own power.

Acolytes of the Inquisition, especially those seconded to the Ordo Malleus, are trained to look for signs of Daemonic possession. Such foes cannot go long unopposed, for their power can grow greatly very, very quickly—and Acolytes that discover the undue influence of the warp often have to act swiftly to stop it before it can spread beyond control. The role of the Daemonhunter is a lonely one, for few have the strength of will or the spirit to long endure the terrible knowledge of the Daemonic. Acolytes who take up this most sacred of roles freque-ntly start out pious but often become greatly troubled by what they encounter. Numerous agents eventually succumb to corruption of some sort, if they manage to survive for long. The few that endure with their sanity intact frequently request that they be allowed to either concentrate on other foes or retire entirely from active fieldwork in the service of the Inquisition. Despite the many obvious and manifest dangers of the Daemonic, there are those Inquisitors who believe that the power of Chaos can be used against itself. The most audacious, be they knowledgeable or simply foolish, dare to bind a Daemon into a specially prepared body marked with blessed runes of binding and snared with eldritch sigil-carved chains to form a creature known as a Daemonhost. Daemonhosts are bound to serve their creator and theoretically obey his commands without question, though this is a dubious prospect at best. Any Inquisitor that is ever proved to have created a Daemonhost is automatically declared Excommunicate Traitoris and hunted down by his fellows, invariably led by a squad of Grey Knights—the legendary Chapter of Adeptus Astartes that serves as the Ordo Malleus's chamber militant. So why do Radical Inquisitors even risk such a reprimand? Because Daemonhosts are grotesquely powerful and a potent asset when combating other Daemons and rogue psykers. Acolytes that become aware of an Inquisitor who employs Daemonhosts are honour-bound to report the matter to the Ordo Malleus. Those that don't are automatically condemned along with him if his heresy is ever discovered and their silence is proven.

# **The Problem With Psykers**

Psykers are feared and hated, widely denounced as heretics. The mightiest of their number can unerringly command entire populations, fling their thoughts to the farthest reaches of the galaxy and crush a Battle Titan with their will. They are dangerous potential conduits for Daemons from the immaterium.

One of the responsibilities that Acolytes may take on is the search for newly emerging psykers. Such a task can be a heavy emotional burden, as psykers come from every walk of life and almost none of them asked to be one. Many of them fear and hate what they've become. They are often filled with rage and self-loathing, which, when combined with their newly acquired powers, can make them dangerous and unpredictable opponents. Psykers who have embraced their abilities are even worse. Their control over their psychic talent is seldom precise, but they are often still devastatingly lethal to everyone around them. Psykers who manage to avoid early Imperial detection are forced to hide their powers by going where the standard authorities would be loath to follow them; many Imperial worlds have lawless areas where even the toughest arbitrators will not go and it is there that wyrds can be found, selling their powers to the highest bidder. Wyrds are mercenary psykers, self-taught individuals of wildly varied abilities who eke out a living as far from Imperial scrutiny as they can. The Inquisition is not the only group on the lookout for psykers, though. A number of fledging psykers are inducted into cults or other groups willing to hide them from the Black Ships' tithe. Psykers in league with the forces of Chaos are one of the greatest dangers the Imperium faces. Acolytes fighting rogue psykers who are allied with the Ruinous Powers face an enemy that may very well know what they intend to do before they can even enact it. Such opponents are willing to pull forth the secrets of the Acolytes' past in order to mentally violate them, making the fight against experienced psykers as emotionally damaging as fighting against Daemons. The

Inquisition is thus one of the foremost bodies of the Imperium for making use of Untouchables to serve the cause of the Ordo Hereticus in the capture and/or execution of rogue psykers.

# **Xenos Among Us**

The Ecclesiarchy preaches that it is the manifest destiny of the God-Emperor's Imperium to rule the entire galaxy and even those of more secular leanings believe this to be so. All other races are regarded as trespassing in humanity's space. The majority of humans that willingly deal with sentient xenos in any other than a violent fashion are considered to be heretics. Still, the scattered nature of the Imperium's many systems means there are a vast number of planets that bear xenoforms interlaced with those of humanity. While there are a few alien species that simply wish to be left alone, the greater majority ever encountered by the Imperium are all actively hostile to humankind. The Ordo Xenos is continually on the watch for the many threats posed by alien life forms, from deadly diseases to invasion forces. They must constantly guard against the sinister threats posed by alien-worshiping cults, Eldar raiders, the Great Devourer and the brutal Orks to name but a few.

A more insidious threat is present in the form of xenos technology. The more orthodox members of the Adeptus Mechanicus preach that all technology that doesn't derive from humankind is corrupt and capable of endangering its user's soul (at least, that's how they often justify their "requisitions"). Alien works are therefore often deemed suspect. Imperial propaganda generally depicts all items of non-human manufacture as inferior to those of humanity. If forced to acknowledge the efficacy of another race's technology, they swiftly forward the Mechanicus's arguments that xenos devices are all potentially damning. None of this changes the fact that a number of xenos artefacts are very powerful or can produce effects unknown to humanity's devices. Where there are illegal goods, there is profit to be had and a number of criminal groups throughout the Imperium deal in various xenos commodities, ranging from technology to drugs to slavery.

The Acolytes of the Ordo Xenos are forever on the watch for any signs of xenos influence. Cults dedicated to various xenos gods or venerating strange aliens themselves fall under their charter as do the many suspect criminal cartels and users of proscribed xenos technology. The agents of the Inquisition ceaselessly search for patterns when xenos become involved in any enterprise, because history has repeatedly shown that small intrusions often pave the way for full-scale invasions.

# **Rebellious Intent**

If they are able to do so, most of the Imperium's citizens seem to be content to go about their lives in relative peace. Many of the societies of the Imperium's worlds are oppressive though, which breeds resentment. Even the worlds that embrace a more egalitarian viewpoint frequently encourage conformity. Neither resentment nor forced compliance makes for contented people though. The Administratum, which runs the Imperium, is not unaware of this phenomenon. While planetary governors are allowed to run their worlds as they see fit, they are always encouraged to use the twin outlets of "faith" and "fear" as channels to redirect aggression. The Ecclesiarchy assists with the former, and constant vague rhetoric about the many threats of the galaxy helps with the latter. As long as

the Imperial tithes flow when needed, the Administratum often turns a blind eye to all but the most brutal of excesses. It is when the tithes end that the troubles start, for the Imperium does not suffer rebellion lightly. The greatest censure of an errant governor generally arrives in the form of an Imperial assassin, though larger rebellions frequently merit larger forces to put them down. Mutinous planets have been decimated as examples to others—yet rebellions, no matter how hopeless, will still occur, as defiance seems to be one of the defining traits of humanity.

Acolytes can find themselves involved in many different ways on either side of a rebellion. Some bands specialise in going undercover as they seek out particularly deadly threats lurking in the downtrodden shanties and seedy drinking halls. Some Radical Inquisitors may encourage rebellions (see **Chapter X: The Inquisition**) and Acolytes working for them may take up a career of rabble rousing. Neither supporting a rebellion, nor attempting to put one down, makes for a sedate life.

# **Burning Words**

There are many doors that should never be opened, some secrets that should be allowed to remain secrets. Nevertheless, there are various groups in the Imperium that seem determined to seek knowledge that has either been suppressed or deemed blasphemous. There are certain factions of scholars, often ones funded by the noble houses, which specialise in disciplines such as xenoarchaeology and psychic phenomena. As long as their findings are "approved", the Ecclesiarchy allows them to function with little interference, but a questing mind is seldom content with dogma and predisposed to stray into heretical thought. The followers of the Machine God are notorious for seeking out answers to forbidden questions, even when their superiors have forbidden them to continue down certain lines of inquiry. Finally, there are the more radical members of the Inquisition itself, who often consider themselves above the need to explain themselves or their reading choices. The Inquisition maintains a long list of heretical texts, many of which are to be burned unopened should they be discovered, that some individuals often treat as a "wish list".

Depending on the type of Inquisitor they're working for, Acolytes could find themselves involved in either the suppression of knowledge, its acquisition, or both. Stealing or destroying texts and data-files, pict doctoring, secretly corrupting the journals of soon-to-be-dead scholars so that their colleagues abandon certain roads of inquiry, record suppression, "fact" alteration, torching labs along with their occupants, searching for ancient texts—heretical or otherwise, are all distinct possibilities in the pursuit of guarding secrets. Remember that some knowledge is like a disease: once known it cannot be unknown no matter how badly an Acolyte wishes to forget what he has learned.

#### **We are our Own Worst Enemy**

The single most dangerous institution in the Imperium of Man is the Emperor's Inquisition. The greatest threat many Acolytes will ever face may very well come at the hands of a rival Inquisitor and his retinue. The Acolytes of the Inquisition are often the best at what they do: ruthless, dedicated and driven by the certain knowledge that what they do is right.

Trust is a luxury that Acolytes can seldom afford.

# **FOR GLORY OR GAIN?**

A Acolytes join the Inquisition for many reasons, but few ever manage to retire. Learning the dark secrets of the galaxy is not conducive to keeping one's sanity. Acolytes regularly face deadly foes, some of which are capable of rending not just bodies but souls as well. Why, then, do they walk into the darkness? Each answers for themselves alone. This section describes the rewards for PCs, as well as advice for how to hand them out.

# **EXPERIENCE POINTS**

Experience Points (xp) are the most common reward in Dark Heresy. Characters use them to buy Advances, Skills, Talents and Career Path changes, as this overall process represents the way they become more adept over time. As the GM you are responsible for awarding Experience Points. You want to give out enough to ensure that characters are progressing but not so much that they blow through their Career Path too quickly. There are several different approaches to handing out Experience Points; descriptions of these follow.

# **The Abstract Method**

This is the easiest way to hand out Experience Points and the one recommended for beginners. It has one simple guideline: give each player 200 xp for every four hours of play time. This represents the length of an average session, so this method ensures that after each game a player can take an Advance, or a new Skill or Talent.

While other methods are success-oriented, the abstract method is predicated on the notion that all experience is valuable. In fact, failure is often more instructive than success, so what matters is simple survival. If characters can endure everything the galaxy can throw at them, they deserve a reward.

The four-hour mark is a guideline and it is meant to be flexible. If your group spends a lot of time joking around, taking snack breaks and so on, you may decide that six hours is more appropriate. If your sessions average three hours, but are packed with adventure, that can deserve Experience Points too.

# **The Detailed Method**

As the name indicates, this is the most time-consuming method of handing out xp, but it also gives you the greatest control. When using the detailed method, you break the adventure down into its component parts and give out an xp award for the successful completion of each section. Essentially, each step of the plot has its own reward. Awards can be as little as 5 xp for a minor event and as large as 50 xp for a major one. When considering an appropriate reward for each scene, you can use **Table 8–1: Encounter Difficulty**. This breaks down each scene using the basic framework of the Test Difficulty table.

# **Example**

*In one session, the PCs followed a tip to find a seedy bar in the underhive. There they met an information broker who was willing to point them in the direction of a notorious smuggler, supposedly dealing in xenos weapons. First, however, the broker wanted the Acolytes to remove one of her competitors, and since he was a mutant, they agreed. She didn't bother to mention his well-armed gang. After dealing with the underhive scum, the characters finally acquired the location of the smuggler they'd been searching for. For this session, the GM awards 30 xp for finding and dealing with the information broker; 50 xp for the fight with the mutant and his gang; and 40 xp for determining where the smuggler was located. Next session they'll doubtless pay the heretical xenos-coddling scum a visit…*

| Table 8–1: Encounter Difficulty |          |  |
|---------------------------------|----------|--|
| Difficulty                      | XP Award |  |
| Very Easy                       | 20       |  |
| Easy                            | 30       |  |
| Routine                         | 40       |  |
| Average                         | 50       |  |
| Challenging                     | 80       |  |
| Hard                            | 100      |  |
| Very Hard                       | 130      |  |

As with Test Difficulty, you should try to be fair when determining encounter difficulty. Was the obstacle easily overcome or was the victory dearly bought? Were the PCs at a disadvantage (perhaps due to psychic ability or numbers)? How many Fate Points did they use to get through the fight? These are all questions to consider when assigning encounter difficulty.

You should also consider the importance of the encounter when awarding xp. Randomly killing innocents, or even the guilty, without purpose merits nothing; what matters is bringing heretics to face the Emperor's justice. The climactic encounter at the end of a long adventure, however, is worth extra xp, perhaps up to double the normal award.

# **role playing Awards**

In addition to story-based Experience Points awards, you may also want to hand out individual awards for good role playing after each session. role playing awards should generally be in the 20-50 xp range and they are by no means automatic. The idea is to reward players who do an exceptional job portraying their characters.

What "good role playing" is can be quite subjective. There is a temptation to reward the boisterous and entertaining player, but you should try to consider the personality of the character being portrayed. A brooding Adeptus Mechanicus enginseer is not going

to dominate social situations, but effective role playing of that personality is still worthy of an award. As the campaign goes on and the characters evolve, everyone in the group will gain a greater understanding of the personalities of the various PCs. This ought to make judging role playing easier.

# **Fate Points**

You may, on rare occasions, wish to award a Fate Point to an Acolyte who has accomplished something truly remarkable at the end of a major story arc, but you should be sparing when handing them out.

# **Rank & Privileges**

As Acolytes of the Inquisition, the PCs already have access to a great deal of worldly influence. Still, there are many groups that will not automatically kowtow to the Inquisition. Acquiring friends and allies within other groups such as the underworld or the Adeptus Mechanicus is always a useful "reward" for an Acolyte. Gaining fame and social status within Imperial society is a bit of a double-edged sword for an Acolyte—while useful, it makes their frequent task of going undercover somewhat difficult. Then again, such connections may make going undercover unnecessary.

Membership in exclusive groups and access to dearly held secrets are great rewards for Acolytes. The Inquisition has many forbidden books that only trusted agents ever get access to. Characters may also have greater resources allocated to them, allowing them to call in greater amounts of support without having to check with their Inquisitor first. A rookie Acolyte can muster almost no one but his immediate companions—having to fend for himself and earn the privileges long service and trust can bring. An Acolyte with a century of loyal service can ask for and expect to receive whole battalions of Imperial Guard if he deems a situation requires it.

# **Elite Advances**

Normally, characters cannot learn Skills and Talents that are not part of their Career Advances. This is intentional. If characters could pick and choose whatever Skills and Talents they wanted, the entire Career Path structure would break down.

That said, you may reward characters with special training that lets them buy Skills and Talents outside their Career Path, but this should be a rare occurrence. You also must make sure that characters justify these acquisitions through their actions. Characters must seek out teachers, spend time training and often pay exorbitant prices for the lessons. Even then, such Skills and Talents should cost at least 200 xp, if not more. You may relax some of these strictures under special circumstances, but don't make it too easy. Your players should never assume that they can acquire whatever Skill they want regardless of their career.

# **INTERACTION**

*"A suspicious mind is a healthy mind."* — Inscription within the Bastion Serpentis

M Much of Dark Heresy centres on dealing with the many and varied peoples that inhabit the worlds of the Imperium. From the lax guards that monitor the entrances into the underhive, to the quartermasters that portion out vital gear, to witnesses, contacts and spies, knowing how to deal with the peoples of the 41st Millennium can give you a decided advantage in rooting out and burning the heretics.

# Interaction Skills **INTERACTION SKILLS**

**Chapter III: Skills** presents a number of Interaction skills such as Charm, Command, Deceive and Intimidate. Each of these are basic Fellowship skills meaning any characters can employ them, albeit at a reduced rate if they don't have the Skill. To befriend another, a player would use Charm; to issue an order, he would use Command; to fool or dupe, he would use Deceive; and to frighten, he would use Intimidate. Together, these Skills offer the discreet tools for interacting with the people of the Imperium.

# Using Interaction Skills **USING INTERACTION SKILLS**

Usually, a player doesn't need to Test Skills to interact with other characters. He simply plays the role of his character. The interactions between the player, in the role of his character, and the GM, in the role of the NPC, determine the outcome of the conversation. As in any situation with dramatic consequences, though, a player should make an appropriate Test if there are consequences for failure, if he is trying to convince an NPC to do something that he or she would ordinarily not do: spilling information about a secret, accept a bribe and so on, or if success would advance the plot in a considerable way. Ultimately, when a player does or does not make a Test is up to the GM. He will have final say about the circumstances of the encounter.

# **Dispositions**

When Testing an Interaction skill, circumstances can dictate the Difficulty of the Test. Such situations include atmosphere, situation and an NPCs particular circumstances. However, the most important factor is the NPCs disposition toward the player character—how the character regards him and what feelings or lack of feelings the NPC displays. The NPCs disposition, which is always set by the GM, determines the base difficulty. Other factors can adjust the Difficulty up or down as the situation demands. **Table 8–2: Dispositions** provides sample dispositions based on the Test a player is attempting and the corresponding Difficulty.

On a successful Test, the target's disposition improves by one step, plus one step per degree of success. On a failed Test, the target's disposition remains unchanged and worsens by one step for each degree of failure.

Generally, a target must at least be Indifferent to do as requested, and then the target will only do what the player wants 50% of the time if left to his own devices. Each step above Indifferent indicates that the target is 10% more likely to do as requested. Under supervision, the base chance increases by 20%.

# **Example**

*Drake and his fellow Acolytes have conscripted a group of local PDF troopers to help them in their hunt for a dangerous xenos in the depths of an ancient hive. Coming unexpectedly upon the creature in the dank waste reclamation tunnels, Drake must try and get his cohort of suddenly reluctant PDF troopers to attack.*

*The GM decides that the PDF troopers are well trained but not happy about being seconded by the Acolytes. The GM classes their disposition as Resentment, so Drake will need to succeed on a Difficult (–10) Command Test. Drake needs to succeed on the Test to improve the troopers' disposition to Indifferent, but then the troopers might run away if the fight goes badly. Luckily, Drake has a 46 Fellowship. He rolls d100, getting a 25: a success! Since he passed the Test by 21, he also got two degrees of success, meaning he improves the troopers' disposition to Devoted, which the GM rules is more than sufficient to ensure that they will fight to the bitter end.*

# **Interaction and Groups**

When a player uses an Interaction skill against a group of individuals, he resolves the Test in the way already described, but the GM sets the disposition based on the overall attitudes of the group. The player makes the Test as normal, but if he succeeds, he can affect a number of individuals equal to his Fellowship Bonus. The total indicates the number of targets the player affects with his successful Test. Note that certain Talents can increase the number of targets a player can affect.

# **FEAR & DAMNATION**

The 41st Millennium is a dark and terrible place where mankind's billions inhabit a universe filled with unnumbered horrors and countless dangers. Murderous aliens stalk the cold stars, rebellion and treachery fester within the shadow of the Imperium's decaying might and nightmarish forces eternally claw at the very fabric of reality from beyond, seeking both to feast and to corrupt. The Acolytes must struggle against this backdrop of sinister menace, dark violence and entropy, and fear; horror, madness and the subtle taint of Chaos are fundamental aspects of the games you will play. T

The rules presented here reflect these many threats to the mind and soul, and how the player characters interact with them. They are separated into three distinct, interlinking sections: Fear covers a character's immediate reaction to frightening events and creatures, Insanity details with the long-term effects of mental trauma on a character, while Corruption deals with the insidious influence of the warp and forbidden knowledge. During combat encounters, the only rules that will be used from this chapter are those for Fear. the effects of Insanity and Corruption are dealt with in the aftermath of a battle rather than during it.

# **INSANITY AND CORRUPTION POINTS**

Insanity Points (IP) and Corruption Points (CP) are Characteristics that characters gain during play. Both of these scores begin at 0 when a player starts and increase over time as damage is done to a character's state of mind (IP) and the purity of his soul (CP). The higher these scores, the more twisted, damaged and debilitated a character becomes, and should either of these scores ever reach 100, a character is hopelessly driven mad or tainted and his career and life come to a sudden and abrupt end, exactly as if he had been killed.

# **FEAR**

Fear comes into effect when the Acolytes are confronted with scenes of atrocity or horror, or when they are called on to battle against terrifying aliens, insane perversions of science and nightmarish entities from the warp. When an Acolyte is confronted by such a frightening event or adversary, they must take a Fear Test; this is a Willpower Test, modified by how frightening the thing is. If the Acolyte passes this Test then he may continue to act as normal. If he fails however, he succumbs to Fear.

# **Degrees of Fear**

Some things are clearly more frightening than others; for an Acolyte, having a gun waved in his face by a ganger, although obviously dangerous, is not sufficient to call for a Fear Test. However, having a gun waved at him by the walking corpse of his dead brother, while luminous white spiders scurry in and out of his bloodless open wounds—that calls for a somewhat severe one. The **Table 8-3: Fear Test Difficulties,** offers some guidelines on the severity of Fear Tests.

| Table 8–3: Fear Test Difficulties |          |                                                     |

| Fear (4) Terrifying               | (–30)    | The King in Ragsand Tatters                     |

# **Failing the Fear Test**

If in a combat situation a character fails a Fear Test, he must immediately roll on **Table 8-4: The Shock Table**, adding +10 to the result for each degree of failure. The effects listed are applied immediately to the character.

If in a non-combat situation the character fails the Fear Test, the character becomes unnerved and suffers a -10 penalty to any Skill or Test that requires concentration on his part. This penalty lasts while the character remains in the vicinity of the object of their Fear (simply leaving and coming back again doesn't stop this!).

In addition, if a non-combat Fear Test is failed by 30 or more, the character also gains +1d5 Insanity Points.

# **Shock and snapping out of it**

Characters may be able to shake off some of the effects of Fear after the initial shock has worn off. Where specified on **Table 8-4: The Shock Table** that a character may "snap out of it", a character can make a Willpower Test when it is his next Turn. If this succeeds then he regains his senses, shrugs off the effects and may act normally from then on. If he fails this Test, the effect continues and he may try again when it is his next Turn.

## Table 8-4: The Shock Table

**Roll a d100 and add 10 for every degree of failure.**

- 01–20 The character is badly startled. He may only take a single Half Action when in his next Turn, but afterwards he may act normally.
- 21–40 Fear grips the character and he begins to shake and tremble. He is at a –10 penalty on all Tests for the rest of the encounter unless he can recover his wits (see **Shock and Snapping out of it, [page 232](#page-232-0)**).
- 41–60 Reeling with shock, the character backs away from the thing that confronts them. The character cannot willingly approach the object of his fear, but may otherwise act normally, with a –10 penalty on all Tests until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1 Insanity Point.
- 61–80 The character is frozen by terror. The character may make no Actions until he snaps out of it. After snapping out of it, the character will make all Tests with a –10 penalty for the rest of the encounter. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 81–100 Panic grips the character. He must flee the source of his fear, if able, as fast as he can, and if prevented from doing so he may only take Half Actions and is at a –20 penalty to all Tests. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points. Once away from the danger he must successfully snap out of it to regain control.
- 101–120 Fainting dead away, the character keels over and remains unconscious for 1d5 Rounds. Once he regain consciousness he is still shaken and takes all Tests with a –10 penalty until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 121–130 Totally overcome, the character screams and vomits uncontrollably for 1d5 Rounds. During this time he is helpless, may do nothing and drop anything he is holding. Afterwards, until the end of the encounter, the character may only take a single Half Action each Turn until he can rest. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 131–140 The character laughs hysterically and randomly attacks anything near him in a manic frenzy, firing wildly or using whatever weapon he has to hand. This effect lasts until the character snaps out of it, or until he is knocked unconscious. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 141–160 The character crumples to the ground for 1d5+1 Rounds sobbing, babbling and tearing at his own flesh, and may do nothing. Even after he returns to his senses, he is a complete mess and at a –20 penalty on all Tests until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1d5+1 Insanity Points.
- 161–170 The character's mind snaps and he becomes catatonic for 1d5 hours and may not be roused. The character gains 1d10 Insanity Points.
- 171+ The character is so affected that he begins to see strange and terrible visions as his hold on reality shatters. The character suffers the effects of "acute hallucinations" (see **Disorders, [page 234](#page-234-0)**) for 2d10 Rounds. After the hallucinations fade, the character will make all Tests with a –20 penalty while the encounter lasts. The character gains 2d10 Insanity Points and takes 1d10 points of permanent Willpower damage.

# **Very Bad Things**

Fear Tests in non-combat situations are very much the GM's call as to when and where they occur and should not be considered to be automatic. They should instead be used to build dramatic tension to your games, as their over-use will diminish their effectiveness and novelty, as well as grind down your Acolytes. That having been said, here are a few appropriate examples of events that can cause Fear:

**Disturbing** (0) Viewing the scene of a gruesome murder, minor unknown supernatural or psychic phenomena—strange lights, spectral voices, weeping statues, etc.

**Frightening** (–10) Meeting someone you know to be dead, being buried alive, major supernatural or psychic phenomena the skies raining blood, a painting forming shrieking mouths, etc.

**Horrifying** (–20) Sudden, shocking and inexplicable death (the man next to you on the shuttle suddenly dies, vomiting maggots), hideous moments of revelation (finding yourself covered in blood, surrounded by bodies with a meat cleaver in your hand and no memory of how you got there), the dead rising across a whole planet, etc.

**Terrifying** (–30) Experiencing a full-scale Daemonic incursion, discovering your failure is responsible for the deaths of millions, staring unprotected into the warp.

# Going Insan e GOING INSANE

Characters in Dark Heresy are at the centre of terrible events: battling indescribable horrors, uncovering shocking truths and engaging in desperate struggles where perhaps the lives and souls of countless innocents hang in the balance. Such are the stresses and terror involved that the slow slide into insanity is a constant threat. No human mind, not even one hardened by the harsh rigours of life in the Imperium, is immune to the slow erosion of sanity by the horrors of the 41st Millennium, and Acolytes are no exception.

In Dark Heresy these dangers are represented by Insanity Points. Insanity Points represent the strain put on a character's mind by his experiences; the more Insanity Points a character has the more fragile his mind. The cumulative effects of gaining Insanity Points are divided into Traumas, which represent the short term after-effects of particularly terrible experiences, and Disorders, which are permanent mental afflictions that sign post a character's slide into total madness.

# **DEGREES OF MADNESS**

A character is classified as having a certain degree of madness depending on how many Insanity Points they have. This classification gives a player a broad idea of the state of a character's mind and how close to the edge he has become. A character's degree of madness also determines the modifier that will apply to Tests taken to avoid Mental Trauma.

# **MENTAL TRAUMA**

Mental Trauma represents the relatively short-term damage to a character's state of mind that he suffers after experiencing a horrific or supernatural event. Each time the character gains 10 Insanity Points he must make a Trauma Test. This is a Willpower Test, modified in difficulty by how many Insanity Points the character has accrued in total (see **Table 8–5: The Insanity Track**). If the Test is passed the character manages to cope with his experience without extra ill effect. If the Test is failed roll d100, adding 10 for every degree of failure, comparing the result to **Table 8–6: Mental Traumas**. The result is applied to the character in the aftermath of any encounter that inflicted the Insanity Points on him.

# Gaining Me n tal Disorders **GAINING MENTAL DISORDERS**

Mental disorders reflect the permanent, long-term effects on a character's mind of exposure to things horrific and unnatural. A new disorder (or a more severe version of an existing disorder) is automatically gained each time the character has enough Insanity Points to increase his degree of madness by one stage as shown on **Table 8–5: The Insanity Track**. When a character acquires a disorder, the severity of that disorder will depend on his new degree of madness, as shown.

A character must have the preceding severity of a disorder for it to get worse, (so for a disorder to have become "Severe" the character must have the "Minor" version of the disorder first, with the exception of "The Flesh is Weak" that has no Minor version).

# **Example**

*Beam Rollings becomes unhinged after witnessing the horrifying Beast of Solomon. He already has a Minor Delusion of Invulnerability and so the GM decides to increase the level of the delusion to Severe rather than give him a new disorder.*

# **THE SEVERITY OF DISORDERS**

All disorders are rated as being Minor, Severe or Acute in ascending order of effect.

**Minor Disorder:** The effects of the disorder manifest rarely or are experienced only to a small degree. Any Test to overcome the effects of the disorder gain a +10 bonus. **Severe Disorder:** The effects of the disorder are stronger and may occur regularly. There is no modifier to Tests made to overcome the effects of the disorder.

**Acute Disorder:** The effects of the disorder are very strong and occur at the slightest stimulation. Any Test to overcome the effects of the disorder take a –10 penalty.

# **TYPES OF MENTAL DISORDER**

There is potentially no end to the variety of unpleasant and unwholesome disorders that might afflict a character, and a few examples are presented here. GMs should also feel free to invent their own to suit the individual Player Character and the horrors they undergo.

# **The Flesh is Weak!**

### **Seriousness:** Severe, Acute.

The character sees his flesh as weak and will constantly blame it for his failures and problems. He will also try to change and/or remove his flesh, becoming increasingly obsessed with surgical modification as well as bionic replacement.

# **Phobia**

**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character has a deep dislike and fear for a particular thing or circumstance. A phobic character must succeed on a Willpower Test to interact with the focus of his phobia. Enforced or gratuitous exposure to the focus of his exposure may incur Fear Tests. Examples of this disorder are:

# **Fear of the Dead**

The character has an abiding fear and loathing of corpses and the dead, possibly due to the fact that sometimes they don't stay dead…

## **Fear of Insects**

Scuttling things with many legs are the character's waking nightmare: faceless, numberless and hungry, forever hungry.

# **Obsession/Compulsion**

#### **Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character has a compulsion to perform a particular action or is obsessed with a particular thing. A character must make a Willpower Test not to act in a compulsive way or not pursue his obsession when the opportunity arises. Examples of this disorder include any of the following:

# **Kleptomania**

The character compulsively steals small objects if he has the opportunity. Often the character attaches no value to such objects.

# **Self-Mortification**

The character must scourge and whip his flesh on a regular basis (or after a particular event such as killing), in order to purge away the sin of his actions through pain.

# **Visions and Voices**

**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character sees things that are not there and hears things that others do not. Acute sufferers may experience visions into which they are totally immersed.

## **Dead Comrade**

The character hears the voice of an old friend now long-dead. At a Severe level, he may even have visions of his friend or converse with them, if his condition becomes Acute.

# **Flashbacks**

The character relives traumatic moments from his life. The length and vividness of these episodes vary according to the seriousness of his condition.

# **Delusion**

### **Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character suffers from a particular false belief that he has to act on as if it were the truth, despite his better judgement or evidence to the contrary.

# **Invulnerability**

The character believes that he will never get severely injured, either through luck or divine providence. Such a character would have to pass a Willpower Test not to enter a ganghouse and throw insults and punches instead of exercising due caution, for example.

# **Righteousness**

The character believes his choices are right and justified, no matter what the cost. Such a character might claim to be a Puritan despite using proscribed knowledge, or refuse to act subtly where it would otherwise be prudent to do so.

# **Horrific Nightmares**

# **Seriousness:** Minor, Severe.

The character suffers from vivid and reoccurring nightmares; trying to run from a black sun in the sky, or being imprisoned in an endless machine, for example. After any stressful day, the character must pass a Willpower Test in order not to succumb to his terrors while asleep. If he fails, the character will suffer from a single level of Fatigue (see **Fatigue, [page 200](#page-200-0)**) on the following day.

# **Only the**

# **Insane Shall Prosper…**

The more insane a character becomes the less horrific things seem. After all, what are the monsters of reality compared to those one sees whenever one closes one's eyes? If the first digit of a character's Insanity total is double or more a thing's Fear Rating (see **[page 325](#page-325-0)**) the character is unaffected by it and does not need to make a Fear Test.

# Removing Insan ity Po i n tsFr o m Your Character **REMOVING INSANITY POINTS FROM YOUR CHARACTER**

With the GMs permission, a character may use xp to remove Insanity Points. It costs 100 xp to remove a single Insanity Point. A character may never go down a degree of madness and so will never lose their disorders. All buying back of Insanity Points should be properly represented as time and effort spent by the character in game. Possible ways of representing the removal of Insanity are:

- Prayer, fasting, penance and mortification of the flesh.
- Long-term palliative care.
- Recuperation in quiet and pleasant surroundings.
- Contemplation of the great holy works or other articles of faith (the Credo Omnissiah for example for Mechanicus characters).

# **Example**

*Quinn Valentine has 21 Insanity Points and so will be unaffected by anything with a Fear Rating of 1.*

# CORRUPTION

The most insidious threat facing Acolytes in Dark Heresy, and indeed the Imperium as a whole, is the corrupting taint of Chaos. Encounters with Daemons, dark rituals and even the knowledge that such things are possible are all paths to corruption. Quite aside from the malevolency and manipulation of Daemons and their mortal followers, there is immense danger in exposure to the substance of the warp itself. The swirling tempest of psychoactive energies and pseudo-matter that make up the fabric of warp space is more deadly than any radiation. It can instantly destroy, but it can also inflict hideous transformations on material, body and mind, far beyond anything found in a sane universe. To most, corruption is a doom to be avoided at all costs, but some, once they find themselves walking the path to damnation, will seek to embrace the darkness.

# **CORRUPTION POINTS**

All Acolytes sooner or later gain Corruption Points (CP). Corruption Points operate almost exactly like Insanity Points, except that they are gained through exposure to the warp, dark rituals, cursed artefacts and Daemonic influence. The more Corruption Points a character has, the more afflicted he becomes; this is reflected in the rules by the risk of Malignancies and Mutation as shown on **Table 8-7: The Corruption Track**.

**Chaos and the Common Citizen** The rules for Corruption presented here are for use with Player Characters; Acolytes are men and women of destiny and purpose—exactly the sort of people that the Ruinous Powers seek to slowly corrupt and toy with. For most, the touch of Chaos brings summary destruction, madness, mutation and death.

# **MORAL THREATS**

The exact level of Corruption Points inflicted by a particular event, revelation or encounter is determined by the GM. The following presents some guidelines:

# **Warp Shock**

If a character suffers Insanity Points resulting from a failed Fear Test involving entities from the warp, the number of Corruption Points inflicted on him are equal to the being's Fear Rating score (i.e. Frightening 2 equals 2 CP).

# **Rending the Veil**

Characters caught in a full-blown intrusion of the warp into corporeal reality gain Corruption Points from the experience. Just how many depends on what occurs and the severity of the breach. This might be anywhere from a single point to several d10s in value.

### **Sorcery**

The practice of sorcery, witnessing dread rituals and invoking Daemons are all causes of Corruption, regardless of the reason. Normally minor rituals cause 1d10 Corruption Points and major ceremonies can cause many more.

# **Blasphemous Lore**

Knowledge itself can corrupt, and the study of certain tomes, pict-logs and even some debased artwork can cause Corruption in the viewer.

# **Dark Deeds**

Evil acts done in the furtherance of a malignancy, or in pursuit of forbidden lore, or done to appease a Daemon always cause Corruption Points.

# **Vile Persuasion**

Many Daemons and cult leaders are masters of insidious temptation and of sowing the seeds of doubt in a faithful heart. Their words and arguments can corrupt where force alone would fail.

# **THE MALIGNANCY TEST**

For every 10 Corruption Points a character gains, he must Test Willpower to see if his corruption has manifested as literal damage to his body and soul. This roll is modified depending on the number of CPs the character already possesses as noted on **Table 8-7: The Corruption Track**. If the Test is failed, the character's corruption of spirit is given form. These metaphysical and psychosomatic scars are called Malignancies, and are randomly rolled on **Table 8-8: Malignancies**. If a player rolls a result that he has previously suffered for failing a previous Malignancy Test, he must roll again.

| Table 8–8: Malignancies |                                                                                                                                                                            |  |

| 11–15                   | Dark-hearted: The character grows increasingly cruel, callous and vindictive. Reduce his Fellowship by 1d10.                                                               |  |

| 23–25                   | Night Eyes: Light pains the character, and unless he shields his eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty on all Testswhen in an area of bright light.                           |  |
| 26–30                   | Morbid: The character finds it hard to concentrate as his mind is filled with macabre visions and tortured,                                                                |  |

|                         | but perhaps enough to consign him to the stake if found out by a fanatical witch hunter. He must hide it well!                                                             |  |

| 61–63                   | Night Terrors: The character is plagued by Daemonic visions in his sleep. See Horrific Nightmares, page237 for details.                                                |  |
| 64–70                   | Poor Health: The character constantly suffers petty illnesses and phantom pains, and his wounds neverseem to heal fully. The character's Toughness is reduced by 1d10. |  |
| 71–75                   | Distrustful: The character cannot conceal the distrust and antipathy he has for others. He must take a –10                                                                 |  |

| 81–83                   | Ashen Taste: Food and drink hold disgusting tastes and little sustenance for the character, and he can                                                                     |  |

| 84–90                   | Bloodlust: Murderous rage is never far from the character's mind. After being wounded in combat, he must Test                                                              |  |

| 91–93                   | Blackouts: The character suffers from inexplicable blackouts. When they occur and what happens during                                                                      |  |

# **MUTATION**

A character's Corruption Points total is also used to determine the warping effects of Chaos upon his body. As his Corruption builds, his flesh may revolt, twisted by the Dark Gods. Of course, such is the insidious nature of Chaos that it is constantly hunting for weakness in mind and body, testing a character's defences until it can find a way into his soul. For every 30 Corruption Points a character gains, he must make a Test against two Characteristics of his choice or suffer a random Minor Mutation (see **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists**). He may not Test against the same Characteristics twice to resist mutation. A player should make a note on his Character Sheet of which Characteristics he has already Tested to resist mutation.

# **Example**

*Havelock has 31 Corruption Points and must make a Test to resist mutation. He chooses to Test against his Strength and his Fellowship, two of his best Characteristics. If he fails either roll, he will gain a random mutation. If Havelock reaches 61 Corruption Points or more, he will need to Test once again against two Characteristics of his choice to avoid mutation. However, as he has already used his Strength and Fellowship to resist mutation he may not choose either of these.*

# **THE DARK POWERS**

*"If you stare long enough into the warp, the warp will stare back."* — Navis Nobilite saying.

B Beneath the fabric of reality lurks the warp, a realm of unspeakable horror and maddening Chaos—a realm inhabited by the Dark Powers. Since time immemorial, man has believed in the existence of spirits, gods and Daemons: otherworldly powers to be appeased, feared and bargained with. In the darkness of the 41st Millennium, such things are all too real and find fertile ground to prosper in the souls of men.

The true nature of these powers can only be guessed at, their dark names whispered by traitorous lips into heretical ears. Most of humanity knows nothing of these powers, nor would ever want to. However, their influence cannot be denied. Of all the Dark Powers, the four Chaos gods, Khorne, Tzeentch, Slaanesh and Nurgle, cast all others into shadow.

# Khorn e **KHORNE**

**The Blood God, the Skull Lord, the Master of Battle**

Khorne is the Chaos god of murder, rage and war. His great brass throne sits atop a mountainous pile of skulls, rising above an endless sea of blood. He is the Hunter of Souls and Harbinger of War, driving the frenzied servants of Chaos before him. His glory can be found in the meat-rending explosion of a bolt

shell or the wet, tearing teeth of a chainsword. His followers exist only to harvest skulls for their dark lord.

# **TZEENTCH**

**The Changer of Ways, the Master of Fortune, the Great Conspirator, the Architect of Fate**

Tzeentch is the Chaos god of change, mutation and sorcery. He waits in a place where time runs soft and wax-like, psychic energy wreathing his head like liquid smoke. Father of paradoxes and master of intrigue, he twists the strands of fate to his unknowable ends, blessing his followers with arcane power and horrific mutations.

**SLAANESH**

**The Pleasure Lord, the Prince of Pleasure, the Despoiler** Slaanesh is the Chaos god of hedonism, temptation and excess. No pleasurable pursuit is too perverse for its followers. The Golden-Haired God watches over the writhing flesh pits and ecstatic rites of its slaves, urging them on to greater depravity and debauchery in his name. Under the gleaming gaze of the Prince of Lust, his servitors weave their wicked works, luring pure souls into heinous debasement.

# **NURGLE**

**The Lord of Pestilence, the Great Corruptor, the Master of Plague, the Fly Lord**

Nurgle is the Chaos god of decay, disease and entropy. Spreader of disease and Father of Decay, Grandfather Nurgle gathers all in his rotting embrace. His leprous kisses swell in the fullness of time, to glorious pus-flowers, the marks of his favoured children. His laughter echoes across the blasted battlefields of

the Imperium with only the bloated corpses of the dead to hear it.

**Table 8-9: Signs of the Dark Gods** details some of the colours, symbols, emotions and other aspects associated with each of the Chaos gods. GMs can use this information to add tell-tale details to locations and cultists, such as the eight brass rings that would be worn by a servant of Khorne or the great golden serpent sculpture that would dominate a Slaaneshi cult temple.

# **A Warning to the Curious**

The use of Dark Pacts in the game is optional and should be decided upon by the GM who always has the final say in their use and application. GMs should always consider their potential effects on their games and group, and whether they are going to handle them openly or secretly during the game. Players should never take the step of entering a Pact lightly and should always consider that, as well as offering benefits for a character, pacts also have very substantial liabilities and ultimately will probably destroy them. Despite their potential difficulties, Dark Pacts add a fantastic extra layer of intrigue and depth to the game, and they afford a treasure-trove of role playing opportunities, plot hooks, motivations and goals for Player Characters and GMs alike. They also offer a perfect accompaniment to the themes of Dark Heresy itself, where no one is immune to the lure of Chaos, not even the Acolytes.

It should almost go without saying that Dark Heresy is just a game, and as such is meant to be enjoyable fun. The things depicted in it do not exist. However, if you do not want your players to get drawn into the temptations of Chaos, steer clear.

# **SERVANTS OF THE DARK GODS**

The gods of Chaos interact with the materium through a myriad of warp entities and Daemonic servants. Taking many forms and guises, these creatures appear to mortals, spreading their taint throughout the worlds of the Imperium. Dealing with Daemons is a dangerous affair, as they are natural deceivers, quite capable of hiding their true master or even their Daemonic nature if it serves their own ends.

Most who seek the favour of these terrible beings inevitably fall into ruin and madness, their weak flesh twisted and their souls snuffed out, becoming little more than pawns in the Daemon's plans. Some, however, prosper in the dark light of Chaos, striking Dark Pacts with these creatures of the warp.

# **DARK PACTS**

There are numerous ways that Acolytes might take to make Dark Pacts. However, it is not simply enough to desire a pact with Dark Powers; you must also have an opportunity to make one. This can occur by a number of means such as the performance of a secret ritual, travelling to a particular accursed location or gaining possession of a particular item (or a combination of all three!). An Acolyte may discover these means quite coincidentally during the course of play (through items confiscated from cultists for example), or they may actively seek them out of their own accord. This search is never easy and a Forbidden Lore (Daemons) Test or

specifically applied Investigation skill Test is required. This quest should be handled in concert with the GM, and may indeed form a mini-adventure in itself for the character.

# **Pacts Sought After**

These are the classic circumstances in which Dark Pacts are made. Through the use of forbidden knowledge or dark myth, a Daemon or other entity is called on by a character and bargained with for power or aid. The more corrupted and powerful the character, the more likely their chances for success.

# **Opportunistic Pacts**

Often this takes the form of an approach by a Daemon to the character. This might be because of the character's level of Corruption (see **[page 238](#page-238-0)**) or because the GM deems it appropriate. Visions on the point of death, dream sending or a Daemonic visitation when a Psychic Power goes horribly wrong are all possible ways for such offers to be made. In these cases, the Daemon itself is trying to actively ensnare the character, and the Pact is almost certain to succeed if the character agrees.

# **Blasphemous Locations**

There are some places where the veil between reality and the warp stretches thin. In such places Daemons await and darkness listens; here forbidden rituals find favour and myths gather. Ancient ruins, sites of Chaos atrocity and murder, forgotten hulks and dead worlds once lost and saturated in the warp, all might provide locations where a character could lose their soul.

# **STRIKING THE BARGAIN**

Once the character has found the means to make the Pact, they must formulate and chance the bargain itself. What a player asks for from a Dark Pact should be based on their character's motivations for striking the bargain in the first place. The best thing is for the player to write down a list of "wants". These should be in broad descriptive terms and never involve specific game mechanics. Pacts should be about role playing and character goals and not naked power gaming (i.e. you may say "Grant me the skill and power to avenge myself on Vathek the Defiler and his murderous cult", but you cannot ask for a "+20 bonus in WS and BS and an extra combat Talent"). The trick here is for a player to keep his wants fairly easily expressed and clear. The more he demands, the higher the cost.

# **YOUR DEAL WITH DARKNESS**

Once the bargain is successfully entered into, the GM should either agree to your list of wants or offer their own counter-proposals on behalf of the Daemon. These, along with a descriptive set of costs which the Daemon imposes for its agreement, should be presented to the player. At the GMs discretion he may allow players to use Social skills such as Charm to try and gain favourable terms with a Daemon, though such Tests should always be Very Hard. Once an agreement is struck, the GM should work out the game effects they impose and what powers and effects (called boons) they will grant; the more powerful the aid, the more costly the bargain should be. A Pact may have more than one boon, but for each boon there should be an associated cost (see **Counting the Cost, [page 244](#page-244-0)**).

In order to help you out in crafting your own Dark Pacts, the section that follows provides extensive details on five iconic types of Dark Pact and their potential boons (which are by no means exclusive).

# **PACT OF SURVIVAL**

*"Release me from the weakness of this flesh and let me live!"*

Ironically there are those who are willing to bargain their souls to preserve their mortal lives, either through fear of dying or burning hatred for the living. Typically this Pact restores a dying, crippled or aged character to full health and vigour, and may grant additional boons of unnatural life.

**Infernal Vitality:** The character counts as having the Unnatural Toughness (×2) trait in the case of resisting poisons and diseases.

**Unsettling Recovery:** If the character takes Damage but is not killed by it, then he recovers from all Damage suffered within a day. Any effect of Critical Damage that do not result in the loss of limb or death turn out to be "not as bad as it looks". Remove all Damage and Characteristic Damage after rest. For a day or so, once healed, the character experiences vast hunger, especially for fresh meat.

**Leech Life Force:** The character can steal the life force of living things. When the character deals Damage using his bare hands (or teeth), he steals life energy from his victim. Any Damage he deals instantly repairs any Damage he himself has suffered. Excess points count as temporary Wounds, allowing the character to take more Damage than he otherwise could. A character with this boon cannot gain more than twice his starting Wounds. Temporary Wounds fade after one hour. In order to further this regrowth process, the character must consume a large amount of blood. In all cases, leeching life force is instantly and completely addictive.

**Timeless:** The character does not age and, if elderly, he slowly regresses physically over time to how he was when he was at his most vigorous. The character only needs to spend two Fate Points to avoid certain death, as opposed to burning one Fate Point.

# **PACT OF DOMINION**

*"Whether by fear or love I care not; so long as they obey me!"*

Of all the Pacts brokered with the warp, none is so common a bargain as that which gives the petitioner power over their fellow man. A character with such a Pact seems favoured by chance and destiny, and is meant for great things. He has the respect of his peers and those above him, and is preferred for promotion and recognition over his contemporaries. Even in the case of failure or folly, blame is more likely to be given to others or to circumstance than the broker of the Pact. For many though, mere favour is not enough and such a character will require more direct boons to master his fellows.

**An Eye for Weakness:** The character may Test Intelligence to discover with perfect accuracy whether someone is lying and to gauge their emotional state.

**Commanding Presence:** The character is always treated with respect by everyone he meets and never suffers a negative modifier to any Fellowship Test to Command, Charm or Intimidate others.

**Unquestionable Order:** The character may spend a Fate Point to make a command that must be obeyed if the subject is able and it is within their rational bounds. This is an order that the subject is inclined to follow without question, not mind control. So, for example, the character could order an elite guard to release a prisoner, but could not order the guard to shoot himself.

**Destiny Writ in Shadows:** Dark forces conspire to aid and protect the character. Every time the character spends a Fate Point, the GM makes a percentile roll. If it is less than the character's current number of Corruption Points the character recovers the Fate Point immediately.

# **PACT OF VENGEANCE**

*"Their destruction will be mine, whatever the cost!"*

When those who you hate are so protected it seems that they cannot be touched, what choice is there? This Pact sustains and empowers a character to destroy the specific target of his personal hatred. As such, a Pact of Vengeance must be made against a distinct group of people or a specific, named individual (such as, for example, all those who bear the blood of the Sinderfell family, the crime-lord Pater Telos or the cult of the Artisans of Pain). When rolling for Damage against the subjects of his vengeance, the character may always opt to reroll a Damage result, and may spend Fate Points to add 10 to the Damage. Additionally, this Pact might grant further boons.

**Death by a Single Word:** The character may once specify a single individual. The individual dies within 1d10 days, unless he is protected by superior powers.

**Whistle and I Shall Come:** The Daemon appears once when so called, and destroys the character's enemies. All the character must do is call when in the presence of the subjects of their vengeance. (See **Invoking the Daemon, [page 244](#page-244-0)** for more details).

**A Reckoning:** The character can specify a single person who is the subject of his vengeance and within a month events transpire so that he encounters them in person if at all possible.

**Dark Power:** The player may wish for strength and power to defeat his enemies by his own hands; this might mean Characteristic increases, gaining additional Talents and even acquiring new traits. If this boon is granted it should always have a heavy cost, or take a sinister and terrible form such as mutation or possession.

# **PACT OF DESIRE**

*"Grant me my heart's desire!"*

To obtain the seemingly unobtainable, there are some who are willing to traffic with dark things and make terrible bargains for what to others might seem vain and empty goals. But be careful what you wish for…

**Creating Perfection:** The character may specify a particular task that he wishes to undertake, such as sculpting a statue or writing a book, and succeed in it to such a degree that the result is "perfect". Given such perfection's source, however, the work may have unforeseen side effects, and may be too much for mortals to bear, irrevocably tainted or extremely dangerous (works of art that drive the viewer mad and the like).

**Goods & Chattels:** The character may specify something he desires, such as a particular object, fame, title, deed or wealth, and he comes into its possession, fate itself seeming to conspire to make it so. The exact mechanism of how this is accomplished is up to the GM, but as the boon is the gift of a Daemon, somebody, somewhere should suffer as a result.

**Mastery:** The character may select a single Skill over which he gains complete Mastery. From this point on, he never suffers negative modifiers when using the Skill. Also, if he spends a Fate Point, he automatically succeeds at a Test of this Skill.

# **PACT OF KNOWLEDGE**

*"Show me… everything!"*

Lust for knowledge may draw a character to forbidden lore and things that "man was not meant to know". From there, it is but a short step to desiring more such knowledge, blind to the price that he and others must pay. Upon the granting of this Pact, a character knows everything about a particular subject if that knowledge is knowable at all (enough to grant them a +20 bonus to the associated Skill). Alternately, there are other ways a Pact of Knowledge can manifest.

**Show Me:** The character gains the powers of a seer, and is able to see clairvoyant visions (of distant or hidden people, places, events and so on). These visions may be limited in scope to things present, past or of possible future, and by other occult factors. The more powerful the boon of vision, the more costly to the character it will be. The visions are always experienced in the same way, in a manner particular to the character, as images captured in a reflected surface or as a sudden painful delirium, for example. The character must spend a Fate Point to see such a vision wilfully.

**True Savant:** The character may make any Lore Test as if he has that Skill, and may re-roll any Test for a Lore skill that he is learned in.

**Monstrous Memory:** The character remembers everything and gains complete and perfect recall of his life up to that point.

**Knowledge Familiar:** The character is gifted a familiar that answers questions put to it with complete truth (although perhaps grudgingly). The familiar requires payment for each question asked before it answers. Payment varies but examples might include an eye or tongue, a piece of the questioner's flesh, or an object of beauty it might destroy. The familiar itself may be a conjured creature or may appear to be something innocuous, such as a small statue of black glass, a strange portrait or a clockwork artefact.

# **DARK PACTS AND CORRUPTION**

Entering into a Dark Pact is a stain on a character's soul that will never be clean again, and even attempting such a thing is an unforgivably foul act. Conversely, if a Pact is successful, the character will gain some small measure of control over the warp taint infesting him, and indeed will become less subject to its more minor effects.

A character that successfully enters into a Dark Pact gains +20 Corruption Points to a maximum total of 90 points. GMs may elect to increase this dependent on the nature and benefits of the Pact.

A character with a Dark Pact is shielded somewhat from the effects of petty corruptions and low levels of warp contamination after it takes effect. He halves the result of any randomly rolled Corruption Points inflicted on him (rounding fractions down).

# **THE MASK OF SEEMING**

Daemons mask their grip on their victim's souls, hiding the corruption within from prying eyes and psychic probing. Any attempt to ascertain the effects of corruption, warp taint or possession against a character with a Dark Pact by Divination, Psyniscience, or Telepathy suffers a -30 penalty.

# **INVOKING THE DAEMON**

In addition to the boons of their Pact, a character may seek to invoke his patron Daemon directly to appear and aid him; this is an act of desperation and incredibly dangerous. Invoking the Daemon requires the burning of a Fate Point and succeeding on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test. If successful, an incarnation or greater servant of the Daemon appears (treat this as an unbound Daemonhost), and the character gains 1d10 Corruption Points. The incarnation is more or less inclined to help the character, although the character has no direct control over it, and it will depart once the immediate encounter is over.

How fellow Acolytes react to this "help" is another matter.

# **COUNTING THE COST**

Dark Pacts always have a terrible price. GMs are encouraged to be creative with the costs the character must pay, both in terms of liabilities and the demands of his new patron. As a basic guideline, for each boon a Pact grants there should be a cost. Some basic examples of costs are presented here: in the first instance, service is a common feature of most Pacts; while in the second, fealty is the price of many Pacts that offer major power.

### **Service**

The character must serve his patron's needs and designs as best he is able, and the terms of this service should be laid down during the initial bargain, making the Acolyte in essence a double-agent for his new Daemonic patron. His Daemon may communicate its desires to the Acolyte at will through any number of occult and esoteric means, though his master's goals are far from transparent; indeed Daemons are inconstant and they fashion labyrinthine plots that few mortals can grasp. Worse, they ceaselessly war and scheme against their own hellish kind, and who better to persecute such conflicts than an Inquisitorial Acolyte whose allegiance has been turned?

# **Fealty**

The Acolyte has sold his soul to his dark patron to be collected upon his death. The light of the Emperor is denied him. Such characters gain no benefit from blessings, faith healing and other holy effects, nor regain sanity through prayer and fasting.

# **Sacrifice**

An initial sacrifice may be demanded by the Daemon before the Pact takes effect. This may take the form of an inflicted malignancy of a type favoured by the Daemon, periodic possession, or the death or betrayal of a companion or loved one. Alternatively, the Daemon might demand that the character perform some criminal act that suits its plans or successfully undertake a dangerous task in its service.

# **Observance**

The Daemon may require that regular rituals, oblation or other strange observances be performed in its name. Failure to do so will incur its displeasure.

# **DENYING THE DAEMON**

If you deny the Daemon its price after the bargain is struck, or betrays its interests, it violently withdraws its patronage, inflicting a malignancy and instantly undoing the Pact's boons. Daemons are spiteful beings and rarely simply kill those that have betrayed them, and the GM may wish to ensure that a complex and terrible vengeance ensues.

# **Masters of Corruption**

Many are the Daemons and dread entities that enter into Dark Pacts with mortals to corrupt and enslave them. Here are three examples:

**Balphomael:** Said to take shape as a great horned man as dark as the void with eyes of flame, this Daemon grants power, wealth, long-life and unnatural vitality to those hungry and ruthless enough to gain his favour. Souls are Balphomael's only currency, worship his due and murder his delight. Old myths, occult lexicons and forbidden records scattered across the Calixis Sector make much of the "horned darkness", and some whisper that many great and noble families owe their position to his shadowy ministry.

**The Lord of Misrule:** Tales of the Lord of Misrule are woven into the folklore of a dozen worlds, and the truth of his existence are shuttered in the proscribed vaults of the Inquisition. Fickle, manic and terrifying, the Lord of Misrule brings anarchy and madness in his wake. This strange figure is said to speak through the babblings of lunatics, the drunkard's slur and the last gasps of the dying. Appearing to those on the edge of death or who suffer as outcasts, only the most desperate take up his riddling bargains and those in his service quickly come to regret accepting his aid.

**The Dusk Hag:** On the accursed world of Dusk, a dark legend speaks of the Hag. Black Annaiys, Old Mother Ruin and a hundred other names she has, and if you should risk the journey into the deepest, most trackless swamps with hatred and desire burning in your heart, you might come to the black hollow where she dwells. It is said that her price is paid in flesh, sinew and bone, but her curses can strike death and terror worlds away, and all the secrets that men whisper in the night are hers. Just a legend perhaps, on a world shrouded in countless dark fables, but still petitioners seek her out and some return, maimed and mutilated, but filled with dark purpose.

# Chapter IX: Life in the Imperium

*"The martyr's grave is the keystone of the Imperium."* — *Liber Imperialis.*

T The Imperium of Man is a war-torn empire, teetering on the brink of collapse. For ten thousand years it has been ruled by the deathless Emperor, a being of incredible power, to whom thousands of souls are sacrificed daily. The peoples of the Imperium live in a place where Daemons are real, mutation is frequent and death is a constant companion. To be alive in the 41st Millennium is to know that the universe is a terrifying and hostile place. It is a place where you are but one amongst billions and, no matter how heroic your death, you will not be missed.

A truly vast domain, the Imperium is spread amongst the many stars of the galaxy. Its territories encompass untold millions of stars and countless more human lives. In its name, terrible wars are fought and desperate sacrifices made, yet even this river of carnage and blood is a small price to pay, for the Imperium is the guardian of mankind. Were it to pass into nothingness, so too would the human race, destroyed by enemies uncountable, to the laughter of the Dark gods.

# The Feudal Order THE FEUDAL ORDER

*"The Emperor asks only that you obey." —* Queen Coralie of Acreage.

The Imperium covers a wide area of galactic space, sprawling over countless worlds. There are few universals amongst these varying planets. Culture, language and even the human form appear in seemingly infinite variation across the universe. One of the few constants (at least amongst those worlds of the Imperium that are aware of its existence) is the network of feudal obligation and responsibility.

Each Imperial planet owes fealty to a planetary governor. This individual in turn renders to the Imperium's priesthood a tithe of men, materials and loyalty. The governor is also expected to reject enemies of the Imperium, and to ensure that the psykers upon his planet do not fall into witchery or possession. In return, the governor can call upon the priesthood (or Adeptus Terra as they are properly known) in times of dire threat and request aid.

The Adeptus Terra comprises a bewildering variety of departments, bureaus, sub-divisions and offices, each of which deal with a particular aspect of maintaining the continuity of the Imperium. Each order has an obligation to care for its given area of control. This weight of responsibility grows as feudal obligation passes up through a mind-numbing array of ranks within each Adepta. From lowly scribes computing a hive world's annual nutra-slurry yield to mighty sector commanders overseeing the assemblage of a crusading fleet, vassalage and power passes ever upwards to the titular heads of the Imperium, the High Lords of Terra. These powerful individuals rule from ancient Terra in the Emperor's name.

Based on Terra itself, the Emperor is a silent being of awesome power. His withered carcass is cradled within an arcane artefact of incredibly occult design. This Golden Throne, as it is known, sustains the Emperor's life force whilst He guards humanity from the Daemonic beings that would destroy mankind utterly. For hundreds of centuries He has fought this psychic battle and for hundreds of centuries mankind has offered Him their fealty, worship and devotion.

# **THE ADEPTUS TERRA**

The priesthood which serves the Lord of humanity is often referred to as "the right hand of the Emperor". It falls to the Adeptus Terra to interpret His will and minister to the Imperium. Many hundreds of thousands of souls labour across the galaxy to serve this vast organisation. There are numerous ancient institutions that make up the priesthood, each with various names on various planets. These varying Adepta, as they are traditionally known, each have a specific function to carry out in the Emperor's name.

# **The Adeptus Arbites**

# **(The Judges, Lawgivers)**

The Adeptus Arbites are the watchers of the law. It is given to them to maintain order amongst the higher echelons of Imperial governance wherever a planetary governor seeks to abuse his rule, wherever populist unrest seeks to unseat the

rightful dominion of the Imperium, wherever thoughts of personal gain at the Emperor's expense cross the minds of the ruling classes, there you will find the dogged agents of the Lawgivers.

# **The Adeptus Astra Telepathica (The Astropaths, Psykers)**

Blessed are the blind, for they have looked upon the glorious light of the Emperor directly and no true servant of the Golden Throne could ask for more. Through the agonising ritual of soul-binding, these psykers have been gifted with a small portion of the Emperor's incredible will. Thus protected from the worst evils of predation by warp entities, these unseeing servants of Terra can fulfil their primary function, preserving communication between the far-flung worlds of the Imperium.

# **The Adeptus Astronomica (The Beacon, The Light of The Emperor, The Ward of Man)**

The Black Ships bring thousands of psykers daily to the birthplace of man and many of those so tithed find themselves contributing to the vast psychic choir of the Astronomican. This steady beacon burns bright in the warp; it is the Emperor's will manifest, shining from Holy Terra, and guides Navigators across the Imperium. The process of lending their psychic power to focus the beam quickly leaves the choristers as lifeless husks, but they give themselves willingly, for without the Astronomican the Imperium would cease to exist.

**The Adeptus Custodes (The Guardians, Watchers of The Throne, The Thousand Companions)**

These are among the mightiest warriors in all the Imperium, the praetorians of the Emperor. They stand ever-vigilant outside the 
brazen doors which seal His holy chamber. They are entirely beyond reproach and they are among the few over whom the Inquisition has no power.

They never leave the inner sanctums of the Imperial Palace and serve from birth to death within its hallowed halls. Yet they are among the few of the servants of mankind who will ever look upon the Emperor directly, and for that they receive blessings beyond all measure.

# **The Adeptus Mechanicus (The Priesthood of Mars, Tech-Priests)**

The domains of the Adepts of Mars exist semi-autonomously within the Imperium, an empire within an empire, a right given to them by the Emperor Himself at the very dawn of recorded history. They are the guardians of technology, the magi of

machinery. It is theirs alone to know how to coax forth the life of a sun in a plasma containment field, how best to apply the blessings of activation and maintenance to the massive Titan war machines, how to ensure that the engines of the Emperor's starships run smooth and true.

The Adepts of Mars worship the Emperor in the guise of the Machine God. To them, mankind is in a fallen state that was at the height of its powers during the Dark Age of Technology, when the secrets of the universe were known to all. Knowledge then, lies in the past and the Adeptus Mechanicus will go to any lengths to uncover the great secrets of antiquity, scouring the universe for any scrap of information from their holy book—the Standard Template Construct system. They hold that, were the STC to be restored in full, it would reveal all of the powers of the hallowed past.

The Tech-Priests venerate machines and regard them as superior to flesh. Many of them believe that the Machine God desires them to shed this weakness and so they often sport numerous bionic modifications. These mechanical enhancements add to their air of otherness and further help to set them apart from the rest of humanity.

Through rune and hammer, the Tech-Adepts are the wards of the arcane and they guard their knowledge jealously. But for all their might, they are not beyond the watchful gaze of the Inquisition.

# **The Administratum (The Scriptists, The Enumerators)**

The huge Administratum sees to the running of the Imperium. Needless to say, its servants are legion. At the will of the Adeptus Terra, the Administratum collects the Imperial tithe, sends out colonists, mobilises the military, catalogues planets and much, much more.

Truly stultifying levels of bureaucracy exist within the Administratum and some wayward souls believe that the Imperium survives despite, rather than because of, its efforts. The Administratum has become synonymous with the Adeptus Terra in many places and, incorrectly, the terms are often used interchangeably. The faceless servants of the Administratum can be found all over the Imperium, ensuring that all things are accomplished in the correct manner, even if that may take a thousand years.

# **THE ADEPTUS MINISTORUM (THE ECCLESIARCHY, CULT IMPERIALIS, MINISTORUM)**

The Adeptus Ministorum is not formally part of the Adeptus Terra. Rather it is a sister organisation which works hand-in-glove with the servants of Earth. The Adeptus Ministorum derives its power and authority from the common belief in the Emperor's divinity. Also known as the Ecclesiarchy, after its chief high priest, the Ecclesiarch, the Adeptus Ministorum is vast and powerful. Its duty is to guide and interpret the innumerable ways that humanity has found to worship the Emperor, shepherding the myriad worlds of man along the unsteady path that lies between heresy and true devotion. Whole worlds lie within its administration and on many others still they are the most powerful Imperial institution.

Like the Administratum, the Ecclesiarchy is a complex and byzantine organisation. A bewildering hierarchy of priests, confessors, cardinals, novices, clerics, bishops and missionaries all owe fealty to the Ecclesiarch in his palace on Earth. Just as varied are the various roles within the Ministorum, from wandering missionaries, to charismatic preachers and theosophical scholars. Two of the most famous institutions within the Adeptus Ministorum are the training orphanages of the Schola Progenium and the battle-sisters of the Adepta Sororitas.

# **THE INQUISITION**

The Imperium is assailed by countless enemies both from within and without. The attentions of unclean xenos, the invidious influences of the misguided followers of the Ruinous Powers, planetary unrest, mutation, rogue psykers, rebellious Imperial lords and more all work constantly to bring the Imperium down, to the ultimate extinction of mankind. Yet somehow it survives and humanity endures.

The Inquisition is one of the many reasons for the persistence of man in a hostile universe. Known as the "left hand of the Emperor", the Inquisition operates across the Imperium and beyond to suppress and eliminate those forces that would destroy the holy dominion of mankind over the stars.

Inquisitors are empowered to go anywhere and do anything whatever they must to ensure the survival of the Imperium. Their Inquisitorial Seal opens all doors bar none, and even the vaunted planetary governors must acquiesce to their demands without complaint or delay, lest they be themselves regarded as suspect. They will commit acts, no matter how vile, to maintain the unchanging integrity of the Imperium, and they will put whole planets to death in order to see that this is so.

The members of the Inquisition vary enormously in physical appearance, methodology and mentality. Some operate alone and in secret, hidden from the eyes of the common man, while others operate openly and carry dozens of acolytes and agents in their cadre. What they do have in common is that they answer only to their Order, and each Order answers only to the Emperor. Their efforts can be checked by no Adepta and they are utterly, fanatically devoted to the defence of the Imperium. Even the most loyal and honest Imperial citizen is likely to break into a cold sweat on learning that the Inquisition is nearby—and that suits its members perfectly. For more information see **Chapter X: The Inquisition.**

Types of Planets

# Planets of the Imperium Types of Culture 

*"True faith is blind and justified."*

*—* Confessor Faust.

T The Imperium encompasses countless worlds. No one has ever been able to map them and no one can even say how many there are. Entire departments of the Adeptus Administratum are devoted to cataloguing the worlds in the Emperor's domains, a never-ending task, for it is in a state of eternal flux.

> Furthermore, the Adeptus Terra holds that the whole human race and the entire galaxy are under the Emperor's rule—the Imperium has a manifest destiny to unite mankind, impose its laws on every human world and destroy all alien life. The true scope of the Imperium is, therefore, the entire galaxy, though this is far from actuality. The Imperium jealously guards its territory whenever it can but its sheer size means that it cannot react to every circumstance. Many planets live and die alone, with only the truly great threats commanding the attention of the Adeptus Terra. Worlds are frequently lost to aliens, rebellion or disasters, with news of their destruction sometimes taking centuries to reach Terra. The Imperium's borders undergo constant change, with new worlds discovered, conquered or colonized and old ones lost.

# **TYPES OF PLANET**

The galaxy teems with worlds—gas giants, worlds of frozen methane, huge, globular masses of hydrogen that failed to become stars, and many more besides. Some of these are mined or exploited in some way, they may even harbor their own forms of truly bizarre alien life, but it is mostly upon small rocky worlds that mankind, and its enemies, are found. Within this category of world, however, are many variations and humanity endures all manner of environments in its quest to survive in a cruel and unwelcoming universe.

# **Language**

Low Gothic (also called Imperial Gothic or simply Gothic) is the "official" language of the Imperium, the tongue of its Adepts and of Terra. Most worlds have been a part of the Imperium for long enough to have adopted Low Gothic as a universal tongue but there are still a great many feral worlds on which Imperial Gothic is not spoken. Inevitably, dialects of Gothic differ from world to world and can be mutually unintelligible. Older planets frequently maintain archaic tongues of their own, to the extent that ruling aristocracies might only know enough Low Gothic to swear in. For highly formal matters, the Adeptus Terra use High Gothic, a precursor language of Imperial Gothic. Many Ecclesiarchy rituals, Administratum edicts and Imperial charters use this ancient and venerable language.

# **TYPES OF CULTURE**

Just as the people of the Imperium live in hugely varied environments, so too do their cultures vary immensely.

# **Hive Worlds**

The Imperium's most populous worlds are its hive worlds. The populations of these planets are so high that the people live in huge cities, truly immense manylayered structures that reach high into the sky, each housing billions of individuals. Hive worlds often provide much-needed

labour, their manufactoria producing mountains of war materiel and other goods to meet the Imperial tithe demands. Most hive worlds started out as relatively hospitable places but have become severely polluted, the areas outside the hives reduced to ash wastes or radioactive desert by the never-ceasing industry of the great cities. Equally dangerous can be the hives themselves. The crimeridden, poverty-stricken areas, almost always found in the most polluted and decrepit lower levels of the underhive, are home to violent gangs, criminals and assorted scum as well as mutants and heretical cults who hide there from the authorities.

# **Agri-Worlds**

These farming planets, in their own way, are as vital to the Imperium as its hives. These planets are given over entirely to the production of food, which hive worlds cannot produce in sufficient quantities to keep their huge populations from starving. Many a world has whole continents given

over to livestock or fields of crops. Some agri-worlds are covered in oceans teeming with fish and a few are far stranger—worlds covered in edible fungus, scoured by swarms of nutritious insects or gas giants home to flocks of flying creatures. A few planets are used solely to provide clean water to nearby hive worlds. Agri-worlds are sometimes ruled directly by the Administratum, to help ensure that their produce is grown and harvested with maximum efficiency.

# **Forge Worlds**

Much of a forge world is like an immense factory, with industrial complexes soaring into the sky and mine workings burrowing deep into the crust. Forge worlds build great numbers of complex machines, like tanks or spacecraft parts. They are ruled by the Adeptus Mechanicus, whose training and

research facilities are located there, along with the grand cathedrals to their deity, the Omnissiah, in which the Archmagi of the Tech-Priests enact the grandest, most complex rituals to honour the Machine God. The Adeptus Mechanicus' fleets, its tech-guard armies and, most formidably of all, the Titan Legions, are also all based on forge worlds. The forge worlds are sovereign ground and the Adeptus Mechanicus is loath to allow anyone on their surface other than Tech-Priests and the legions of menials who serve them.

# **Developing Worlds**

These worlds are split into geographical areas with widely varying levels of advancement and culture. Depending on the prevailing governments, these might be countries, states, power blocks or tribal homelands. It may be the case that higher levels of technology and

wealth are concentrated around original colonisation sites. Other planets might exhibit gross variations in culture due to environment, with areas weak in natural resources being similarly weak in terms of military power, economic muscle and so on. Some planets preserve a great divide due to ancient tribal taboos, religious notions or plain old-fashioned habit. A great many worlds of the Imperium fit into this broad category, but no two are alike in the way they realise these divides.

# **Feudal Worlds**

These planets are populated by folk who have lost access to all but the most basic of technologies. Farming, simple machines such as pulleys, windmills and the like are known, but propelled flight, automatic weaponry and even powered vehicles are likely to be rare

or non-existent. These worlds are often said to be the most politically harmonious of all the planets of the Imperium, because their peoples know their place.

# **Feral Worlds**

These worlds are populated by tribal peoples largely living without the assistance of maintained technology. This may be due to a failed colonisation project, religious preferences, cultural choice, environment or some other reason. They may be aware of the Imperium in some fashion but are

unlikely to know much more than something about a large group of distant people living in the stars. These planets are frequently unsuitable for later colonisation, either due to the circumstances which drove the natives feral or because the natives themselves actively resist new people settling on their lands. People of feral worlds can range widely in culture, from Grox-hunting tribes of ancestor worshippers to wild-eyed, post-apocalyptic road warriors, fighting endlessly amongst the toxic, sand-strewn ruins of their civilisation.

# **Shrine Worlds**

These worlds are dominated by religion and acts of devotion. It may be that these places saw the birth of a famous saint or formed the battleground for a particularly important war. Often studded with temples and shrines, these worlds are frequently controlled by the Ecclesiarchy

and may form training grounds for members of their Adepta.

There are also the dark mirrors to these places of Imperial devotion—fallen worlds where the inhabitants offer up ceaseless prayer to the Dark Gods. These places of obscene sacrifices and bloody rites are not suffered continued existence for long.

# **Quarantined Worlds**

The existence of these planets is rarely made obvious but there are many of them throughout the Imperium. Travel to these worlds is forbidden except for the most well-informed and heavily armed expeditions, and even then only with a very good

reason. Death worlds, alien empires or planets where the creatures of the warp have broken through into realspace are all examples of quarantined worlds, as are planets wracked with plague. Some worlds are quarantined because no one can fathom the origins of what has been found there, be it mysterious artefacts or ancient cities—it is thought better to live in ignorance of what lies on such worlds than risk it becoming a threat. Other worlds are quarantined because every expeditionary mission there has failed to return. Planets are often quarantined by the pronouncements of Inquisitors, especially if they have uncovered some warp taint or xenos infestation that cannot be cleansed. Many quarantined worlds possess great resources that would be extremely valuable to the Imperium if they were properly explored and exploited, but there are enough tales of ancient horrors awoken on sinister alien worlds that few adepts would try to defy a planetary quarantine.

# **War Zones**

There are a great many worlds in the Imperium that can be classed as war zones. The Imperium is constantly at war and in those wars whole planets can burn. Massive campaigns can envelop dozens of systems and hundreds of worlds, many of which are utterly devastated by orbital bombardments and artillery in planet-spanning battles that last decades. Long-term war zones are hellish places where death comes quickly. The Imperium can field truly immense armies of millions of men, grinding their way across a devastated planet and reducing cities to rubble. Mercenaries flock to such places, hoping to leave soon after with their ships loaded with pay. Deserters and escaped prisoners form bands of pirates, preying on any ships unable to defend themselves or roam the war-torn planets in feral packs stealing and killing. The Administratum sends colonists from overcrowded worlds to populate war-torn worlds after the fighting has ended but the wheels of the Imperium grind slowly and a world can lie devastated for centuries before any effort is made to resettle it. These places can be some of the most ghastly in the Imperium, with ravaged environments, cracked planetary crusts, burnt-out cities and plains covered in the bones of the fallen.

# **PLANETARY GOVERNMENT**

Just as the environments and cultures of Imperial worlds vary, so too does the way they are governed. The Imperium allows most of its worlds to govern themselves, using whatever method of government the population gravitates towards. Some are hereditary monarchies, others ruled by aristocracies or warlords. Some are ruled by elected parliaments, while on others power is given to whoever can pay for it. On some worlds these are the same thing. Upon other planets, such things as democracy, free choice and even personal rights are present, though these are few and far between. Some worlds are administered directly by the various Adepta, such as agri-worlds run by the Administratum or cardinal worlds ruled by the Ecclesiarchy.

Whilst the individual countries, states, tribes, corporations, hegemonies, peoples' work collectives, and so on, may have their own various leaders, the Adeptus Terra will look to one person to fulfil the planet's tithes and obligations to the Imperium. Titles for this governor vary from planet to planet. In some cases the person judged responsible for the tithe may not even be aware that this is the case until too late. Certainly, more than one titular head of state has discovered this upon rejoining the Imperium after a period of isolation through warp storm, war or other calamity.

All governors are expected to recognise the authority of the Imperium and to uphold its laws. These responsibilities include aiding the agents of the Adeptus Arbites and the Inquisition, as well as arranging the allotted tithes for the Administratum. Governors are also expected to yield psykers up to the Black Ships of the Inquisition when required and to keep the population free of mutants, cultists, radicals and witches. In practice, some planets escape from these duties with relative ease, whilst others are placed under seemingly tyrannical restrictions. Due to the sheer size of the Imperium and the unpredictability of travel, there are many occasions where the Administratum never manages to extract its levy, or the Black Ships never arrive to take psychic individuals away. Planets can be isolated for generations and it is not unusual to encounter worlds where the Imperial tithe has been all but forgotten. Certainly the scribes of the Prol System have, in their vast libraries, several accounts of Administratum logisters arriving at worlds lost for centuries, only to discover their yearly tithe burning on vast pyres as the natives offer their dues up to the sky.

In some cases, a group of planets might have enough contact with one another to form political alliances and even minor empires. Other clusters of worlds might be connected by huge corporations, the powers of hereditary nobles, religious leaders or other such ties. In such cases, planetary governors must not only tend to the needs of the Imperium but also the whims of these power blocs.

# **Psykers**

Humans with psychic powers, from telepathy to pyrokenesis, have existed since the dawn of mankind, but their position in the Imperium is uncomfortable at best. An untrained psyker is an unguarded gateway to the warp, through which psychic predators can enter realspace and wreak havoc. It is said that whole worlds have been lost to hideous monsters of the empyrean, while rogue psykers have committed horrible crimes with their powers or led dangerous and destructive cults. On some worlds all psykers are tried as witches, subjected to tortuous ordeals and burned at the stake when their inevitable guilt is proven. Imperial law requires all worlds to monitor its psykers and subject them for testing by the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. Those who are strong enough to withstand the perils of the warp are trained to serve the Imperium. Those who are too weak are taken away by the Black Ships and never seen again.

# **PLANETARY APPEARANCE**

The peoples of the Imperium vary in their form just as their home worlds do. Whilst there is a generally agreed human standard, consisting of four limbs, one head, twenty digits and so on, local environment and genetic stock have caused all manner of interesting anomalies, evolutionary adaptations and fashions. These differences are usually cosmetic in effect; however, the more radical alterations walk the line between accepted variation and outright mutation. It is a subject of intense debate amongst some Inquisitors, and indeed the Ecclesiarchy, on what it is to be human and therefore accepted into the Imperium.

Certain planets will betray their colonial origins with the appearance of their peoples—perhaps a particular type of nose or skin colour will be dominant. Others will have clear tribal divisions. Some populations will possess unusual adaptations as a consequence of their environment. The folk of the agri-world Dreah, for example, have a grey skin, hair and eye tone, which exactly matches the flora, fauna, sky and waters of their notoriously dull planet. Some cultures may impose certain ideals of beauty that drastically alter the looks of their peoples. Certainly, many strange and terrible gangs of underhivers have been discovered, clad in hyper-fashionable armor, sporting glowing electoos, skull studs, gang mutilations and shiv scars with pride.

To some extent a similar appearance and culture binds the people of a planet together into a common stock. Usually speaking, citizens of the Imperium will prefer to spend their time with fellow natives of their world. That said, however, man has ever been titillated by the exotic, so friendship, love affairs and even children with off-worlders is not unknown on planets with a culture of such travel.

"For the warp is a strange and terrible place. You might as well throw a traveller into a sea of sharks and tell him to swim home as send him through the warp unprotected. Better it is not to let common man travel through the stars. Better still, let him not know such a thing is feasible."

> Fra Safrane, 5th aide to Navigator Da'el. Comment made prior to the departure of the second mission to search for the missing freighter 'Pride of Angelus'.

"The Revered Houses of the Navis Nobilite are one of the bastions upon which the Imperium is founded and the institution claims it can trace its ancestry back to the birth of our Great Empire.

The Great Families of the Navis Nobilite are uniquely composed of a particular form of human called a Navigator. Tech-adepts have speculated widely over the development and nature of the Navigators' unusual talents and many cast hints at shadowy genetic transmutation and interbreeding during the founding of the Navis Nobilite. Whatever their origins, the Navigators today are a glorious and esteemed organisation, loyal to the Imperium and stalwart in their faith. The peculiar powers of the Navigators can only be preserved by intermarriage; breeding with mundane humans eliminates the special abilities. This factor has led to the development of the closely-related Navigator families and the Navis Nobilite as a whole."

> Preface – Historia Et Structura Res Navis Nobilite

# Travel in the Imperium

*"You cannot fathom the mysteries of the Universe, you must simply trust in the righteousness of the Emperor's Command." —* Edicts of the Navigator Guild Calixis.

Travel between the worlds of the Imperium is rare and dangerous. The vast majority of civilians will never know the roaring tedium of shuttle flight, the sickening plummet of a drop pod or the unnerving silence of deep space. Given the huge size of the Imperium, it is impossible to cross it in the fleeting span of time given to ordinary men. Colonists, pilgrims and refugees spend many generations in the vastness of space, and many ships never survive the vagaries of travel to reach their destination. Some have theorised that the universe actively resists mankind's crude attempts to explore its mysteries. The darkness between the stars keeps its secrets close and yields them to inquisitive humanity only rarely.

# **SLOWER THAN LIGHT TRAVEL**

Used mostly for journeys between planets or closely neighbouring systems, slower than light travel involves speeds that confound mortal imagination and yet are still nothing when measured against the sheer size of the

Warp Trave l TRAVEL IN THE galaxy. Those attempting to use slower than light drives to travel any appreciable distance condemn themselves and their descendants to a shipboard life, endlessly whittling away the years until they arrive at the distant star they set out to reach.

> The average citizen is unlikely to experience slower than light space travel. Even those individuals living within a system with plentiful ships for interplanetary travel are likely to prefer the world of their birth over distant places with strange customs, odd food and "funny-looking" people. In many places, space travel is reserved for the privileged few who can afford to maintain the rituals, priests and shrines that such craft require, as well as the vast cost of the ships themselves. Tech-Priests do what they can to sate the spirits of these craft, but often even their unfathomable lore is not enough to prevent these temperamental ships from venting their rage (and oxygen) to the detriment of passengers. Sheer odds dictate that sooner or later those that frequently travel in ships between planets will experience such a disaster.

> Those worlds that have not lost the art of creating and maintaining slower than light ships jealously guard their arcane craft. This reluctance to share their guild secrets ensures the reliability and price of their vessels but also robs others of vital information required to placate their own craft.

> Institutions such as the Imperial Navy, Inquisition and various Adepta have access to much better-quality vessels, maintained with religious awe and reverence by countless generations of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

 The Chartist Captains

The space lanes of the Imperium are plied by huge, often ancient, merchant ships commanded by the Chartist Captains. Lacking Navigators or Astropaths to guide them, these civilian craft take years to travel their circuitous routes between the stars, trading and bringing supplies to worlds which need them. The ships of the Chartist Captains are the only contact many worlds have with the galaxy at large, and to some primitive worlds their arrivals are long-prophesied events of great spiritual significance. Similarly, the reports of Chartist Captains are the only evidence that many worlds still exist at all. The route of each ship, set down in its charter written up by the Adeptus Terra, can take generations to complete and a Chartist ship is home to a spacefaring community of "void born" souls who can live and die without ever setting foot on the surface of a planet.

# **WARP TRAVEL**

To move any appreciable distance within the Imperium, voyagers must resort to warp travel. This method of faster than light travel is rare, expensive and dangerous, as it requires the use of the unpredictable realm known as the warp, or immaterium. Vessels equipped with a functional warp drive are able to translate themselves into this other dimension of being by generating an envelope of Geller fields. These quixotic waves "bend" the ship through the veil of realspace into the immaterium. Once within this strange place, the ship is able to ride the currents and eddies that flow within the warp, frequently dropping back into realspace to check its positioning.

The immaterium is a bizarre and contradictory place, entirely unnatural to mankind. Looking upon the warp unprotected causes madness and corruption, and thus is greatly feared by almost everyone. Dimensions, colours, forces and emotions operate entirely differently within the warp's embrace, and this can drive even the most thick-headed crewman insane. Psykers of course, find such travel even more disturbing as their mystical senses are able to comprehend much more of the immaterium and the foul creatures that dwell within it.

Those that travel through the warp emerge to discover another of its disconcerting effects. Time does not operate normally within this other realm and so travellers can emerge to discover that centuries have passed since they started their journey, that they have merely been absent for a few seconds, or have even arrived before they left. Even skilled Navigators cannot predict how much time will be lost, gained or repeated over the course of a journey. Those that embark upon warp travel know that they will probably never return home, or that if they do so they will find it so changed that it is unrecognisable. When two or more captains of ships meet, they invariably trade dates, attempting to reconstruct the time they are missing or have gained. Needless to say, warp travel is not embarked upon lightly.

The warp is occasionally prone to great turbulence or storms of activity. These strike at random and last for an unpredictable amount of time. Whilst these storms rage, any vessels within are tossed about on roiling currents, sometimes being spat out at random locations. Other ships simply become trapped, unable to translate back into realspace, cursed to an eternity upon the waves of the warp. These storms disrupt communication across the Imperium and can sometimes herald a great disaster within realspace.

Navigators

The Navis Nobilite, or Navigators network of extended families , form a sprawling Navigator gene , all of which bear the . Navigators are different to other men, with some seeing them as mutants, but their differences are stable and, unusually, are not only tolerated by the Imperium but are essential to its very existence. A Navigator possesses a third eye in his forehead through which he can perceive the warp itself and read its currents and eddies. For anyone else to look upon the warp would be to invite madness and possession Navigator's power allows him to guide a ship through the , but a warp and reach its destination far faster than any ship could travel without him. Navigators use the great psychic beacon of the Astronomican as a fixed point to aid their route-finding. In this way they are able to complete a journey with far fewer drops into realspace to plot position. The great majority of Navigators serve in the Imperial Navy and many Navigator families are tied to Naval aristocracies by complex bonds of honour, debt and patronage.

# **COMMUNICATION**

Just as travel within the Imperium is a complicated and inexact science, so too is the business of exchanging messages between the many and varied planets that make up the Empire of Man. Planetary communications systems such as vox-casters, hardwired lines and the more advanced vox-communicators suffice to pass messages amongst the nations of a world, yet have almost no use beyond the bounds of the planet's surface. Such devices require many years for their signal to reach even the nearest planet and have no surety of even being detected when they arrive. The perils of travel ensure that human or servitor messengers are just as unreliable and potentially as slow as radio or other energy wave communications.

The Imperium then, is forced to rely upon communication by psychic, or astropathic means. Astropaths communicate with symbols and iconic images, projecting these messages through vast distances of space by means of psychic power. This process is usually exhausting and requires ritual and focus in order to keep the pskyer in the right frame of mind. These can take a wide variety of forms, such as use of the Emperor's Tarot, vision quests, automatic writing, trances, séances and the like. The Gaolist Astropaths of Hredin for example, spend many years etching their messages onto painstakingly illuminated sheets of iron and then destroy the work of art upon a massive grinding wheel. The pain of annihilating a much-loved labour is said to produce psychic messages of unparalleled clarity.

These messages are received by fellow astropaths in various ways. Some appear as vague and troubling dreams, whilst others appear as visions or mystic portents. Others appear within whatever ritual method or divination technique the receiving psyker happens to practise. Thus warning of an Ork invasion might appear as a glistening imperfection in fish entrails, a looming cloud of smoke, bleeding orifices or a worrying combination of runes or sigils within a holographic matrix.

These messages must not only be transmitted from one astropath to another but decoded at the other end. Each astropath employs slightly different symbols and each has a preferred style or "flavour". Some messages take weeks of poring over tomes of augurs and symbolism before they can be reconstructed, though the best astropaths can do this word for word. Some remain a mystery forever. Some messages are received by astropaths at entirely the wrong end of the galaxy and must be passed on to others who are nearer the place in question.

Some messages simply do not get to their intended recipient or are drastically misinterpreted along the way. In addition, there are too few astropaths. Most worlds, especially those with small populations or on the fringes of the Imperium, have no astropaths at all, and must rely on the infrequent visits of passing Chartist ships or Administratum census-takers to make contact with the outside galaxy at all. For this reason the Adeptus Terra cannot react quickly to every event in the Imperium, even when an event occurs that is great enough to attract the notice of the vast and ponderous bureaucracy. On most worlds, the Imperium feels very far away.

# **THREATS TO HUMANITY**

*"Beware the enemy within! Scorn the enemy without! Fear the enemy beyond!"* — Excerpt from *The Acolyte's Oath*.

P Perversely, for the largest empire that humanity has ever known, many planets within the Imperium feel isolated and alone in the long night of space. Across all the peoples and planets of the Imperium, fear gnaws away at the psyche, worming mistrust and desperate faith into the conscious and unconscious mind. Time and again the universe has proved itself an uncaring and frightening place. People sicken, the warp rages, xenos attack and worlds die. The people of the Imperium watch their neighbours for signs of heresy and witchery. Mankind prays to the Emperor to protect them from the woes of the universe, of which there are many.

# **DISCIPLES OF THE DARK GODS**

Time and again, the minds of man have proven fertile soil for the seeds of corruption. There are certain dark powers abroad in the universe that seduce the weak and foolish into their damnable service. These ageless beings, their names unspeakable, prey upon mankind's needs and desires. With honeyed words, forbidden knowledge, bloody rites and festering secrets they lure humanity to become their slaves.

Some within the Imperium choose to worship these Daemon gods. The ways of these cults are many. Some meet in clandestine rituals of sacrifice and incantation. Others are foolish scholars, meddling with powers beyond their ken. Others still are organisations, companies or political groups drunk with power gained through pacts with unspeakable creatures of the warp. Perhaps worst of all are the instances of entire worlds that worship the Chaos gods through ignorance or choice. All of these profane cultists invite ruin upon themselves, the Imperium and humanity.

The Adeptus Terra, planetary governors and the Inquisition watch for these disciples of Chaos, for the inevitable consequence of their meddling is pain, disaster and blood shed. The ordinary peoples of the Imperium rightly fear these cults and their malevolent masters. On many worlds an undercurrent of paranoia, suspicion and fear of Chaos cultists is the norm.

# **MUTATION**

The degeneration of the holy human form is one of the Ecclesiarchy's greatest concerns. Environmental pollution, deliberate genetic alteration, stellar radiation, alien diets and simple evolutionary adaptation have wrought manifold changes upon the physique of man across his empire of stars. Some of these mutants have a standard, stable, morphological type and are tolerated by the authorities—notable among them being the abhuman Ogryns and the ancient and noble Navigators. But to find whole worlds where the population has no eyes due to never-ending darkness, or unusually long legs because of millennia of nomadic living, is not unusual. Whether these aberrant populations are declared acceptable or not is the business of the Adeptus Terra.

But mutation can also be a sign of the Dark gods. Just as they twist and destroy the minds and souls of man, so too do they toy with his flesh, bending it into profane shapes, gifting strange abilities and creating monsters for their perverse amusement. Where such mutation is present, it is rightly abhorred. Few are willing to tolerate such a aberation within their midst and fear of mutants runs through the populations of many worlds, even those

where such things have happened but once in a hundred generations. Perhaps worse still is the constant fear of becoming a mutant oneself. Many folk pray that should this worst of all things occur, they will have the strength to end their own lives, before the mob or the Inquisition does it for them.

Some poor fools are willing mutants, seeing the distortion of their flesh as a sign of favour from the Dark gods. They seek out ways to gain more of these gifts, either by begging the Daemon gods for more of their touch or by doing their bidding in the hope of reward. Others, more poignantly, claim innocence of any wrong doing or foul worship. Whatever the case, a mutant is a mutant and must be feared, hated and destroyed. This is but one of the many reasons Imperial citizens tend to be highly intolerant and many innocent men, upon finding themselves on a new world, have been murdered by a frenzied mob for merely appearing to be different.

On WitchcraftThe question of witchcraft exercises the minds of a great many of the Emperor's servants. Indeed, one whole arm of the holy Inquisition Ordo Hereticus—has the finding and destruction of these dangerous beings as one —the of its primary activities, and several other organisations exist to contain, exploit and control these human psychics.

It is said by a heretical few that mankind stands upon the brink of an evolutionary change, that every year the incidence of psykers rises and that one day the entirety of mankind will become a new, psychic race True or not.

 , the psykers of the Imperium are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they enable the continued existence of the Imperium—the astropaths, the seers, Imperial psykers, the savant battle-psykers of the Guard the Space Marines , the Librarians of , even the Emperor Himself—these loyal servants of mankind are psykers all , good and necessary . Yet they are few in number and for every mind that is strong enough to stand against the perils of the warp hundreds of others whose minor gifts , there are , whether they seem a boon or a burden to the individual, are a clear danger to the worlds of man lead to intrusions into the physical universe by warp entities or leave the individual.

Concerning The Three Great Threats To The Safety Of Man On Daemons

On Daemons we shall not dwell here, for the very existence of such fell beings is a terrible secret and must be hidden from the minds of those who would fall prey to them. A Daemon is a warp entity, a terrible creature of thought and energy brought forth into existence by the twisted needs of sentient beings, or at least so the high masters of the Ordo Malleus say. To even think of them is to invite their attention and only the steeliest mind, the most powerful faith, is enough to overcome their utter, monstrous evil. Inconceivable as it may seem, there are those who would consort with the Daemon, for they whisper dark things in the night to those who would listen and make many promises of temporal or eternal power. They can be brought forth willingly, by the witch or by certain arcane sorceries, or they may try to force a way through into the world through the unsuspecting portal of an untrained psyker's mind. However they become incarnate, if they achieve their goal, just one Daemon can bring ruination to all it encounters. One need not talk of the Night of Silence in Atraxian III's capital, nor of the lost world of Abandoned Hope, which to this day is warded by the Inquisition, knowledge of its existence forbidden to all. Make no mistake, to face a Daemon is to face damnation, to court a Daemon is to embrace it.

Concerning The Three Great Threats To The Safety Of Man On Xenos

It is mankind's manifest destiny to rule this galaxy, of that there is no doubt. Spiritual perils may beset us, the physical universe may assail us, but it is the Emperor's will that mankind and mankind alone will bestride the stars, and to that end we fervently bend our lives. There are many other creatures in this galaxy, unclean creatures born of worlds far from the sacred soil of Holy Terra, whose misbegotten forms are an insult to those who wear the shape decreed by the Lord of Man as fitting and right. Some of these creatures are weak and harmless, and easily extirpated, their planets expropriated for the true masters of the stars, their memory expunged. But there are other foiled and mankind cast down , stronger races that would see the will of the Emperor Among them are the savage greenskin Orks

 galaxy with their endless desire for war , whose numberless multitudes plague the . Hulking creatures, bigger than a man, they are mindless, yet powerful and unafraid. Elsewhere can be found the fickle Eldar, those who cannot be trusted, beings which extend the hand of friendship whilst clasping a dagger behind their back. Beware these fiends deadly as their lying tongues ; their machineries of war are as swift and as . Likewise the Tyranids, blasphemous monstrosities who reduce worlds to bare rocks in their feeding frenzy, their endless armies made up of hell- spawned bio-constructs.

Other things dwell in the dark places of space—the Hrud, whose very presence is poison even to the rightful progression of time; the Tau grotesque ends with no thought for the proper rites , whose heretical technicians enslave technology to their ; the Verminthiculians, wild mercenaries and reavers. But fear not, the alien may be legion but man is the stronger, and their warmongering is but the desperate savagery of those who know that their end draws near.

# **REBELLION**

The Imperium is the only rightful authority of mankind. It has been decreed by the Emperor, and His will, executed by the Adepts of Terra, is absolute. But man has ever been a fractious creature and not all agree that this should be the case. Therefore the rule of Terra must, by necessity, be harsh. Be this as it may, the size of the Imperium means the grip of governance is, perforce, loose, and rebellion is only regarded to have taken place when one of the tithes goes refused.

Worlds which rise up to shake off the fatherly hand of the Emperor fall into the following four main categories:

**Governmental Revolt:** Occasionally the ruling body of such a world might misguidedly decide that their world would be far better off outside of the Imperium. They might not have been visited for a thousand years or the planetary governor may harbor territorial ambitions, but whatever their motivations, the result is the same—ruthless and immediate repression. These revolts must be dealt with swiftly and graphic examples made of the ringleaders, for if just one planet is shown to succeed in such a quest, others will certainly follow. It may take centuries to quash a revolt, but no human world must be allowed to secede. Assassination, planetary assault and, occasionally, Exterminatus are all righteous tools that may be employed to bring the wayward world to heel.

**Popular Revolt:** It is a regrettable fact that many citizens of the Imperium suffer the most horrendous living conditions in less than ideal environments. From time to time, a particularly bold demagogue may rally his fellows and overthrow the government. This only becomes a problem if they then go on to defy the authority of the Imperium, otherwise the new regime will go unmolested—it is ordinarily not the adepts' way to impose governmental form upon a population. Foolishly, flush with success, the rebellious people of a world often go on to do just that, mistakenly identifying the Imperium with their oppression and not their salvation.

Also, it is sometimes better in planets with a particular strategic importance to ensure continuance of governance. In both these cases the forces of the Imperium are brought to bear.

**Xenos Infiltration**: There are many creatures in the universe that exist by using other creatures as their proxy. These may be creatures from the physical realm, such as Genestealers, or beings such as the Enslavers, who somehow have a material being but dwell within the empyrean. Sometimes these worlds carry on seemingly as normal, the rest of the galaxy unaware of the dark, alien cancer eating at their heart. As often as not though, the alien-dominated population will rise up in armed rebellion. In either case, utter destruction of the infested inhabitants is, regrettably, the best course of action. This can be effected via tectonic destabilisation, Exterminatus, cyclonic torpedoes or viral (general or geno-tailored) bombardment, dependant upon the importance of the world and possibilities of recolonisation.

**Daemonic Infiltration:** A planet may turn to worship of the Dark gods under a number of circumstances. Suppression of such revolts must be handled carefully—destruction of the population may be the Dark Powers' actual aim, as the psychic death scream of millions of people can be enough to permanently open a rift between the warp and the real universe. Planetary invasion by specialist formations is advisable, followed immediately by planetary cleansing or destruction.

# **ON ORGANISATIONAL DISAGREEMENT**

*Regrettably, even the true organs of galactic governance can become embroiled in disagreements with each other. The very creation of the Imperium as it stands today is entirely predicated by the actions of the Warmaster CENSORED—CODE 15/775/Sigma and one only has to look at the wickedness perpetuated by the High Lord Goge Vandire to see that it is inadvisable to rest too much power in the hands of any one of the Emperor's hands. It is only fitting that each Adept should maintain a healthy suspicion of his peers.*

*Divided we stand, united we fall. E Unis Pluribum.*

# WAR

*"The Emperor asks only that you hate." —* Last words of Commissar Roth.

I I n war humanity excels, and the Emperor's armies are spread across the galaxy. The threat or effects of war are never far away, no matter where you go in the Imperium. Mankind seeks to purge the stars of its enemies, and the bloody carnage it wreaks in doing so shows no sign of abating. The Imperium's military is at once mighty, glorious and terrible.

# **IMPERIAL GUARD**

The Imperial Guard is the backbone of the Imperium's military might. Millions upon millions of well-trained men and women, organised into thousands of regiments, make up the Guard. With lasgun and bayonet they march upon alien battlefields and garrison vital worlds. They form the Imperium's first line of defence and they strike the first blow in many crusades. Its regiments are drawn in great tithes of manpower from the Imperium's worlds and each regiment has a unique character and fighting tradition, from the rigid discipline of the Steel Legion to the stealthy brutality of the pale-skinned Stygian 23rd and the unflinching bravery of the Vostroyans. Vast conscript armies, elite special forces, massive tank columns and glorious sabre-wielding cavalry can all be found in the Imperial Guard, often fighting alongside one another on Emperor-forsaken worlds they have never heard of. Regiments do not remain on their home worlds but are raised explicitly to be sent to fight and die light years away from home. And die they do, for the Imperial Guard bear the weight of the Imperium's wars. It is said that the Emperor knows the name of every soldier that has fallen fighting in His wars—but if that is true, He is the only one who can comprehend just how many Imperial Guardsmen have died in the ten thousand years since the Emperor ascended to the Golden Throne. Those who survive the grinding horrors of a lifetime of war are frequently gifted a portion of the very land they fought to conquer as a reward. As with many things in the Imperium, this is a mixed blessing indeed.

The Imperial Guard regiments are raised from the local armies of the Imperium's worlds as part of a planet's tithe to the Imperium. These regiments are normally deployed according to the orders of the Adeptus Terra. However, when the High Lords declare a major military campaign (often referred to as a "crusade") they appoint a Warmaster chosen from among highranking Imperial Guard officers to command the campaign's regiments. One of the most famous Warmasters, Macharius, was given the title Lord Solar on account that he conquered a thousand worlds on the Imperium's eastern fringe and expanded the Imperium to the very edge of the Astronomican's reach.

# **IMPERIAL NAVY**

The Imperial Navy holds nearly all of the Imperium's fighting vessels; local governments, Warmasters and others are forbidden to maintain their own fleets of warships. Their spacecraft include some of the most potent engines of destruction in the whole galaxy, including mighty battleships thousands of years old. The Navy's ships range from small escorts with a crew of a few dozen to the immense Emperor-Class battleships which might have tw-

# The Commissariat

The Imperial Guard is exposed to terrible threats which can shake the resolve of even the most steel-hearted veteran, from bizarre aliens to the terrifying inhabitants of the warp. To encourage the men to fight the most horrendous of situations, commisars are attached to regiments of Imperial Guard. The role of a commissar is to fight alongside the regiment when morale is flagging or the men are not fighting with sufficient zeal 's officers and take control . In such situations a commissar can take over command from an officer and summarily execute any man who tries to flee. Even the colonel of a regiment must be sure to display courage and zeal at all times when a commissar is watching him. Commissars are orphans educated within the Ecclesiarchy and selected from among those who show fearless faith in their Emperor 's Schola Progenium . They are then assigned by the Commissariat to Imperial Guard regiments whether the regiment in question likes it or not. Commissars are pious, self-righteous and unswerving in their purpose. They are exceptionally brave and many a seemingly hopeless battle has been turned by a commissar taking command. However, they are universally feared and loathed by the men of the Imperial Guard and are always the first against the wall when a regiment mutinies.

enty thousand souls or more on board. The Navy also includes fighter and bomber crews and aircraft that support the Imperial Guard on the ground.

The Navy's officer class is highly traditional and aristocratic in character. The Imperium's noble families frequently boast naval officers among their number and naval dynasties dominate many battlefleets. Elitism is a virtue on most ships, where the officers' lives are in stark contrast to those of the ratings and engine crews. With thousands of crew living and dying on ships that can spend decades without seeing port, a ship of the Imperial Navy becomes a society in its own right; a city in space. Mutinies are not unknown and the Naval security battalions are a familiar sight on the decks of all Naval ships, their black visors and shotguns constantly reminding the men that obedience is their duty to the Emperor.

The Navy relies on many other organisations to function. Perhaps most importantly, these ancient and complex ships could not function without a complement of Tech-Priests who know how to appease the ships' machine-spirits and maintain technology that is too old and mysterious to be replicated. The Navy is also reliant on the Tech-Priests of Mars for refits, upgrades, repairs and new ships.

It is usual for a warship to have astropaths on board, for proper communication is essential if the Imperium is to be defended. Many captains are glad to have Ministorum clergy among their crew, ministering to the spiritual needs of the men and steeling their spirits with sermons. Commissars are appointed to the larger ships, watching over the moral fibre of the crew and providing a watch against mutiny and impiety. Then, of course, there is the Navigator of each vessel, whose family can occupy entire spires jutting out into space atop the ship.

# **THE ADEPTUS ASTARTES**

The Adeptus Astartes, known as the Space Marines, are the elite warriors of the Imperium. They are few in number and regarded with almost mythical awe by most folk, for they are inheritors of traditions founded by the Emperor Himself. The Space Marines are divided into Chapters, each possessing a thousand Space Marines along with its own support staff and spacefleet. It is said that there are around a thousand such Chapters in the Imperium.

A Space Marine is recruited in adolescence from among the most violent cultures of the Imperium. His body is hugely enhanced with new organs promoting muscle and bone growth to give him immense strength, size and resilience. His mind is similarly enhanced; hypno-doctrination and sleeplearning give him both a fervent belief in the Imperium and the knowledge of weapons and tactics to bring the Emperor's wrath to the battlefield. Upon completing his augmentation and training (which not all novices survive), he is issued with his wargear, including a suit of power armor. This armor is one of the most powerful symbols of Imperial might, depicted in statuary and stained-glass windows across the Imperium. Equipped with nerve-fibre bundles so it moves in sync with his body, a Space Marine's armor not only grants him great strength and protection but is a work of art, resplendent in the heraldry of his Chapter.

Each Chapter is independent from the Adeptus Terra. While most will eagerly answer the summons of a Warmaster or a plea for help from somewhere in the Imperium, some Chapters have their own agendas and cannot be relied upon entirely. All, however, serve the Emperor loyally with complete devotion.

All Chapters have proud traditions and distinct characteristics that translate into the way they fight. The ferocious Space Wolves, for instance, are more fiercely independent than most other Chapters and fight on their own terms up close with chainswords and bolt pistols. The Iron Hands, on the other hand, have close ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus and are the masters of siege warfare, arming their warriors with an array of devastating heavy weapons and tanks. Many Chapters are legends, and names such as the Blood Angels, Ultramarines, Dark Angels and Imperial Fists are spoken of with hushed awe among Imperial citizens. A Space Marine Chapter has its own fleet of fast spacecraft and can react far more quickly to a threat than the Imperial Guard or Navy, making the Adeptus Astartes one of the only forces in the Imperium that can mount a rapid response to a crisis. The Space Marines are extremely few in number compared to the size of the Imperium and few citizens will ever see one in the flesh, but without them the Imperial military and the human race would slide ever faster towards destruction.

**GREY KNIGHTS** Deathwatch

The Space Marines of the Grey Knights Chapter are amongst the most highly specialised of the Adeptus Astartes, designed to specifically defend the Imperium against the threat of Chaos. The Grey Knights are permanently attached to Ordo Malleus and their Chapter Master is rumoured to be a member of the Inner Conclave of the Inquisition. No ordinary warriors, Grey Knights are chosen from amongst the most fearsome and savage feral cultures, each one an emergent psyker who has undergone arduous tests of faith, strength, endurance and courage that would break all but the strongest.

Grey Knights fight in baroque, heavily ornamented suits of armor, carrying mighty sigil-encrusted swords and halberds. These warriors alone can stand before the might of a Greater Daemon with any hope of banishing it back to the warp from whence it came.

The millennia the Grey Knights have spent in battle against the forces of Chaos has furnished them with blasphemous knowledge, painstaking pieced together by the Inquisitors of Ordo Malleus. Each warrior carries a copy of the sacred Liber Daemonica, the holy battle rites of the Chapter, in a ceramite case on his breastplate, and it is this which most symbolises a Grey Knight's most potent weapon; an unshakable faith in the Divine Emperor of Mankind.

# **DEATHWATCH**

Mysterious figures who battle in black power armor, fighting with preternatural skill and dedication against the most terrible of alien creatures. Appearing without warning and vanishing as quickly as they arrived, leaving no trace of themselves or of the creatures they have fought. These are the Imperium's most highly trained xenos fighters, known simply as the Deathwatch.

Forming the chamber militant of Ordo Xenos, the Deathwatch uniquely draws its members from across the many different Space Marine Chapters, all of which have sworn sacred oaths to maintain specially trained xenos fighters and stand ready to deploy them at a moment's notice. These specialised warriors are drawn together as and when needed by the Ordo to combat alien menace whenever and wherever it rears its vile head.

Rumour has it that Ordo Xenos maintains a number of secret fortresses at the fringes of the Imperium where the Deathwatch keeps a silent and constant vigil, ever watchful for the tell-tale signs of alien encroachment.

# **SUPERSTITION & FAITH**

*"Thought for the day: Blind faith is a just cause." — Liber Imperialis*.

T The weapons of war may do much to guard the Imperium from the threats that assail it. Yet the strongest armor is not forged from ceramite, it is formed of faith.

# **THE CULT OF THE EMPEROR**

The Cult Imperialis is one of the few common factors that link the disparate worlds of the Imperium together. No matter what conditions prevail upon a world within the Imperium, the Imperial cult will be found there.

The ways in which the Emperor is worshipped are multitudinous. To some He is revered as a distant, patriarchal and human figure. Others identify Him with some aspect of nature, many others, such as the primitive Epheisians of Dwimlicht, regard Him as a star-god, for His agents only visit occasionally and they descend from the heavens when they do so. But all the creeds of the cult agree upon this one thing: there is only one Emperor. To worship a pantheon of gods and put other gods alongside Him is heresy. However, there have been many individuals over the millennia who have been seen as His saints, people visibly touched by the Emperor, and they are venerated all over the Imperium. There are saints for every aspect of life and there is a thriving trade in their relics on many worlds.

The worship of the Emperor is, in the main, highly organised. Cathedral complexes can be found in the capitals of all worlds of any meaningful populations. On the densely populated, teeming hive worlds, these can occupy entire spires. The graceful structure of the Emperor Triumphant, constructed after the Second Armageddon war at Hive Primus on Armageddon, climbs delicately skyward, its main tower nearly a full kilometre in height. The statue of the Emperor at the top brushes the troposphere, looking benignly down upon the seething, polluted world below. Most towns will have a church or temple to the Emperor and even the crudest village of the most primitive tribesman will sport a sacred cave or grove dedicated to his name.

Of course, in some places, the worship of the Emperor supercedes all other aspects of life—these are the shrine worlds of the Imperium, where perhaps one of the great saints, or even, in the distant past, the Emperor Himself, performed a great deed. These planets can be one, vast, religious complex, or huge cemetery worlds such as Granithor, where the wealthy spend vast fortunes bringing the dead scions of their families for burial, usually those who have perished in the service of the Emperor. Then there are the cardinal worlds, which attract millions of pilgrims and are the strongholds of the cult. These planets are directly governed by the Ecclesiarchy and are the seats of functionaries high in the Cult, responsible for the spiritual health of vast areas of space.

The Ecclesiarchy maintains and promotes the cult galaxy-wide and, where possible, tries to sanction the worship of the Emperor no matter how bizarre it may seem. Very few practices are proscribed, and even such abominations as human sacrifice to the Emperor are useful to the Imperium, for it is easy to convince a newly encountered culture that approves of such custom to give up its psykers to the Black Ships.

One of the Ecclesiarchy's tasks is to record this multiplicity of tradition with which the Emperor is honoured. In that way, two preachers from opposite sides of the galaxy will know, no matter what their title or manner of expressing their devotion might be, that neither is a heretic. The Ecclesiarchy sends out mission fleets for precisely this purpose, whose flotillas of blessed spacecraft slowly circle a particular part of the galaxy, recording new variants of the cult, correcting serious heresies and proselytising to newly discovered populations of humans.

To all, the Emperor is a living god. He may be tens of thousands of light years away, but that He exists, the inhabitants of the Imperium know, so faith is an easy thing. Some amongst the Ecclesiarchy and Inquisition may argue that men should be more ardent in their devotion to Him, but though some may be lax in their adulation and may blaspheme or heretically curse the Master of Mankind for their lot, it is nevertheless rare to meet a man who would dare to deny the Emperor's divinity.

# Preachers & Confessors

The Ecclesiarchy presides over the souls of the Imperium's citizens, dividing its countless diocese into parishes, some of which are centred upon a particular planet, others focused to tending to a particular locale or holy shrine. Each parish is ministered by a preacher, seeing to the well-being and purity of his flock souls. It is their duty to watch for deviancy and ensure that heretical belief is purged wherever found 's A truly pious preacher may rise to become a pontifex . , whose authority extends over several parishes and preachers. The responsibilities of a pontifex are diverse and can encompass the protection and ministration of routes of pilgrimage, the consideration of beatitudes and recommendation of canonisation to the holy synods Confessors are the booming voices of the Ecclesiarchy . , exalting the faithful to deeds of penitence righteousness. , fervour and Confessors are not charged with the ministrations of a diocese, but rather roam the Imperium

# **THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE**

Technology and its mysteries are the preserve of the followers of the Machine God, the Tech-Priests. For they believe that machines are imbued with a life-force of their own, a soul granted to them by the Machine God—a will and a personality. The more ancient a piece of technology, the greater reverence it will elicit from these robed followers, who will spend many hours anointing a machine with the correct unguents before pressing the sigils of activation to coax its spirit into life.

A machine that is both old and complicated is given the same status by the Tech-Priests as the Ecclesiarchy would give a major saint, for many of the systems on these machines are irreplaceable, their secrets lost to time. Among the greatest of such machines are the vast battleships of the Imperial Navy, or the super-heavy Titan war machines. But the Tech-Priests will also lavish their attention upon an antique lasgun or prognosticator and will spend much time trying to understand the intricacies of a device's workings. All machines though, no matter what their pedigree, are treated as living things by the Tech-Priests and they will treat all with reverence, for all are gifts from the long-lost past, knowledge of their function handed on through time only by the beneficence of the Machine God. Woe betide any man who fails to treat his weapon with respect or hurls abuses at his desktop logicator within the range of the machine enhanced senses of a Tech-Priest.

Paradoxically, true machine intelligences are held to be anathema by the Tech-Priests, for they view these as soulless automata, spiritless things cast into the galaxy to confound the will of the Machine God. Shrouded in myth and legend, these abominations are rumoured to have originated during the Dark Age of Technology. Supposedly pathologically dangerous, an Inquisitor may encounter them, although rarely, in the course of his duties. Should they learn of these creations, the Tech-Priests will hunt them down, investigate them and then destroy them. Only properly sanctioned logic engines, those deemed to have a spirit gifted them by the Omnissiah, are allowed to persist.

# Chapter X: The Inquisition

*"Innocence proves nothing."*

— Inscription above the gates of the Calixian Conclave spire.

Acolytes of the Inquisition work for a secretive and wide-ranging organisation, which is charged with a vital task. The Inquisition guards the soul of mankind, fending off Daemonic corruption, witchery and mutation lest humanity succumb to their blandishments and fall into darkness. The Inquisition is by necessity a clandestine and complicated organisation. Mystery and fear are essential tools in its mission and Acolytes soon learn to use them to their advantage. The common man fears the agents of the Inquisition as harbingers of woe who steal away loved ones or uncover horrific cults. Even planetary governors, Imperial nobles and military leaders blanch at the mention of an Inquisitor's presence, as well they might, for all hide some guilty secret.

*"Come in acid-storm they did, with the rain and the lightning licking the spireport as they landed. They cut the power to the big estate-habs. Whole half the hive went dark with it, and by the time they got it running again and stopped the riots and scraped up the dead, it were too late. They never found no one left up there. Just cold and empty palaces, not a lick of scrap left in the place. Five noble houses gone and they never did say why neither. I venture I could make a guess or two though—the things you see when you're cleaning viewports…"* 

— Phormbis, Hive Tranch Windowjack.

A Overview *"Mutants are bad, and what's worse is what comes in their wake. Listen up, stubberscum, if you spy something strange with your platoon mates, report it! Otherwise the Inquisition will be through here like the worst dose of gutf lush you ever swallowed, giving each and every one of you a Commissar's Welcome—the last and loudest noise you'll ever hear!"* 

— Arms-Sergeant Heikon Thrass, Mortressen 103rd.

*"'Quisitors? Hush now, we don't even speak of 'em. You names 'em, you call 'em an' that's the last thing yer want. They'll 'ave an excruciater up yer fundament afore yer can scream 'Throne blind me!'"* 

*—* Agri-hand Jaspus Sawney.

# **ORGANISATION**

*"Understanding is overrated."*

*—* Stormtrooper Sergeant Havlock.

A As with the other Adepta, the Inquistion is a confusing tangle of duty and power, secrecy and division. The highly autonomous and covert nature of most Inquisitors only serves to exacerbate the situation. There are wheels within wheels, and many hidden depths to the knowledge and power of the Inquisition. Many Acolytes are ignorant of all but the most fundamental structure of their organisation. Others still know nothing at all of the monolithic, byzantine order.

# **OVERVIEW**

Broadly speaking, the Inquisition is a feudal organism. At its base are a great number of thralls toiling to support a complex edifice of influence and duty. At its very peak rests the master of mankind, the God-Emperor, in whose name all acts are justified. In between sit all manner of offices, fiefdoms, ranks and privileges, all of which an aspiring Acolyte may one day hope to claim.

At the very lowest level, a person may work for the Inquisition unknowingly. These minions may have some inkling that they are involved with a secretive organisation but believe it to be mundane in nature, such as a crime syndicate, religious order or governmental murder squad (on some planets, of course, these are one and the same). These folk are not considered to be Acolytes of the Inquisition merely pawns, employees and agents to be moved upon the field of operations and dropped or sacrificed at will. In their way, they may play an important role but they will never know the truth of their deeds.

An Acolyte is a different creature altogether. The Acolyte is aware that he serves the Inquisition, and will have spoken to his master at least once in his career. He is thought of as a seed of potential that may one day stand to become a fully fledged Inquisitor. Though he starts at an admittedly lowly level, as disposable as any unwitting agent, he has a certain something that sets him apart. This may be an incredible skill or talent, a prophesied destiny, the luck to be in the right place at the right time, or simply something about him that appeals to the Inquisitor in some way.

As he progresses in his service, gaining skill, experience and success to his name, an Acolyte becomes more valuable to his master. Those considered to have proven themselves will be given more and more important tasks and will gain greater knowledge. These trusted Acolytes may come to have cadres of Acolytes or unwitting agents working for them, and may even be asked to seek out potential recruits for their Inquisitor to assess. With time, their master may even deem them ready to begin the long and arduous task of training to become an Inquisitor themselves.

Though far fewer in number than Acolytes or unwitting minions, Inquisitors very firmly form the heart and soul of the Inquisition. These independent and wildly varying individuals drive the organisation forward, seeking out all manner of foulness and ensuring its destruction. There are countless types of Inquisitor, with endless levels of power. Each controls an intricate and subtle web of agents, Acolytes, resources, influences and contacts. Functioning very much as a microcosm of the Inquisition itself, each of these networks is capable of operating independently if need be—though what manner of necessity would require such isolation is a troubling thought indeed.

Whilst the chain of command amongst the ranks of the Inquisitors is obscure at best, the ultimate expression of the group's tremendous powers is the Inquisitorial Representative to the High Lords of Terra. The Representative's role is to observe the workings of the Imperium and inform the High Lords of dire threats uncovered by the Inquisition. The means by which an Inquisitor is appointed as the Representative are very obscure and the Representative changes constantly, with the same Inquisitor rarely serving on the High Lords' Council twice. He is not the leader of the Inquisition, because no one man could ever claim leadership over the wilful and scattered ranks of its Inquisitors. He is at best an advisor who can whisper in the ears of the High Lords and, through them, the Emperor Himself. Beyond this basic structure, the Inquisition is further organised into loose groups, roles and affiliations. Each of these serves to further muddy the treacherous waters of the organisation. These ordos, conclaves and factions are as diverse as those who make up their ranks. Whether it was these structures that have shaped the Inquisitors into the varied force that they are, or vice versa, is a matter of great debate.

An Inquisitor has the power to declare an individual, or sometimes an organisation or wholeplanet, as "Excommunicate Traitoris". This declaration excommunicates the accused from the human race and is an indication to other Inquisitors and Adepta that the excommunicate party should be hunted down and killed for the good of the Imperium. Inquisitorial gatherings are often the venue for declaring excommunications and, in extreme circumstances, even a fellow Inquisitor can be labelled Excommunicate Traitoris. Excommunication is never done lightly but is a principal weapon of the Inquisition and one of the ways its authority can be used to protect the Imperium.

**THE ORDOS OF THE INQUISITION**

The great ordos are the principal means by which the Inquisition organises itself, and most Inquisitors belong to one of them. The ordos are groups given over to rooting out a particular threat against mankind. With millennia of specialisation, each has become a sharply honed weapon with which to excise those that would seek to move against mankind.

# **Ordo Hereticus**

The Ordo Hereticus is the largest of the ordos and its Inquisitors watch for enemies among the Imperium's own population. Members of the Ordo Hereticus are sometimes known as "Witch Hunters" because of the priority they place on apprehending psykers. Mutants, rebels and heretics are also targeted by the Ordo Hereticus. The Ordo has no qualms at all about acting against threats in the other Adepta and many a renegade Ministorum cardinal or corrupt Tech-Priest has met his end at the hands of a Witch Hunter.

The Ordo Hereticus often makes use of Imperial forces, like the Imperial Guard or Adeptus Arbites, to aid in the fulfilment of its duties. However, armed forces led by a Witch Hunter Inquisitor frequently include Sisters of Battle. Centuries ago, following the Age of Apostasy, the newly reformed Adepta Sororitas and the Ordo Hereticus forged an agreement to assist one another in fighting the Emperor's enemies. This agreement, made at the Convocation of Nephilim, is still shrouded in mystery and it is suggested among some Inquisitors that the Sisters of Battle and the Ordo Hereticus are following some secret plan that only the canonesses of the Sororitas and a few Inquisitor Lords fully understand. Whether this is true or not, a Witch Hunter can expect to find common purpose with the Sisters of Battle, and the two organisations work together extensively.

Inquisitors of the Ordo Hereticus are commonly figures of incredibly strong will. Some are fitted with special psychic hoods designed to nullify hostile witcheries targeting their mind or person. Others prefer to trust in the Emperor, uttering litanies of protection and hate as they move against rogue psykers. As with the other ordos of the Inquisition, the Witch Hunters are happy to use individuals with psychic powers, provided they have been properly sanctioned. Perhaps surprisingly, there are many Inquisitors amongst the Ordo Hereticus who are capable of using psychic disciplines themselves. Woe betide the witch who is hunted by one such individual, for these Inquisitors are notorious in their zeal. Perhaps it is because they are fully aware of the terrible dangers that lurk within the warp, or perhaps it is a result of their training—whatever the case, these psychic Witch Hunters will stop at nothing to destroy the corrupt and tainted.

Some Inquisitors within the Ordo Hereticus specialise in the identification and eradication of mutants. They may have numerous cells of Acolytes at their disposal, which range from hive-toughened flamer squads, trained to purge large infected areas, to precision assassination cells, which remove and replace key political figures that have succumbed to the lure of the Dark gods. In most cases, such Inquisitors will be less concerned with the mutants themselves (as they are a relatively simple matter to deal with) and more with the causes of mutation. An outbreak of mutation may herald a terrible event, point to an upswing in cult activity or simply be the inexplicable whim of the Ruinous Powers. Whatever the cause, the Ordo Hereticus will require an investigation and purge. This can sometimes cause the Ordo to be involved in high-profile events, such as the removal of a head of state, the cleaning up of corrupted pollutants or even outright war.

Occasionally the Ordo will find itself pitted against an individual being or phenomenon which presents a significant threat. This might be as varied as a psyker of unprecedented power, a mutant with terrifying abilities or even a governor unwilling to carry out necessary pogroms. In such cases, the Ordo Hereticus will excommunicate the offending person from the human race and then hunt them down with frightening ruthlessness. The ordos will call upon any allies they feel necessary, from the Sisters of Battle, to members of other Adepta or servants of another ordo. They are willing to do whatever is needed to get at the excommunicated party, even if it should mean sending the Imperial Guard against the Imperium's own people. Better to end a thousand innocent lives than to suffer the spread of corruption.

Perhaps more so than other arms of the Inquisition, the Ordo Hereticus is concerned with the big picture. Their duty tasks them with tending to a vast flock, and as such, individuals within that mass are seldom of importance. The Imperium is comprised of billions of souls, each of which is a potential psyker, mutant or rebel. The Ordo Hereticus fights on countless fronts, endlessly, with no warning of where fresh heresy may arise. Whilst cells of Acolytes or particular Inquisitors may have the luxury of dealing only with the local situation, the scholars and masters of the Ordos look upon events with a distanced eye, thinking in terms of systems and sectors rather than planets or countries. To some observers, this impersonal attitude is vile, but to members of the Ordo Hereticus it is necessary to protect mankind from itself.

# **The Sisters of Battle**

The Sisters of Battle are the Chamber Militant of the Ordo Hereticus and are more properly known as the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas. Their duties include performing purity sweeps through Imperial organisations, persecuting apostate clerics, guarding some of the most dangerous of the Ordo's prisoners and acting as wardens on the infamous Black Ships. These and a thousand other duties are entrusted to these most holy servants of the Emperor. The Adepta Sororitas is also closely allied with the Ecclesiarchy and perform beneficial works throughout the Imperium. This includes the Orders Hospitaller, which provides medicae to almost all arms of the Imperial military, and the Orders Famulous, which forms a network of advisors and diplomats to insure that the Imperium's noble households work towards the ultimate good of Mankind. Lastly there is the Sisters of the Orders Dialogous who are scholars and experts in the translation of texts both human and xenos, holy and blasphemous. The Sisters of Battle are a powerful fighting force in their own right, defending religious sites, guarding Ecclesiarchy adepts, watching over the safety of the huge pilgrim convoys criss-crossing the Imperium and fighting Imperial campaigns of a religious significance.

# **Ordo Malleus**

The Ordo Malleus is the smallest and closest-knit of the ordos, and its Inquisitors are among the most knowledgeable, incorruptible and dangerous men and women in the galaxy. This is because the Ordo Malleus fights perhaps the most dangerous opponent that mankind can face—the Daemon. Daemons are creatures of the warp, servants of the foul powers that dwell there, and they are things of utter evil and madness whose very presence can only lead to corruption and death. The Ordo Malleus—the Daemonhunters—have the responsibility of battling these otherworldly horrors, risking their very souls to fight what might be humanity's ultimate battle against the madness and malevolence of the warp.

The fight against the Daemon requires the Ordo Malleus to share precious information among its Inquisitors and work together. Alone amongst the ordos, the Daemonhunters have a distinct home base—the Inquisitorial facilities on the moons of Saturn. This is where the Ordo's great libraries of Daemonic lore are kept, its volumes carefully warded against the malevolent nature of the information they contain. The Ordo Malleus fleet is docked among Saturn's rings along with its principal fortress, where new Inquisitors are trained and old ones impart the knowledge painfully acquired over centuries of facing the direst and most corruptive of threats.

Ordo Malleus Daemonhunters tend to be very martially minded. They trust only themselves to execute a Daemon's destruction and so go to battle armed with sacred weapons and armored with potent psychic wards. It is not unknown for Malleus Inquisitors to command whole armies from the front, charging into combat against Daemonic foes and inspiring the men around them to do battle with the most horrible of enemies. For this reason many Daemonhunters consider it their duty to be strong in both mind and body, great warriors with the finest battlegear as well as the strongest will. Some Ordo Malleus Inquisitors are investigators rather than fighters, hunting down Daemonic lore and searching for the signs of a Daemon's presence, but when it comes to destroying this most heinous of foes, the Daemonhunters, with their sacred power hammers and blessed armor, come to the fore.

The Ordo Malleus needs the most elite and dedicated Chamber Militant to combat Daemons, and it has them:

the Space Marines of the Grey Knights Chapter. The Grey Knights are trained specifically to fight Daemons and they are perhaps the only force in the Imperium who can do so without eventually losing their souls. Every Grey Knight has some psychic ability, which is trained and honed until they can shield their minds against Daemonic corruption. Their power armor is imbued with potent anti-Daemonic wards and their distinctive Nemesis force weapons are designed to focus their psychic strength into formidable destructive power. The Grey Knights are based at their fortress-monastery on Saturn's moon of Titan but the majority of them are elsewhere in the galaxy at any given time, forming the retinues of Ordo Malleus Inquisitors or fighting in the cutting edge of an army led by a Daemonhunter. The Grey Knights, like most chapters, have their own fleet and support staff but, unlike most, they do not act completely independently—they are commanded by the Ordo Malleus, who alone know how to use such a potent weapon as the Grey Knights to maximum effect. In all the history of the chapter, a Grey Knight has never become corrupted by the forces of the warp and the tombvaults of Titan are the resting places of some of the greatest heroes the Imperium has ever known.

In spite of their skill and dedication, the Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus are still ultimately mortal. One of the biggest dangers they face is the possibility of one of their own becoming corrupted and ending up in thrall to the very powers they once sought to destroy. Contact with Daemons provides a constant threat of corruption, especially given that the Ordo Malleus collects knowledge about Daemons to help find and destroy them. Such is the potency of the Daemon that even knowledge of them can be dangerous. The Ordo Malleus polices its ranks thoroughly for any sign that its members may be susceptible to corruption or even already in league (knowingly or not) with the Dark gods. Nevertheless, the Ordo Malleus must often hunt down one of its own before all their knowledge of Daemonic lore is used to bring forth the horrors of the warp instead of to destroy them.

One Radical concept is the idea that the warp is a source of immense power that, if it could be harnessed, could usher forth a golden age for the human race. Some Radicals therefore search for ways in which Daemons can be controlled, binding them with complex forbidden rituals or entering into bargains with them in the belief that an Inquisitor's willpower and knowledge will allow him to cheat the damnation that is sure to follow. Some Inquisitors research the warp-spawned sorcery that disciples of the Dark gods have in turn learned from Daemons, hoping to use the warp's own magic against the Emperor's foes. Still other Radicals seek to employ Daemonic weapons or other items of power, believing that it is the will of the user, and not the Daemons bound into the items themselves, that determine whether they are used for good or ill. For every Radical purged from the ranks of the Ordo Malleus, another dares to read a forbidden tome instead of burning it, or takes up a mighty Daemon weapon instead of destroying it. It is a cruel irony that while knowledge is essential for the Ordo Malleus to fight the Daemon, that same knowledge can become the Dark gods' most dangerous weapon of all.

2"Daemons cannot normally exist outside the warp. They must be brought through either by cultists enacting ancient rituals to the Dark gods or by possessing unguarded psykers. Daemons are cunning and deceitful and many humans serve them willingly at first, foolishly believing their lies of power. However, once a Daemon is called into realspace it can do untold damage. A Daemon is not just a destructive force, although I have known of some that can lay waste to whole cities and even worlds. Their real danger lies in their corruptive powers. Even the strong-minded can be driven mad by a Daemon's powers, becoming no more than a slave to the Daemon's whims. Cultists may act in helping it call forth more of its kind from the warp, or even attempt to build an empire from among the Imperium's unguarded worlds. The result is always damnation—the worst excesses of the Ordo Malleus are as nothing compared to the eternal woe that awaits all the servants of the Dark gods. The servants of the Daemon, as well as the Daemon itself, are justifiable targets for our wrath."

# **Ordo Xenos**

The Inquisitors of the Ordo Xenos accept responsibility for protecting humanity from the predations of aliens. To most of the Imperium, the alien is an abomination, a heathen who desires humanity's destruction and who must be slain for the good of mankind. Most Inquisitors share this view and pursue the alien to the point of extinction if they can.

Some aliens are a threat to the Imperium in a military sense, invading large swathes of Imperial space, ransacking planets and killing or enslaving the inhabitants. The green-skinned rampaging Orks and voracious Tyranids are chief among these large-scale threats. The Imperial Guard and Imperial Navy are the main weapons against these xenos hordes, and the Imperium's war zones are constantly ablaze with battles against them. The Ordo Xenos is instrumental in leading the Imperium's military forces against major xenos invasions, gathering intelligence and deploying troops. An Inquisitor in this position makes decisions that can cost millions of lives and must be prepared to go further than even the most hard-hearted Imperial Guard general or Navy admiral in stemming the alien tide. Some of the Ordo Xenos' greatest Inquisitors, such as the legendary Inquisitor Kryptmann, have sacrificed entire worlds to deny them to alien forces.

Other aliens are far more subtle. These in a way are more dangerous, because the Imperium's armed forces cannot be brought to bear against such a foe. Some aliens can control humans or otherwise hide their tracks, living among human communities and corrupting them. Alienled cults can persist for centuries, sometimes attaining great power and prestige for their members, taking advantage of the superstitious and repressive nature of many Imperial worlds to enslave hundreds of thousands of people. Inquisitors of the Ordo Xenos search for tell-tale signs of alien infiltration, often gathering groups of nearby Inquisitors to them before they move to destroy it wherever it is found. Such Inquisitors are hard-nosed investigators who must be prepared to face inhuman enemies and show no mercy to those in thrall to the alien.

A few alien threats are dormant, waiting to emerge. Many examples of fallen alien civilisations are dotted around the galaxy on dead and quarantined worlds, and not all the aliens there are completely extinct. It only takes an ill-advised mining colony or Explorator mission to awaken something ancient and slumbering. To prevent this, many Ordo Xenos Inquisitors actively investigate the relics of alien civilisations, hunting for potential dangers among cyclopean alien cities and forgotten tomb-worlds. These Inquisitors frequently work alone and, needless to say, one of the dangers they face is awakening the very alien horrors they seek to keep dormant.

While many Ordo Xenos Inquisitors believe that all aliens must be killed, this is not true for all of them. Some believe that if an alien species does not wish the Imperium harm and does not move against Imperial interests then cooperating with them is not out of the question. Some aliens possess technology that far surpasses the Imperium's own, such as the elegant digital weapons made by the ape-like Jokaero, and trading for such technology may be to the Imperium's benefit. Furthermore, the Imperium shares common enemies with some species, and alliances between Imperial and alien forces are sometimes a necessity. Some Ordo Xenos Inquisitors actively foster these alliances, believing that their superior knowledge of alien methods and mindsets negates the risks of collaborating with xenos. These beliefs are considered Radical among the Ordo Xenos and their adherents can be shunned or even hunted down by their brother Inquisitors. Nevertheless, the contact an Ordo Xenos Inquisitor has with alien species can impart a belief that some of them can be used, not just destroyed, by the Imperium.

# **Con claves**

As well as having the capacity to command the Imperium's military forces, the Ordo Xenos also have access to the Ordo's Chamber Militant—the Deathwatch Space Marines. The Deathwatch is an unusual Space Marine Chapter that draws its members from the other Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes, with Marines serving in the Deathwatch for a set period of time before returning to their original Chapters. Most Space Marine Chapters are a part of this ancient agreement, sending Space Marines with the most appropriate skills to be trained and equipped for a term of service as specialised alien hunters under the command of the Ordo Xenos. A squad of Deathwatch Space Marines is invaluable when an Inquisitor comes to exterminate an alien infestation, investigate a potentially deadly alien world or eliminate a particularly loathsome xenos creature. Some Deathwatch squads are placed at the disposal of a conclave, but most of them are appointed to the retinue of a particular Inquisitor until his mission is complete.

**Other Ordos**

Whilst the three great ordos are perhaps the best known and established, there are a number of other smaller ordos charged with guardianship of particular aspects of the Imperium. Some police the ranks of assassin death cults, whilst others tend the workings of the Black Ships. Rumours persist of Inquisition ordos which watch the officers of the Imperial Guard and Navy, and others whose sole task is to purge the ranks of the Inquisition itself. Whilst in theory these smaller ordos are of equal rank and power to Ordo Hereticus, Ordo Xeno and Ordo Malleus, in practice they seldom control as many resources as these great organisations.

# **CONCLAVES**

Aside from their membership of an Ordo, many Inquisitors also serve in a regional grouping generally known as a conclave. These federations of Inquisitors watch over a particular area of Imperial space, although the whole Imperium is by no means covered by conclaves and endless tracts of it are devoid of a permanent Inquisitorial presence.

Conclaves can include Inquisitors from all manner of ordos as well as those who belong to no other organisations. The largest conclaves, those which watch over particularly populous or dangerous areas of the Imperium, have enormous resources available for the use of their dozens of Inquisitors, from spaceships to private armies. The smallest might number only three or four Inquisitors and a handful of trusted agents.

# **The Calixian Conclave**

As with many others throughout the Imperium, the Calixian Conclave has a long and labyrinthine history. This ancient establishment has gathered many resources over the years, ranging from small safe houses on distant planets to mighty fortresses like the Tricorn officio on Scintilla. Troops, secret libraries, ancient pacts and even entire merchant companies are in the control of the conclave—though many would be hard pressed to find any evidence of such a thing. There are also numerous hidden heresies and forbidden episodes buried within the annals of the conclave.

The symbol of the Calixian Conclave is a golden chalice. At Inquisitorial gatherings, an ornate version of this chalice is often displayed upon a table, plinth or other prominent position. Tradition holds that it should be filled only half-way with clear liquid. The mythology of the conclave holds that this is either a draught from the well of knowledge or the waters of forgetfulness. The original charter in which this detail was recorded has been lost and copies of the tattered manuscripts seem to contradict one another. Darker whispers from the more Radical elements of the conclave whisper that the symbolic cup is in fact the Chalice of Corruption, a warning to those who would taste the mysteries locked within the Calixis Sector's apocalyptic fate.

# The Black Ships

A major duty of the Inquisition, alongside the primarily investigative role of the various ordos, is running the Black Ships. These craft, crewed and commanded in conjunction with the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, transport psykers from all over the Imperium to Terra. These psykers are given up by Imperial worlds as part of their tithe, and indeed surrendering psykers to the Inquisition is one of the most important rules of Imperial law. The skill of the Inquisition at finding the truth about a planet'<sup>s</sup> psyker population and the power of intimidation that the Inquisitorial Seal brings with it means that the Black Ships could not function effectively without the Inquisition's help.

Some of the psykers transported to Terra are strong enough to be trained as Imperial psykers or astropaths. The rest are never seen again and as far as most people see it, what happens to them is a secret known only to a few Lord Inquisitors and senior Adepts of the Telepathica. The crews of the Black Ships come from both the Telepathica and the Inquisition. Adepts of the Telepathica test the psykers being transported, selecting those who are strong enough to shield themselves from possession by warp entities to begin their training. The Inquisition's role is to scrutinise the tithe gathered from each world to make sure that there is no shortfall in the number of psykers given up, monitor the psykers being transported in case they pose a threat while in transit and (though not their official duty) pick the best psykers for training and use by the Inquisition itself. Indeed, many Acolytes with psychic powers began their careers as unwilling passengers on a Black Ship, where 

their talents were first recognised. The Black Ships themselves are dark places of despair, for they are little more than spacefaring high-security prisons and many of the psykers being transported know full well that they will meet a grim fate at their journey's end.

# **Cabals**

Any conclave has the power to commission a special cabal to investigate a particular matter, though they are rare. Sometimes the line between cabal and conclave are none too clear, particularly in areas where there are few Inquisitors. Cabals are, in practice, autonomous bodies, specialist taskforces charged with the prosecution of a particular sensitive concern. Cabals are despised by many, who see them as secret societies or unnnecesary inner factions within a conclave. However, they have been shown to be a highly effective tool: by combining and focusing the activities of varied Inquisitors on a particular scheme, cabals have often achieved noteworthy successes.

The Tyrantine Cabal of Inquisitors within the Calixis Sector is an example of a large and comparatively close-knit cabal. The ominous threat of the much prophesied Tyrant Star—a strange apparition that heralds great disaster—has forced Inquisitors to band together. Appearing as it does, seemingly at random throughout the sector, the Tyrantines have so far been unable to track or predict its wax and wane. Whenever events begin to herald the arrival of the Tyrant Star—mass riots, dreams of a black wreathed sun, natural disasters, unprecedented psychic phenomena and so on—nearby Inquisitors and Acolytes race to observe the appearance. The data they record is shared amongst the other members of the cabal and is much debated upon.

# **FACTIONS**

A further division within the Inquisition is the personal philosophy adopted by each Inquisitor and, to some extent, their Acolytes. The members of the Inquisition are men and women of strong character and convictions, and each has a different view of how the Imperium should best be saved from the many threats that beset it (including the Inquistion itself ). There are as many beliefs as there are stars in the sky but over the centuries Inquisitors have found common cause and banded together into factions. Some factions are ancient and can claim many powerful Inquisitors among their ranks, while others are little more than cells of two or three like-minded Inquisitors.

Many Inquisitors describe a broad split in their ranks between Puritans and Radicals. Puritans more or less believe the Imperial Truth as it is handed down to the Imperium's citizens—the Emperor is a god, the dark forces of the warp are unutterably evil, and mutants, heretics and witches must not be tolerated. Furthermore they tend to believe in maintaining the status quo of the Imperium, since it is the instrument of the Emperor's will. Puritans are mostly young and full of fire, eager to prove themselves to their peers and their Emperor by hunting down mankind's traditional foes and preserving the stability of the Imperium. Many Acolytes also share this zeal, particularly as they are often at the sharp end of any engagement with cultists, mutants and other such scum. Even if he does not entirely agree with this view of the Imperium, an Inquisitor will often encourage Puritan ideals within his servants, knowing that they will expedite the task of rooting out corruption with great gusto.

Radicals, meanwhile, have deviated from the Imperial Truth. They vary immensely in their beliefs, from those who use the forces of the warp against its inhabitants to Inquisitors who seek to shatter the very Imperium they serve. A Radical will often say that all Inquisitors start out as Puritans, but that as they are exposed to the realities of the Imperium and the galaxy beyond, they inevitably become more and more flexible in their ideas and all become Radicals in the end. Puritans, on the other hand, consider the more extreme Radicals to have been corrupted by the very power they wield and the dreadful knowledge to which they are exposed. Most Radicals try to conceal their divergent beliefs when in the company of many other Inquisitors, preferring to pursue their agendas away from the sight of more puritanical souls. Some, however, are outspoken in their views and can gain many enemies in attempting to convert Puritans to their cause. Inquisitors are generally wary of such beliefs within their Acolytes, at least until they have proven themselves over many successful investigations.

It is not unknown for Inquisitors to come into direct conflict over their beliefs. On a few occasions Inquisitors have been dragged into hidden, internecine wars, using the Inquisition's valuable resources (and often their Acolytes) to purge the ranks of their enemies and settle old disputes. Such conflicts are rigorously concealed from the rest of the Imperium, and even the highest-ranking adepts would be de-eply shocked to discover that these inscrutable, allpowerful guardians of humanity can be riven with dissent and even murder. Even when these conflicts are not exposed, they simmer beneath the surface—there is probably not a single Inquisitor in the Imperium who does not have an ideological opponent among the Inquisition's ranks. Given that Inquisitors are men and women of action, such conicts always come to a head sooner or later.

For these reasons, Inquisitors are often unwilling to openly identify themselves with one faction or another. Acolytes are frequently in the dark as to their master's true predilections. Some Inquisitors hold that such things are not for the likes of Acolytes, whilst others refuse to discuss such complicated matters until the Acolyte is astute enough to have guessed where their master's beliefs lie. Rumours and half-truths constantly circulate between cells of Acolytes, which only further serves to muddy the water. Acolytes who succeed in divining their master's faction may discover that he holds beliefs that are very different to their own, which can lead to some very interesting moral quandaries.

# **Puritans**

Perhaps the largest Puritan faction in the Calixis Sector are the Amalathians, named after the Conclave of Amalath at which many Inquisitors swore to uphold the stability of the Imperium. Amalathians believe that the Imperium is the Emperor's own work and that it must be preserved in its current state—maintaining the status quo is the goal of the Amalathians. The most extreme Puritan faction is the Monodominants. These hard-line Inquisitors believe that the Imperium can only survive if everything else is destroyed. Monodominants are intolerant in the extreme, advocating the wholesale slaughter of heretics and rebels and xenocidal campaigns against alien races. There are a great many crimes in the mind of a Monodominant, and death is the only sentence.

# **Radicals**

There are too many Radical factions to count, but some have a great many adherents. One of the most prevalent is the Xanthite faction, named after Inquisitor Xanthus who was hunted down and killed by fellow Inquisitors for his beliefs. He believed that the warp, and even the Daemons that lived within it, could be harnessed for the good of humanity. Xanthites study the warp and the ways of Chaos, employ forbidden sorcery, Daemon-wrought artefacts and even bind Daemons into their service. Knowledge is the weapon of choice for a Xanthite, and turning their enemy's weapons against him is their favoured tactic. Meanwhile, the Isstvanian faction, named after Horus' great betrayal of the Imperium at Isstvan III, believes that the Imperium becomes stronger through war and catastrophe. Isstvanians attempt to ferment rebellion and disaster at every opportunity, with mayhem and strife as their primary goal. Many an Inquisitor has investigated a dire threat to the Imperium, only to discover that it is the work of an Isstvanian.

# Methods Methods

*"The end justifies the means."*

*—* High Justicar Prateus.

The methods employed by an Inquisitor can often provide a clue as to their personal philosophies. Each Inquisitor works in a different way, as befits such highly individual beings. Some like to work alone, whilst others employ thousands. Some lean towards direct, personal action, whilst others like to puzzle things out from a sequestered retreat filled with comm-links and data-lines. Whatever the case, the modus operandi of each Inquisitor is unique.

# **AN INQUISITOR'S CADRE**

Broadly speaking, each Inquisitor controls a network of agents beholden to serve his needs and interests. In turn, each Inquisitor also has certain obligations to his Ordo, conclave or conscience, which he must fulfil. An Acolyte quickly learns that he is but a small part of a wide and subtle web of influence, knowledge and power. Frequently he will merit little direct attention from his master—at least until he proves himself capable and worthy.

An Inquisitor may inherit a cadre of people, resources and obligations—particularly if they are taking over from a mentor or deceased colleague. More usually, however, they will create a network over a number of years. Acolytes often find themselves part of a cadre that has an intricate history and must be carefully dealt with. They may find themselves caught up in petty rivalry or suffer jealous outbursts from other cells of Acolytes. They may have to deal with various eccentricities and habits that seem bizarre at first. For example, they may find that their master will only speak to them over vox-link from another room or that they are forbidden to wear the colour blue in the Inquisitor's presence.

# **New Recruits**

Freshly recruited Acolytes are usually bound together into small groups and tasked with simple investigations. Sometimes a promising Acolyte will be told to remain a "sleeper agent" living a normal life until such time as the Inquisitor has found a suitable number of companions to form a cell. Some Inquisitors like to craft finely balanced groups, filled with Acolytes whose skills and personalities perfectly complement one another. Others prefer to throw individuals together and hope that they get on.

These newly forged cells will sometimes be required to swear binding oaths of companionship but, more often than not, the Inquisitor will leave the group alone to figure out their own loyalties, hierarchy and so on. Most Inquisitors do not have the time to nursemaid young Acolytes and view the behaviour of the group at this time to be particularly revealing of their future potential.

New cells will feel pressure to produce results. Successful investigations, thorough purgings, insightful observations and other such victories, all serve to cement their reputation. Cells that fail to perform seldom remain active for long. Occasionally the members will be split up and reassigned, but usually they simply disappear. Dark rumours of mind scrubbings, servitor assignment and other terrible fates constantly circulate between groups of Acolytes, becoming more sinister with each retelling.

Depending on the nature of their master, new Acolytes may have contact with other cells. These may be other inexperienced peers or elder groups. Through these contacts, new Acolytes will generally find out very quickly that there is a great deal they do not know about their master. They certainly will not know the full extent of their Inquisitor's cadre. Other cells within the cadre are just as likely to purposely mislead them about this as they are to help and guide them.

# **Ranks and Player Characters**

In game terms, an Acolyte's progression through the stages of trust and responsibility is represented by their Rank within

their Career Path. As a Player Character gains Ranks, so too does their importance to their master rise.

**1st–3rd Ranks:** New Recruit. Promising, but do they have what it takes?

**4th–6th Ranks:** Proven Acolyte. Demonstrated ability, but are they a survivor?

**7th–8th Ranks:** Trusted Acolyte. Tough and competent—Inquisition material?

**Completed Career Path:** Ready to become an Interrogator?

The manner in which they have gained these Ranks is important. Should they be smart, successful and devoted to the Emperor, they will receive many rewards and exciting tasks to fulfil. If they have merely bumbled through investigations, yet still managed to not die, their master will consider them an Acolyte who is lucky, rather than competent. Of course, in some situations a lucky fool is exactly what is required…

# **Proven Acolytes**

Once a cell has a number of successful missions to its name, it rises in estimation and status within the Inquisitor's cadre. The Acolytes have proven themselves capable and independent enough to take on more difficult assignments. They will gain marginally more time with their master and be given slightly more insight into the nature of the Inquisition. At the same time that they begin to understand what they are involved with, the danger of their duties begins to increase. Inquisitors frequently regard this stage as a crucible, through which only the most driven and capable may pass. Losses at this stage are often high, both of life and limb.

# **Trusted Acolytes**

Naturally enough, the dangers and travails of the Acolyte's lot mean that as time goes on, the ranks thin. The weak, foolish, indiscreet and unlucky do not survive assignment to dangerous tasks. Those that remain are considered capable indeed. Some may even gain the trust of their master. Acolytes that gain their Inquisitor's confidence become powerful and highly useful servants. Often completely accustomed to their master's ways after years of service, trusted Acolytes are allowed to organise and control entire sections of the Inquisitor's cadre. This may be as simple as keeping track of certain cells or as complicated as setting up planet-wide investigations. Trusted Acolytes are often the seneschals and chatelains of the Inquisitor's holdings, running households, businesses, elaborate false identities and the like whilst he is away. Some trusted Acolytes are primed for longterm undercover assignments, becoming vital sleeper agents, nestled in positions of power. Indeed, some shrewd Acolytes hold that Inquisitorial influence is the best way to gain coveted political positions on some worlds. Trusted Acolytes gain a level of independence and knowledge unimaginable to Acolytes lower down the pecking order, to the point where some new recruits are unable to distinguish them from true Inquisitors.

# **Inquisitors in Training**

At some point or another in their career, most Inquisitors will sponsor a promising Acolyte to become a full member of the Inquisition. As usual for the quixotic organisation, there is no single standard way that the Inquisition does this. In some places, Acolytes are sent to formal training schools, where they learn the arts of the Explicator and Interrogator. In other places, the Acolyte is "adopted" by the Inquisitor and learns at their side as an apprentice. On occasion the Acolyte is subjected to strange and painful rituals or abandoned upon some hellish world to walk their own path and prove their worth. The Acolyte may or may not be aware that they are being groomed for power. There have been instances where an aged master has vanished, only to leave their cadre, status and library of secrets to a very surprised Acolyte. Whilst an Inquisitor in training is generally thought to be of a higher status than the ordinary Acolyte, they are still beholden to their master and owe him fealty. Only once they have completed all the necessary rites to become a full Inquisitor will they be considered to have left the Inquisitor's cadre. Even then, their former master will still be able to exert considerable influence upon the new Inquisitor.

Though the structure of the Inquisition is such that a chain of command does not really exist, in practice there are many ways in which other Inquisitors can have influence upon an Inquisitor and their cadre.

At the lowest level, an Inquisitor may spend time assisting lower-ranking Inquisitors with their investigations. There are many reasons why this may be done. The lesser Inquisitor may be an old apprentice or may have information that is much needed. An alliance where the Inquisitor can be sure of a controlling hand may be temporarily necessary or, of course, they may choose to do such a thing out of kindness. Lending assistance will place a strain upon the Inquisitor's resources and Acolytes may well feel the pinch as a result of this. Lower-level, unimportant cells may be temporarily seconded over to the lesser Inquisitor—perhaps even permanently gifted should the need be there. Some Inquisitors see this practice as a perfect way to be rid of troublesome or awkward cells.

An Inquisitor's peers may also have a great effect upon his cadre. It may be that two or more Inquisitors decide to pool their resources to deal with a particular problem. In which case, Acolytes may find themselves working alongside another cell. In other cases, Acolytes may find themselves caught up in rivalries or outright hostility. Should their master be a member of an unpopular faction, Acolytes might find themselves the victims of threats and violence designed to disturb or persuade their Inquisitor away from dangerous beliefs. Zealous rivals might even seek to destroy the cadre completely—and the lives of the Acolytes along with it.

More subtle manipulations might also be passed down from older Inquisitors. It may be that they have specific instructions from an ordo or conclave, which the Acolytes may end up enacting for their master. Elders may act as a mentor for the Inquisitor, guiding them towards particular actions or discouraging them from others. Sometimes Acolytes may find themselves in the uncomfortable position of mistrusting their master's mentor, knowing that a particular deed is suspect, even whilst being forced to carry it out. Even more disturbingly, Acolytes might even be asked to report upon their own master, in cases where corruption is suspected. In these cases, they are frequently trapped between disloyalty to their Inquisitor and seeming to share guilt with a suspected renegade.

#### Exterminatus

278 Exterminatus is the term used for the destruction of an entire planet by order of the Inquisition. As such, it is an incredibly rare and vastly powerful event. The Inquisition has, in theory at least, sole access to the weapons with the potency to destroy a whole world and they vary from high-yield virus weapons to cyclonic torpedoes that can penetrate a planet's crust and tear it apart in a chain reaction. It is a measure of an Inquisitor's strength of will that he is willing to cause the deaths of billions of people through the Exterminatus, but in the case of alien or Daemonic infestation, it takes an Inquisitor to understand that it is for the good of those same people that sometimes the ultimate sanction must be taken.

# **Other Inquisitors** **AN ACOLYTE'S DUTIES**

As part of an Inquisitor's cadre, Acolytes may be called upon to perform various tasks on behalf of their master. They may receive formal orders from their master, written requests, missions dictated by intermediaries or may even be managed by older, more trusted Acolytes.

# **Investigation**

Perhaps the most common mission an Acolyte will be tasked with is the gathering of information. Knowledge is power and the actions of Acolytes allow their master to cast his net wide indeed. Investigations might be full-on covert operations, making use of all manner of high-tech and low cunning. They might also be simple catch-and-question missions. In some cases, psychic disciplines will be necessary. Sometimes Acolytes will need to gather evidence or follow a confusing tangle of leads. In some cases, particularly when uncovering a cult, Acolytes will need to be skilled at following people and extracting information. Wits, skill and speed are all vital parts of succeeding at these sorts of missions.

# **Purge**

Sometimes Acolytes will be charged with the destruction of something, or someone, deemed to be abhorrent. This might be as simple as a surgical strike upon a criminal organisation or as complicated as the destruction of a powerful cult magus. Most cells of Acolytes have standing instructions to destroy any mutants, cultists and the like who they uncover in the course of their investigations. By way of contrast, some cells specialise in assassination of particular targets, such as political leaders, freethinking agitators or all too charismatic preachers.

Occasionally a particularly dangerous object must be located and destroyed, in which case Acolytes will need both the skills to find and destroy the item, as well as fend off whatever terrible effects it has, and the attentions of other groups who wish to claim it for themselves.

Whilst Acolytes are expected to be capable of defending themselves—indeed, some cells specialise in it—serious assaults where high body counts are necessary are seldom likely to be the sole purview of a cell of Acolytes. Inquisitors will usually call upon the Chambers Militant of their Ordo or conclave to bring additional firepower to the fray. Acolytes can sometimes find themselves working alongside Sisters of Battle, or even the Deathwatch. Of course, these forces are only involved if serious resistance is anticipated. If Acolytes walk into a room full of highly armed cultists by accident, escaping with their lives is their own concern.

# **Special Circumstances**

Sometimes Acolytes will find themselves sent to perform tasks that they do not understand or that are somewhat unusual. Perhaps they will be asked to take a tour of duty aboard one of the Black Ships or to help round up rogue psykers. Sometimes they might be asked to guard an item or individual, or courier shipments between worlds. Perhaps they will be asked to trial new combat stimms, live amongst xenos or masquerade as a hive gang for a number of months. Sometimes they will need to do darker deeds, such as find a suitable Daemonhost or investigate a rival Inquisitor for corruption. These sorts of tasks are often the ones that produce the most hesitation and moral quandary within Acolytes, for it is not always clear if their action is a good or bad one.

# **Tradition**

*"Only the wisest and stupidest men ever change." —* Lady Olivia Ol'Wynn of Hive Sibellus.

O One of the few constants of the Inquisition is that there are no standard regulations, codes of practice or "correct" behaviour. Whilst the other Adepta follow dogma set down millennia ago, the Inquisition remains a flexible and unpredictable organisation. An Inquisitor is free to arrange his affairs in any manner that suits his needs and personality. However, humans being the creatures they are, the Inquisition does possess a certain level of tradition and custom within its various ordos and conclaves. The Calixian Conclave, for example, looks to the ancient wisdom of the Scintillan Dictates to guide it, inscribing and interpreting its principles until they have an almost liturgical quality to them.

# **SYMBOLS**

Perhaps the most common shared traditions are those steeped in powerful symbolism. In many ways, man is a very simple creature, who responds very well to certain images. The Inquisition knows this, and is happy to exploit it to suit its own needs.

Fire is traditionally associated with the Inquisition and its works. The image of the cleansing flame is a strong one and Acolytes are encouraged to employ it when they have need to strike fear. Wherever there is the whitehot excruciator, a witch pyre or a promethium-dripping flamer, there too is the Inquisition. Other than the literal interpretation of fire as a weapon, there are other uses for such symbolism. Many Inquisitors consider their role to be that of the cleansing flame, there to burn away the rotting esh of corruption. Some also hold that they are guardians of the Emperor's light, the holy flame of faith. Those that attend the Black Ships speak of fuelling the mystical beacon of the Astronomican, casting willing souls into the furnace of the Emperor's will.

The hammer is also associated with the Inquisition. Many Inquisitors carry gorgeously bedecked warhammers with which to smite their foes. Like the Ecclesiarchy, many members of the Inquisition regard the hammer as a metaphor for piety, the force by which heresy and corruption are crushed. Warhammers are common gifts for Acolytes who have proven themselves especially adept at destroying cultists and heretics.

Aside from the flame and the hammer, perhaps the most powerful of the Inquisition's symbols is the Seal. Each Inquisitor bears an Inquisitorial Seal. This is a small amulet or icon in the shape of a stylised column. Thought to depict a pillar of strength or rod of control, this seal is their badge of office and for an Inquisitor to reveal it shows that he is demanding that his authority be respected. An Inquisitor who shows his seal to a planetary governor, for instance, expects to have the planet's resources at his disposal from that moment onwards. The Inquisitorial Seal is, in a sense, an Inquisitor's most important item of equipment, and he will never willingly relinquish it. Some seals incorporate circuits and sonic probes that can be used to hack into cogitators and open electronic locks, or double as simple weapons to ensure that the Inquisitor is never unarmed.

An Inquisitor and his cadre can also display the Inquisitorial Rosette, a symbol of the Inquisition worn on an Inquisitor's clothing or wargear. The rosette can be worn by those in an Inquisitor's employ and can also be displayed on vehicles or by the armed forces being used by the Inquisitor. The rosette signifies that an individual is in the employ of the Inquisition and is enough to ensure the fearful cooperation of most adepts and citizens who know of the Inquisition's purpose. The rosette, however, is used very sparingly, as most Inquisitors prefer to keep themselves and their Acolytes low-key. The rosette is most commonly used when in the company of fellow members of the Inquisition or when an Inquisitor wishes to strike fear and awe into the common man.

# **CUSTOMS OF THE CALIXIAN CONCLAVE**

The Calixian Conclave has many traditions and rites unique to its organisation. These have grown up over the many hundreds of years that the conclave has watched over the sector and serve to bind the Acolytes and Inquisitors together through common custom. Whilst some pay little more than lip service to these habits, others treat them as seriously as the Imperial Creed.

When they are new to the Inquisition, Acolytes are unlikely to be party to the mysteries and traditions of the conclave. They are likely to find the unwritten rules of the group inexplicable at first. Their first encounter with such things might be to attend a consecration of a temple as an honour guard or to stand outside the door of an Inquisitorial gathering, knocking three times and being refused access. Others might be sent to collect an annual tithe of thanks, only to discover it is naught but a slap in the face and a sack of grain.

As they become accustomed to the ways of the conclave, Acolytes may be invited to take part in the cycle of gatherings and rituals. They may also get to know the unspoken laws of etiquette and behaviour common to the conclave. Their master, for example, may instruct them in the Scintillan Dictates, or else an elder cell of Acolytes may decide to take them under their wing. Acolytes may choose to reject the trapping

of the conclave, indeed, if their Inquisitor is of Radical tendencies, they may be encouraged to ride roughshod over the "proper way" of doing things. They are, of course, free to do so but such behaviour will mark them out as "strange", "difficult" and "unreliable".

There are countless rituals and practices used by the Calixian Conclave. Some are highly obscure, attended only by a few or only taught to those with the proper level of initiation. Others are widely known by Acolytes and Inquisitors alike. Some of the most common customs are presented below.

# **Petitioning**

An Inquisitor expects much of his Acolytes, however, as with any feudal master, he holds some obligation to his servants. Acolytes have a right to request things from their master. This may be as simple as a shot of amasec and a ten minute briefing or as grandiose as an entire moon. The Inquisitor may not always grant these petitions, but cleverly made, apt or amusing requests may be heard. Experienced Acolytes know only to ask for things that cannot be had in any other way and to ask for them in an unusual fashion. Those that ask for too much too often are considered to be somewhat foolish and are generally ignored. Many Acolytes spend some time sizing up their master's foibles before making a petition.

# **Customs in Game Terms**

The customs of the Calixian Conclave can add to games of Dark Heresy in many ways. For example, if a Game Master wishes to run a game involving intrigue between Inquisitors, a great feast or ritual gathering can make a perfect backdrop. Similarly, scenarios where Acolytes must sneak into a shrine of Saint Aret to recover a hidden file are full of possibility. Severely wounded characters that spend a Fate Point to avoid death might see a vision of Saint Uthur guiding them or even believe that the Saint has performed a miracle. Some Player Characters might spend a long time working out the details of a spectacularly intricate petition, whilst others might merely carry an icon of Saint Castor to smooth away their troubles.

Players and Game Masters should feel free to invent their own saints, customs and rituals, for the Calixian Conclave is a huge and convoluted organisation. No book could ever hope to chart all of the traditions of such a complicated and superstitious group.

**The Scintillan Dictates**

Some centuries past, legendary Inquisitor Heraclion Theos issued a series of letters that have now become common teaching for Acolytes of the Calixian Conclave. Originally intended for investigators stationed on the capital planet of Scintilla, later generations of scholars have read many deeper levels of meaning and interpretation into what, on the face of it, seem very simple instructions.

#### Thy master's will shalt be the whole of the law.

This is loosely translated to mean that Acolytes should not be held back by local custom and law. In the service of the Inquisition, even the darkest of illegal acts are sometimes justified.

#### Thou shalt know thy duties.

Broadly speaking, Acolytes should know their remit and dutifully follow their instructions. This dictat is also interpreted to mean that Acolytes should not stand by and allow heresy and other transgressions to go unpunished even if their Inquisitor seems unaware of them.

# Thou shalt not over-esteem thine own importance.

This dictat causes some confusion amongst scholars. It is generally agreed to be an admonishment to remember that each Acolyte is but a small part of a larger picture, which only the Inquisitor has access to. Some believe it to be a reminder that sacrifice, even of one's own life, is a necessary part of the Inquisition's work.

# Thou shalt not make improper use of thy master's purse, nor his seal, nor his name either.

Perhaps the clearest of the dictates, this is almost universally held to be a warning against abusing the incredible resources an Inquisitor can call upon. Most also believe that it is a commandment to be subtle in one's work, invoking the Inquisition only when absolutely necessary. Some Acolytes take this dictat to extremes, living in penury and never speaking the name of their master, lest they draw his wrath.

#### Thou shalt seek no reward but the satisfaction of thy master.

Commonly believed to be a warning against profiteering from investigations, this dictat has perhaps the widest leeway attached to it. Some Inquisitors closely watch their Acolytes and their possessions to ensure that they are not becoming too luxuriant. Others seldom bother looking into their servants' dealings. Most ensure that Acolytes do not display their status too openly, knowing that the temptation to show off, impress attractive strangers, claim recognition, free drinks or notoriety can all too easily lead to disaster or corruption.

#### Thou shalt be glad of thy master's punishment, for it is deserved and it improves thee.

282 282 Opinions vary wildly about this dictat, depending mostly, it seems, upon the nature of the person doing the interpretation. Some flagellants hold that "deserved punishment" is an Acolyte's lot, as a poor and stumbling vessel of the Emperor's will. Meanwhile, some point to the concept of constant improvement implied in the dictat as proof that Acolytehood is but a crucible, intended to burn away impurity and forge a strong and powerful Inquisitor from what was once humble clay. Some, admittedly more cynical in nature, hold that the true essence of this dictat is a commandment to rejoice, for even whilst being punished, the lot of an Acolyte is far, far better than that of the average citizen.

# **The Emperor's Grace**

Acolytes and their masters see and do many things that the mortal mind was not meant to witness. Faith is all too easily tested by the horrors of Daemons, mutation and corruption. The Calixian Conclave offers its servants indulgence, grace and confession via Inquisitor-Priests skilled in the arts of absolution. Acolytes may be offered forgiveness for the deaths of innocents and for heresies gone unpunished whilst undercover. Preparatory funerary rites can also offer the Emperor's grace to those about to embark on tasks where death is likely. These Inquisitor-Priests also form a vital part of the Exterminatus ritual, in which they cleanse the soul of the murder of a world.

The Calixian Conclave also has a small and secret number of Imperial saints ordained and worshipped in a furtive manner by blind, mute priests of the Ecclesiarchy. Acolytes often call upon these saints to intercede on their behalf, bringing prayer and confession before the eyes of the Emperor Himself. They also swear oaths by the saints, particularly when in a tight spot.

# **Saint Uthur the Cataplast**

Known as "Uthur the Unfortunate" or "The Cursed", Saint Uthur is said to accept misfortune and suffering upon the behalf of others. Acolytes insist that he was once one of their number, where that official canon states that he was an Inquisitor-Priest. Uthur is usually invoked to guard against injuries. Tradition states that if one screams to the Saint loud enough before looking at a wound, he may be convinced to take some of the injury upon himself. Devotees burn bandages in his honour or smear statues of him in medicae balm. Saint Uthur is usually depicted as a weeping middle-aged man clutching an imbalanced scale and a lightning rod. Images of Uthur traditionally have ninety-nine wounds, each caused by a different calamity. It is a point of pride amongst statue carvers to ensure that no two icons of Saint Uthur are the same.

# **Saint Castor the Obviate**

The remover of obstacles and patron of truth. Legend has it that this missionary endured all manner of undignified public punishments upon the feudal world of Maccabeus Quintus, including five attempts to cut off his head. Each one failed until he pointed out an error with the guillotine's mechanism. According to the legend of his beatification, the people of Maccabeus Quintus were so impressed by his pious devotion that they rose up in support of the Imperial Creed, casting down their government to much rejoicing. Acolytes call upon Saint Castor to watch over interrogations, smile upon investigations and speed answers to the minds of researchers.

# **Saint Aret the Lethecant**

Saint Aret is a martyr. The nature of his death, and indeed his true name, has been lost over the ages. At the time it was generally agreed that his miraculous death was truly one of the most spectacular cases of martyrdom ever seen. However, it seems in the centuries between the petition for his beatification and the eventual granting of the sainthood, his legend was forgotten. When the scribes of the Calixian

Conclave searched their archives, they found that the only book of his deeds was damaged, his name half-erased and his achievements mouldered away. After much debate, it was decided that Saint Aret should guard over that which should not be remembered. His shrines are dust-filled archive rooms where forbidden scrolls are abandoned and data is sent to decay and die. Statues of Aret usually have large ears, so that Acolytes may whisper their fears, deeds and memories to the

# **Death**

Acolytes and Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave are offered a great honour upon death that many Imperial

Saint, who will bear them away, to trouble them no more.

citizens could never dream of attaining. When death in service arises, the name of the departed is passed along to the script-savants of the conclave. This ancient brood of lexiconographers record the names of the dead in vast tomes, bound in creaking leathers and smeared with preservative oils. The skulls of especially honoured servants are ground within mortuary pestles and the bone dust used to set the ink upon the vellum pages. Once full—a regrettably frequent event—the tome is sealed with gold and lead. These golden ledgers are then sent to Terra, where the books are interred in vast subterranean data-crypts, there to rest for all eternity near the Emperor Himself. This practice is known as "descripting", and many Acolytes say that a dead comrade has been "written up" or "gilded".

Now, Shoulder Your Burden for the Glory of the Emperor Contained herein has been the merest overview of the Imperium of Man. The glory of our Emperor casts its light upon a million worlds and so the information I present here is, sadly, of a limited nature. There is much more to learn about the galaxy and a great deal of that will test the body, mind and soul. Perils unnumbered lie around every corner and the sights and sounds of a million cultures will attempt to confound you, but be strong and you will prevail. In reading this you have begun to prepare yourself for the journey you must take. The enemies of the Imperium are everywhere and the long war needs new soldiers. Soldiers like you. For whatever reason, you have been selected by an Imperial operative to serve him in his travails as he seeks to bring order to the chaos of the galaxy. Serve him well and you will forever know the light of the Emperor and dwell in His favour. Survive, and one day you may find yourself recruiting others as you yourself have been recruited, passing on the torch of duty and obligation to others so that more men may come to dwell in peace under the watchful eye of our undying lord. That it is a burden not shouldered lightly is plain, but we carry the weight of the galaxy lightly upon our backs, for should we stumble, the Emperor will be at our side to steady our steps. Now, gird yourself, take up your weapons and prepare your mind. The Emperor and mankind needs you. **O. S. C.**

# **Chapter XI: The Calixis Sector**

*"It is an ill omened place, my lord. Cursed, they say, a fount of witches and other foulness. A chalice of corruption, haunted by a dead sun. They say it is but a matter of time before the stars align and the entire place is torn asunder by Daemons. Of course, they say that about a great many places. But in this case, master, the Tarot indicates it is actually true."*

*—* Diviner Adept Harpious Mundis.

The Calixis Sector is located in the Segmentum Obscurus, on the northern edge of the known galaxy, and represents a portion of the considerable territories conquered by the Imperial hero Lord Militant Angevin more than a thousand years ago. Its first governor was Drusus, one of Angevin's most capable generals, a man now revered as an Imperial saint.

This territory represents a vulnerable fraction of the Imperium, far from the millions-strong armies and mighty battlefleets that protect its most ancient and important worlds and defend its war-torn frontiers. The fate of the sector is tainted with disturbing prophecies and haunted by an inexplicable evil. Within its ill-portended bounds there are countless threats to keep the adepts of the Imperium stretched beyond capacity. It is up to a few extraordinary individuals to save the sector from being consumed by a dark future of corruption and suffering.

# **OVERVIEW**

The Calixis Sector has many heavily populated and important worlds, but it lies a great distance from the Imperium's heartland and, like so much of the Imperium, it must ultimately fend for itself. Like all Imperial territories, the Calixis Sector is at risk from the chronic dangers facing humanity: war, mutation, xenos activity, the mark of Chaos, and so on. However, a singular threat lurks somewhere in the Calixis Sector, a mysterious,

Sector Governor Marius Hax

Lord Hax *(*whose formally correct title is *"*Lord Sector*"* or *"*Lord Calixis*")* is descended from an ancient family of Terran stock*,* a bloodline bred for leadership in the Imperial heartland of the Segmentum Solar*.* He was appointed governor of the sector by the High Lords of the Adeptus Terra more than one hundred and fifty years ago*,* and maintains a firm*,* unflinching grip on the planets under his control*.* The Lord Sector is a man of immense gravitas and solemnity*,* a glowering*,* intimidating presence at the heart of the Lucid Palace on Scintilla*.* Hax makes few public appearances*,* and personal audiences are rare*.* His devotion to the minutiae of leadership is legendary*—*it is said that he sleeps just four hours a night*,* and personally reviews the daily fiscal and economic reports in great detail*.* His reputation in the sector at large is therefore chilly and austere*:* he is popularly mocked as an unsmiling hardliner and administrative stickler*,* and also feared as a figure of unsympathetic authority*.* This widely accepted image*,* however*,* misses the essential truth*.* He is a painfully fair*,* even*-*handed man*,* devoted to the principles of ordered rule*.* In person*,* he is tall and granite*-*featured*,* and dresses in starkly simple dark robes*,* eschewing all aristocratic finery*.* He is over two hundred Scintillan years old*,* though modest juvenat treatments make him appear to 

be a robust fifty year old*.* Hax is not a man to be trifled with*,* nor underestimated*.*The Lord Sector is driven by his convictions*,* not in the right or even divine authority of the Imperium*,* but in the absolute necessity of order and obedience for the survival of the human race*.* Hax cares little for events on individual planets and is even dismissive of happenings on Scintilla *(*of which he is nominally planetary governor*).* He cannot be distracted by the fates of a few million citizens here and there and is more concerned with the big picture*,* levying correct tithes and collecting them*,* monitoring psykers and rebellious groups *(*Hax despises rebels above all others*,* including cultists and witches*)* and maintaining the conspicuous

majesty of the Imperium*.* Hax is surrounded by a lavish court populated by representatives and advisors from organisations and worlds across the sector*.* He values good advisors and is willing to listen to them*,* as long as they do not overstep the mark and openly contradict his philosophies*.* Hax has the power to request military assistance from the Segmentum Governor on distant Cypra Mundi*,* but he is loathe to do so*.* The Calixis Sector is his*,* and his presence and the activities of his adepts should be enough to awe its citizens into obedience*.*

# **Using the Calixis Sector**

This chapter presents an overview of the Calixis Sector's worlds and power groups. There are many reasons why this information has been included in Dark Heresy. For instance, it provides enough information for a GM to run a campaign without having to come up with a sector and its worlds by themselves. The GM can then concentrate on the adventures his players engage in without worrying about the backdrop and setting. In addition, the information presented here provides a sample taste of the worlds, people and organisations of the Imperium for GMs who are not particularly familiar with the 41st Millennium. Even players and GMs who have a thorough knowledge of the *Warhammer 40,000* universe will find information in this chapter that they will not have come across before. Perhaps most importantly, this chapter presents some of the themes on which Dark Heresy is based, such as corruption, moral ambiguity, power and secrecy. In addition to the information presented here, there is an extensive "living encyclopaedia" detailing all of the planets and sub-sectors of the Calixis Sector. All of this and more can be found at **www.blackindustries.com/calixis/**

In the campaign setting given here, players take on the roles of Acolytes serving one of the Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave. The worlds described provide plenty of opportunities for Inquisition-based adventures, from investigating the nobility of Scintilla, to hunting debased mutant cults in the blackest pits of Sepheris Secundus. The locations vary from towering hives, home to billions of citizens, to the hardy frontier settlements of Iocanthos. The inhabitants of these worlds are more varied still: astonishingly wealthy aristocrats, dedicated adepts, underhive gang scum, mad cultists, heartless warlords, impassioned preachers, downtrodden mutants, pious citizens living in ignorance and countless others. Any of them could provide GMs with enemies or allies for their Acolytes and some of the most important individuals are fully described in this chapter.

Nothing in the Calixis Sector is set in stone. GMs can set their games in the sector as it is written, change it to suit the campaign they had in mind, or even pick their favourite parts and transport them to somewhere else in the galaxy.

prophesied doom that has drawn the particular scrutiny of the Inquisition to this group of worlds. This enigmatic threat, the Hereticus Tenebrae, or the Tyrant Star as it is known, is something the forces of the Inquisition most fervently wish to uncover, to comprehend and to destroy, before it is too late.

To trailing, the Calixis Sector is bordered by the hazardous territories of the Fydae Great Cloud and to spinward by the Scarus Sector. Bordering to coreward, its immediate neighbour is the Ixaniad Sector. To rimward lie the contested and unregulated frontiers of the Halo Stars.

The hive world of Scintilla, situated in the Golgenna Reach, is the capital of the Calixis Sector. Along with the hellish mining world Sepheris Secundus and the war-torn planet Iocanthos, it forms a triumvirate of worlds essential for the sector's survival. The most powerful man in the Calixis Sector is officially Sector Governor Marius Hax, who rules in the name of the Adeptus Terra from the Lucid Palace on Scintilla. However, the Calixian Conclave, led by Lord Inquisitor Caidin, is the ultimate authority in the sector, a clandestine and all-powerful presence behind the visible emblems and figureheads of power. No one has the power to gainsay the word of the Inquisition. Other important Imperial servants are Lord Inquisitor Zerbe of the Tyrantine Cabal, Cardinal Ignato of the Adeptus Ministorum, Lord Marshal Goreman of the Adeptus Arbites, Senior Astropath Xiao and Canoness Goneril of the Adepta Sororitas. The power of the Adepta, however, is rivalled by the Great Houses, the noble families and corporations, which maintain a presence across the sector. Even the minor noble houses, those whose influence is limited to a single world, hold a great deal of power over ordinary citizens.

# **THE HERETICUS TENEBRAE**

The Calixis Sector is beset by many threats but few of them are as obvious as rampaging aliens or widespread rebellion. Perhaps the most troubling is the prophecy of the Tyrant Star, the horrific harbinger of ruin and desolation, the spectral sun which consumes light, hope and sanity. This prophecy is known as the Hereticus Tenebrae ("the black doctrine" or "the shadow heresy") by the Inquisitors of the Calixis Sector. Reports of the conflict, destruction and psychic cataclysm that accompany apparitions of the black sun are often suppressed, in case disorder and fear overtake entire worlds.

The baleful Tyrant Star casts an ill light upon the Calixis Sector and nowhere seems immune from its influence. Cults and seditionist groups fester in its underhives and moral corruption gnaws away at the nobility, which holds much of the power on the sector's scattered worlds. Conflicts brew between the Adepta and the great noble families who trace their lineage to the times before Angevin's conquests. Mysteries abound, for the Calixis Sector was quite evidently occupied by more than one long-vanished civilisation in the past. The previous inhabitants of this province of the galaxy have left their indelible traces behind them. Certainly, many Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave fervently hope that the spectral sun is a legacy of aliens long since gone to dust, for the alternatives have implications that are unspeakable.

**Government Type:** Adeptus Terra.

**Planetary Governor:** Sector Governor Marius Hax.

**Adept Presence:** Adeptus Terra, Administratum (Goldenhand Consular Taskforce), Adeptus Ministorum, Adeptus Astra Telepathica (Astropathic Choir at Hive Sibellus), Adeptus Arbites, Ordos of the Calixian Conclave High Council Officio (palace headquarters at Hive Sibellus).

**Trade:** Scintilla is a major exporter of manufactured goods including ship-drive components and weaponry. It is also an important source of manpower, with a large planetary defence force (PDF) and a huge underhive population, both of which make for excellent Imperial Guard recruit sources. Scintilla cannot support itself and requires massive imports of food from the Calixis Sector's agri-worlds.

# **OVERVIEW**

Scintilla is the capital world of the Calixis Sector, a thriving Imperial hub that supports the largest planetary population in the territory. It is dominated (some observers say "shared') by two vast hive cities, Hive Sibellus and Hive Tarsus, into which the vast majority of the planet's groaning population is crammed. Despite the dominance of the two great hives, the "offspring" communities of Ambulon and Gunmetal City contribute significantly to the planet's economic function. Scintilla is a world of splendours where the wealthy and powerful compete with ruthless appetite. Astonishing magnificence abounds, from the wondrous fashions of the hive nobility to the towering spectacle of the hives themselves. Landmarks, like the Lucid Palace and the Cathedral of Illumination, are famous throughout the sector.

Scintilla is also a world of corruption. Moral decay eats away at the noble houses, whose members are often deluded by their own wealth and status. In the rarefied culture of the high-born, the corruption of power and privilege runs deep. Noble houses consider themselves (sometimes correctly) as above or outside of Imperial law and can wield immense influence. Their attitude towards those who are lower-born is callous: it is not unknown for thrill-seeking degenerates from noble houses to prey upon lesser humans as sport. At the other end of the social spectrum, the underhives are rife with mutants, outlaws and ultra-violent gangs, as well as the psychotic zealots of the Redemption. The middle hivers trapped between the aristo spires and the rancid underhives live out thankless lives of unending toil, where ignorance is a virtue and death a reward for a lifetime of loyal, drone servitude, fulfilling the exorbitant tithes levied on Scintilla by the Administratum. It has been this way since the days of Angevin, and Scintilla's various corruptions are so deeply ingrained that they have become invisible even to those who perpetrate them.

Scintilla's most important features are its two hives: immense, multi-levelled cities that house billions of citizens. Both hives on Scintilla are largely independent, ruled by councils drawn from the nobles of the spire. The majority of the inhabitants are middle hivers, the labouring classes, without whom the planet's manufactories and trade houses would cease to function. Almost all middle hivers are owned or indentured to nobles from the great sector-wide families or from Scintilla's own lesser houses. The poorest and most neglected areas are the underhives: polluted, crime-ridden places where life is cheap and brutal gangs struggle for supremacy before violent death inevitably claims them. As long as the violence does not spill into the middle hives, the authorities are happy to let the gangs murder each other in the cesspits of the underhive.

Scintilla's two great hives have always compared with one another for prestige and influence, but no rational observer could fail to acknowledge Hive Sibellus's dominance. Geographically the larger of the two hives, it is often referred to as "the Capital" or the "ruling hive", and is both the seat of political and administrative power, and the centre of the planet's manufacturing might. Hive Tarsus functions as a dark, shadowy twin, popularly referred to, by Sibellians, as the "other place". Hive Tarsus is a mercantile hive and controls all off-world trade and commerce. Neither hive could function without the other, a fact celebrated in Scintillan proverbs and myths. However, neither great hive would openly admit to the importance of the "offspring" communities, Ambulon and Gunmetal City, both of which wield considerable inuence of their own.

# **Civil Order**

Law on Scintilla is the province of the Magistratum, the planet's police force. In the hive spires, the dark green greatcoats of Magistratum officers are a common sight as they patrol the streets and investigate anything from petty theft upwards. In the middle spires, they are concerned mainly with serious or violent crime, unable and unwilling to deal with other common crimes. In the underhives, they are almost completely absent. The quality of the Magistratum's officers and procedures varies enormously through the layers of Scintilla's hives, depending on the funding and support they are given by the ruling noble councils, and on the environments they have to work in. Inevitably, it is far easier for a noble victim to get the Magistratum to investigate a crime, and far easier for a middle hiver criminal to be arrested for one. The Adeptus Arbites have a strong presence on Scintilla but they leave everyday policing to the Magistratum, concentrating on sedition, interference with the tithes, certain cult and psyker activity, and in using their paramilitary strength to help put down major riots. Most citizens never see an Arbites officer unless it is from the wrong side of a riot shield. The Arbites and the Magistratum despise each other and have little interest in working together except under dire circumstances.

The laws across Scintilla vary from place to place, but two constants are trial by combat and duelling. Both are legal on Scintilla, and trials by combat are especially common when the hive nobility are involved. Trials by combat, where the accuser and defendant fight to decide who is right, have conditions attached depending on the nature of the crime (murder and severe violent crime is to the death, while some crimes have restrictions on the weapons to be used and sometimes bizarre

conditions for victory, from first blood to the removal of limbs). It is permitted for either party to have a champion fight in their place and a skilled combatant can find lucrative, if perilous, employment in the Bloodsquares run by the Magistratum. Needless to say, good champions do not come cheap, and the very best are retained by the noble houses of the spires. Similarly, duelling is permitted on Scintilla and forms a part of the culture in the hives and elsewhere. The Magistratum does not interfere with duels and killing an opponent in a duel is not considered murder. This means it is entirely possible to eliminate an enemy by manufacturing a matter of honour between him and an opponent who happens to excel at the form of combat used in the duel.

# **HIVE SIBELLUS**

Hive Sibellus is the oldest city on Scintilla, almost certainly predating Angevin's invasions. Its immense, eight thousand kilometre-wide bulk dominates the coastal plains and lowlands of the northern temperate landmass. Where its enormous, multi-layered skirts touch the coast itself—in a five hundred kilometre belt—they spill out over the black granite cliffs like shelves or glacial ridges. Sibellus has twice the population of its "twin" Hive Tarsus.

Like almost all Imperial hives, Hive Sibellus is composed of an extraordinary conglomeration of architectural forms. Countless generations have added their own embellishments and every available surface is crammed with gargoyles, frescoes, columns and mosaics. The hive spire is a jumble of glittering wonders, while the middle hive—and even the underhive—is composed of long-fallen statues and temples to wealth and power. The middle hivers live in rickety tenements built inside the shells of great mansions and basilicas, and trudge to work each day through avenues formed by fallen statues. The underhivers live in buried hovels built into the eyes of great stone heads or clustered around the broken columns of fallen temples.

The sprawl of the hive is at its most spectacular along the rugged coastline. The hive looms—indeed, spills—over towering black granite cliffs, which are lashed by ferocious seas during the stormy season. The Lucid Palace, a city in its own right, stands on a massive column of rock rising from the sea just off the coast, connected to the hive by a single, cyclopean, stone processional bridge, as well as by countless smaller rope bridges and a fleet of ferries which transport strong-stomached passengers across the debris-strewn waters. Hundreds of rickety elevators scale the cliffs and the rock column on which the palace stands, and the hovels of ferrymen and fishermen cling to the rock face like barnacles. The bulk of Hive Sibellus itself rises up many times the height of the cliffs, casting a permanent shadow over the headland and the waters.

# **Hive Society**

Hive Sibellus is Scintilla's power centre and every noble house on the planet seeks to have its own estate on the hive spire. These estates form an extraordinary riot of architectural styles, from stern fortresses to gilded pleasure palaces. The spire is constantly growing, the new estates built on the remains of the old, and so a noble house must constantly strive to embellish its own estates to keep up.

Antiquity is everything in Hive Sibellus. A family draws prestige from the number of ancestral generations it can trace and even the newest estates look like age-weathered bastions of tradition. Hive Sibellus's nobles are intensely competitive and demonstrate their superiority through the magnificence of their estates as well as the antiquities they collect, from artefacts excavated from the deserts and jungles of Scintilla to works of art from across the Imperium. Most estates conceal a high-security gallery or museum, which sometimes holds extremely valuable and illegal items, like xenos artefacts or even dangerous proscribed texts.

The streets of the hive spire are constantly busy. Hive Sibellus' noble fashions are spectacular, impractical and perpetually changing, and the nobles travel the streets of the spire accompanied by large retinues of servants whose primary role is to look impressive. The streets in the spire are very safe thanks to the large private armies that guard every estate and the efforts of the Magistratum to man checkpoints, which regulate the people coming in and out of the hive spire. Violence in the spire, apart from trials by combat and sanctioned duels, is rare—the crime that most nobles fret about is burglary, since their collections or artworks and relics are so important to them. Tales of impossibly skilled cat burglars are a staple of Hive Sibellus' folklore and many of those tales are true, since there are a great many things worth stealing in the spire of Hive Sibellus.

Hive Sibellus's middle hive is dominated by manufactories devoted to heavy production and the enormous blocks of cheap, warren-like housing for the factoria workers. The traditions of the hive spire filter down to the middle hive, with many hivers collecting curious objects to beautify their meagre homes, aping the extraordinary fashions of the spire nobles or even keeping crudely stuffed dead relatives. The middle hive's factories and tenement blocks are built among layers of compressed mansions and statuary, making it a confusing and dark place of collapsed finery.

Somewhere deep amongst the fragments of vast statues and toppled remains of great temple-mansions, the middle hive becomes the underhive. Composed of countless compressed layers of the city above, Hive Sibellus' vast underhive is impossible to navigate and prone to frequent collapse. Underhive settlements huddle in the few stable areas, separated from one another by endless deadly warrens where hive-quakes and cave-ins are a constant threat. Many settlements are completely isolated, their inhabitants hunting underhive vermin to survive and having no idea that there is a hive city above them at all. It is not unknown for nobles of the spire to sponsor heavily-armed expeditions into the underhive to dig up coveted artefacts from Scintilla's past or to explore the tombs of a family's distant ancestors.

# **Notable locations**

Hive Sibellus' most extraordinary single landmark is the Lucid Palace, which houses the magnificent court of Sector Governor Marius Hax. The Lucid Palace, and the vast column rising from the waves on which it sits, is thought to be much older than Hive Sibellus or indeed, anything on Scintilla. The palace resembles a vast flower of stone, its granite petals overlapping to form its huge dome and the many archways used as entrances. The palace is draped with hundreds of banners representing the institutions of Scintilla and its noble houses, and having a banner fluttering from the palace dome is an honour that some will murder for.

Another spectacular landmark is the Bastion Porphyr. This slender tower of purple-black stone is the tallest point in Hive Sibellus and the headquarters for Scintilla's astropaths. Scintilla's Astropathic Choir consists of about half a dozen astropaths, the largest concentration of these powerful psykers in the Calixis Sector, led by Senior Astropath Xiao. These astropaths are the only means for contacting other sectors and without them the Calixis Sector would be cut off from the rest of the Imperium. Anyone who wishes to use them to send a message must personally climb the apparently endless spiral staircase up the tower and make their request personally to Senior Astropath Xiao. Each astropath has a different method of visualising and sending messages, and they spend their lives amid the draughty belfries of the Bastion performing intensive mental exercises and studying the tomes of symbolic code. Aside from a few servitors to assist them, no one lives in the Bastion other than the astropaths.

The other most notable landmark in the hive is the Tricorn, the palace of the Inquisition. A dark and austere trio of linked towers at the northern end of the hive sprawl, the palace is the headquarters of the High Council of the Calixian Conclave, which is to say that it is the administrative seat of the Inquisition in the sector. Since earliest times, the Inquisition has often convened and empowered a conclave of its members for each sector of the Imperium. Each sector conclave is ruled by a Lord Inquisitor of unimpeachable merit, selected and appointed by the High Lords of the Inquisition on Terra. For the past two hundred years, the Lord Inquisitor of the Calixian Conclave has been Aegult Caidin. Though respectful of the Lord Sector, Caidin answers to no one except the distant High Lords. From the Tricorn Palace, he supervises and directs the general policies and activities of the Inquisitors under his command, as well as individual specialist cabals of Inquisitors sent upon "special circumstance" missions.

The Lord Inquisitor is seldom seen in public. It is said that he keeps his true likeness secret, even from close aides and allies, so as to be free to operate unmolested and unrecognised. His true age is not known.

Lord Inquisitor Caidin chairs the High Council of the Calixian Conclave, a ruling body of seventy senior Inquistors drawn from all three Ordos, which orchestrates and monitors the Inquisition's work throughout the sector territories. Estimates suggest that over eight thousand Inquisitorial personnel toil in the officio of the Tricorn, from lowly scribes to archivists, from savants to specialist Tech-Adepts. A small but potent army of Inquisitorial troops is garrisoned at the Tricorn and dedicated starships of the Inquisition are permanently stationed at high anchor above Scintilla for rapid response deployment. It is also suggested, but unconfirmed, that the Tricorn possesses its own astrotelepathic choir. In times of great crisis, the Officio of the High Council Calixis can call upon the help of any Imperial Adeptus it requires.

The general multitudes shun the Tricorn, regarding it as a place of fear, peril and downright evil, though largely this is because the average citizen has no real grasp of the work and duties of the conclave. Nevertheless, to be seized by the Inquisition and carried to the Tricorn for questioning is a grim fate that few ever return from.

# **Inquisitional Holdings** **HIVE TARSUS**

Hive Tarsus is Scintilla's second largest population centre and is the seat of the planet's trade and commerce. It maintains an aggressive independence from Hive Sibellus, though it relies on the export produce of Sibellus's manufactories.

Hive Tarsus is in the centre of Scintilla's least hospitable desert, baking in the relentless sun and battered by sandstorms. The hive's construction is based around a foundation of immense vertical bars, between which stretch the great conglomerations of buildings that make up the body of the hive. As a result, Hive Tarsus is more vertical than horizontal, with more middle hivers climbing to work than walking.

# **Tarsian Society**

Hive Tarsus's unusual structure and hostile location mean that darkness and cold are valued commodities and, as such, very unusually for a hive city, the richest areas are those on the bottom of the hive instead of at the top. Hive Tarsus's nobility enjoy the shade afforded by having a whole city strung in a dizzying web above them, while they are far enough from the merciless sun to live in cool comfort. The very wealthiest live in pitch-black subterranean mansions where inhabitants and visitors carry dim lanterns to see by, while the air is cooled to sub-zero temperatures that require everyone to wear lavish furs. The nobility here demonstrate their superiority by controlling their environment at immense cost, even to the extent of making their handsome estates as dangerous to the ill-prepared as the worst summer droughts. Hive scum that stray too close to the base of the city are often found frozen to death, caught out by the dramatic drops in temperature the closer they get to the wealthiest districts.

The closer to the surface of Hive Tarsus, the poorer and more dangerous the hive becomes. Middle hivers labour in sweltering workshops bathed in the heat filtering down from the sun, plagued by sunbeams that sweep through the hive during the day and burn exposed skin. The outermost layers (known as the Hiveskin) are hellish; it is

Senior Astropath Xiao

Xiao is an improbably tall and broad shouldered man with a shaven head and large grey streaked beard. His blindness he wears an embroidered band around his head to cover his empty eye sockets is the only note of physical weakness about him, for even in his robes he is obviously a large and muscular man. Xiao does not permit anyone to send a message through his astropaths unless he deems it necessary. Lord Hax is rarely refused by Xiao, but anyone else must justify the use of the astropaths' rare talents. Though Xiao is unfailingly polite he is still a very intimidating man and calmly refuses to compromise once he has made his decision. Xiao is one of the most powerful psykers in the Calixis Sector but he never sends astropathic messages personally, even for Hax, always having one of his astropaths do so instead, although it is rumoured that he has an arrangement with someone very powerful for whom he sends messages exclusively.

almost too hot to breathe and hivers are bathed in sunlight so potent it can make those caught in it blacken and shrivel up in a few minutes. Layers of hovels cling to the top and sides of the hive, too flimsy to completely block out the deadly sun or the frequent lethal sandstorms. Worst of all, the heat is relentless, easily hot enough to kill those not adapted to it. The hiveskinners scrabble like scarabs across the outermost layers to avoid the worst of the sun as it moves overhead during the day. They are a sunburned, sand-scarred lot who survive by hunting the hardy fauna that dwells here including dangerous Scaldbats and mildly poisonous Fingerburner Beetles. Many wear improvised, iridescent armor suits to reflect the sun, so that they themselves resemble human-sized beetles.

# **Trade Within Hive Tarsus**

Hive Tarsus manufactures very little. Instead, its middle hive is dominated by the Goldenhand, a vast complex of trading halls and auction houses held like a great golden nugget in the heart of Tarsus's city-web. The Goldenhand houses a massive, infinitely complex financial market where commodities are bought and sold at a dizzying rate, and enormous amounts of money and goods change hands hourly. Traders representing both planetary and sector-wide houses buy, sell and try to swindle each other. The Goldenhand never shuts and is constantly thronged with people yelling out offers and curses in a complicated trader's code called Goldentongue. Most traders are accompanied by armed bodyguards, since the application of violence or even assassination are recognised tactics for gaining the upper hand. Activity in the Goldenhand is extremely intense, with few who work there lasting very long before they are burned out. Many is the man who has lost a fortune for his noble patrons in the Goldenhand and chosen to walk to certain death into the desert to do penance for his failures.

Activity in the Goldenhand is regulated by two bodies. The first is the Goldenhand's own staff of auction masters and functionaries; dressed in browns and brass, their faces painted deep gold, they look appropriately enough like a part of the Goldenhand itself. The second group is the Administratum. The adepts of the Administratum's Goldenhand Consular Taskforce (under the leadership of the energetic and surprisingly goodhumoured Consul Sevavin) forms the largest concentration of adepts on Scintilla and probably in the whole Calixis Sector. They are a familiar sight in their stark grey uniforms, contrasting with the outlandish fashions of the various noble traders, and are never jostled or threatened as they go about their business. The adepts are considered above the violence that flourishes between the other traders, partly because they represent the interests of the Holy Emperor, but mainly because they have the very best protection in the form of veteran soldiers from the death world of Mortressa. The adepts' purpose in the Goldenhand is to ensure that the tithes handed over to the Administratum from the hives of Scintilla do not consist of inferior goods with inflated values, and to maintain awareness of all the major deals going on among the planet's noble houses. Another important player is House Krin, one of the great sector-wide noble houses, which revels in its reputation as "Drusus's bankers" and can arrange banking and massive loans to anyone confident that they can pay up when the time comes. The adepts of the Administratum are based in a building of gold and glass suspended over the Goldenhand's largest trading hall, while House Krin's household troops protect the family's complex of vaults and safe rooms just beneath the Goldenhand.

Hive Tarsus's trade dominance is due to the fact that the planet's orbital docks are geostationary above the hive. It is said that Tarsus is the "lungs and stomach" of Scintilla. Vast wharfs and warehousing/handling vaults dominate the middle hive, pulsing with the import and export of goods. There are said to be chambers the size of cathedrals in the dense heart of Hive Tarsus, packed with crated goods never claimed or shifted.

# **Protectorate Barracks**

Hive Tarsus's proximity to the orbital docks means that it is also the home of the planet's military units. Scintilla's planetary defence force, the Army of the Scintillan Protectorate, is based at Hive Tarsus. It draws its troops from across the planet and there is considerable rivalry between regiments. The regiments raised from Gunmetal City's ruffians consider themselves to be superior and they are mostly justified in this, with the Gunmetal regiments being the equal of the Imperial Guard. The Gunmetallicus 41st, in particular, is a prestigious elite formation whose troops are used to escort VIPs and perform dangerous missions in the wastelands between the hives. When the Imperium needs new Imperial Guard regiments raised for conflicts close to the Calixis Sector, Scintilla's tithe is often raised to include a draft of manpower for the Imperial Guard. This draft is mostly taken from the Army of the Scintillan Protectorate, with some Imperial Guard also being raised from the ultra-violent gangers of Gunmetal City's notorious Infernis. Since the Scintillan troops often cut their teeth battling the Infernis gangs, care must be taken to keep the resulting Imperial Guard regiments apart. The Army of the Scintillan Protectorate, while answering to Hax in his role as planetary governor, is effectively sponsored by the noble families who contribute their household troops to tours in the army, and most of its officer class is drawn from the younger sons and daughters of noble houses. Warrior brotherhoods, secret societies often born of loyalties to a particular noble house, are common in the army, with the most prestigious having fraternal meeting houses in the spire of Hive Tarsus.

# **The Cathedral of Illumination**

Hive Tarsus is also the site of one of Scintilla's sectorfamous landmarks. The Cathedral of Illumination is the most important place of worship in the whole Calixis Sector. It is the base of operations for Cardinal Ignato, the sector's most senior Adeptus Ministorum clergyman, who leads the Synod Calixis from the cathedral's lavish auditorium. The cathedral is an extraordinary collection of spires surrounding a cavernous central nave, topped with an enormous stainedglass dome, through which the scorching light of Scintilla's equatorial sun blazes. The decoration on the cathedral is paid for by nobles and prominent citizens from across the sector, all eager to purchase a piece of the Emperor's grace. The outside of the cathedral is covered in statues, depicting scenes of Imperial history and images of the saints, all gleaming gold in the fierce sunlight. It is said that some of the cathedral's least accessible places conceal bizarre statues, like grotesque Ambulon monsters or scenes of bizarre occult rituals. The area around the cathedral is a forest of statues of saints and important citizens of Scintilla, the most impressive of these being an enormous statue of Saint Drusus that has pride of place outside the main doors to the nave.

Inside, the cathedral is just as magnificent. The cavernous nave's glass dome is supported by columns carved into the likenesses of past cardinals and there are enough pews to sit tens of thousands of worshippers. The nave is dominated by an altar that sits in front of a triple portrait in gold and silver, depicting the Emperor (with His face turned from the congregation) flanked by Saint Drusus and Lord Militant Angevin, as well as effigies of several saints. Behind the altar is a choir of two thousand servitors filling the nave with soaring choruses. A pulpit overlooks the nave, and it is from here that Ignato and the other Ministorum preachers speak the word of the Emperor. On days of religious importance, such as the Feast of the Emperor's Ascension, many thousands of nobles and adepts from across Scintilla fill the nave, while lesser citizens crowd outside in the hope of glimpsing some of the splendour within.

The cathedral also contains the cardinal's quarters, the Synod Auditorium, where the sector's cardinals meet to discuss spiritual issues, and the Hall of Relics where holy items are kept for safekeeping and study. These include relics of Saint Drusus's life, including bones purported to be from Drusus's own body (enough to reconstruct several skeletons). The Archivum Spiritual, a library of theological works and religious records, also resides below the cathedral, as do the extensive catacombs where members of the Ecclesiarchy are buried. The cathedral has a huge staff made up of both lay volunteers (mostly ex-pilgrims) and members of the Ecclesiarchy. Armed laymen of the Frateris Militia protect the cathedral, assisted by a single squad of Sisters of Battle from the Order of the Ebon Chalice.

The presence of the cathedral means that the Ecclesiarchy has immense influence in Hive Tarsus, to the extent that Cardinal Ignato has more power here than the hive's nobles and the Frateris Militia have a stronger presence on the streets than the Magistratum. All the trade and warehousing halls of the middle hive have lay clergy preaching to the workers about the sacred nature of obedience and the heinous sins of leisure and curiosity. A large proportion of Hive Tarsus's population is made up of pilgrims who are journeying through the city to reach the Cathedral of Illumination. Queues of pilgrims snake from the cathedral throughout the middle hive, sometimes spending years waiting for a glimpse of the cathedral while surviving off the efforts of Ecclesiarchy handouts, lay volunteers and unscrupulous traders. The pilgrims are an essential part of Hive Tarsus's economy and most never leave, finding themselves among the labourers of the middle hive or, for a lucky few, working as volunteers among the glittering majesty of the cathedral itself. Hive Sibellus may be the seat of power, but Hive Tarsus is the seat of faith, despite many attempts to shift the Ecclesiarchy's base to the ruling hive. Almost single-handedly, the cathedral accounts for Hive Tarsus's continued importance and inuence in the shadow of its giant rival.

# **AMBULON**

Ambulon is a bizarre sight indeed, claimed by many to be a hive in its own right. The entire city is mounted on the back of a machine that slowly walks across the unstable rocky regions in the centre of Scintilla's main continent. The machine is extremely old, and was almost certainly already on Scintilla when the Imperium conquered the Calixis Sector. It is probably a pre-Imperial artefact, constructed by a civilisation that fell before the foundation of the Imperium, though some claim it is a relic of pre-Heresy terraforming technologies. Certainly the skeletal ruins of moving constructs similar to Ambulon dot the central steppes. Ambulon's unusual form affects every aspect of life in the city, from the industries that employ its middle-class citizens to the city's customs and folklore.

# **Control of Ambulon**

Ambulon is navigated via a huge and very complicated control centre, powered by arcane engines of incredibly occult design, in the area corresponding to its head. The Guild Peripatetica, highly superstitious engineers who keep the secrets of how to control the citadel-mechanicus, are constantly scrambling about the intricate controls making tiny adjustments to keep the edifice moving. Many tales of hive folklore dwell on the terrible consequences should Ambulon ever stop, varying from the city simply collapsing, to the machines becoming self-aware and devouring the humans clinging to its back. The noble houses quarrel constantly over what orders to give to the guild, but they are also well aware that they should not bully or otherwise cross the Guild Peripatetica lest the engineers point them towards a crevasse or other dangerous obstacle and hold the citadel to ransom. The path that the machine takes is crucial to harvesting the deposits of oil, natural gas and precious stones that form Ambulon's contribution to Scintilla's tithe, and everyone has an opinion about where it should go next. Ambulon stalks the wastelands, mining and harvesting the planet's natural resources, supplying the manufactories of Hive Sibellus and the foundries of Gunmetal City. Neither could function without Ambulon's resources. Ambulon tours the steppe wastes once every twenty-eight months, slowing to minute speeds in order to dock with Sibellus and Gunmetal City for a few days to offload ore and mineral resources. Between these celebrated ceremonial times of docking, Ambulon supplies Sibellus and Gunmetal City by way of regular land trains: ore-cargo crawler pods many kilometres long.

# **Life on Ambulon**

Ambulon's constant movement means that even the most solid buildings are in danger of being shaken off the city's structure. This in turn means that the city's wealthiest and most important districts are located in the places where they are least likely to be destroyed, especially along the citymachine's Spine. The Spine's buildings are rarely as big as on hive spires, since space is at such a premium on Ambulon's carapace, nor are they as tall, as they have to endure the constant swaying of the city-machine's slow, rolling gait. The style of the Spine sees elegance and even minimalism preferred to the grotesquely grandiose ornamentation common in the great hives. The nobles of Hive Sibellus, in particular, consider Ambulon to be a cultural backwater, whose nobles neglect the proper pursuits of beautifying their city and venerating their dead.

Ambulon's equivalent of the middle hivers are the hundreds of thousands of workers who inhabit tenement blocks piled up on the vast, shield-shaped back of the city-machine. These tenements are plagued by cityquakes caused by the city's movement, and are all shored up and extensively repaired after past collapses. Few streets run between Ambulon's buildings since there is not enough space for them, so the middle classes tramp to work across the roofs of the tenements, or even through each others' homes. Almost all the middle classers are engaged in harvesting or refining the raw materials that Ambulon gathers from the igneous wastes. The "head" of the city is equipped with immense drills that can be lowered into the rock, and when the city strikes oil, thousands of flexible pipelines are lowered from the edge of the city to pipe up as much of the oil as possible as the city-machine passes by. Working on these pipelines, which are controlled by webs of chains like the strings of vast puppets, is very dangerous and requires a hardy breed of men and women with no fear of heights. Ambulon's many refineries process this oil into promethium fuel, some of which is piped back into the city-machine, while most forms the majority of the city's tithe contribution, to be delivered to Hive Sibellus and Gunmetal City. Other citizens sift through the rock thrown up by the drilling to pick out precious stones, which are then worked into industrial components, or cut for jewellery in workshops inhabited by generations of gemcutters (considered a hereditary occupation on Ambulon). Ambulon's lack of space means that every citizen must justify his presence there and unemployment is illegal. Each household in the middle city is tied to a particular refinery, workshop or other industry, and its members may not work anywhere else. It is vitally important for every middle citizen to be properly recorded in the Rolls of Justification which each place of industry maintains, because if they cannot prove to the authorities of the Spine that they are permitted to fulfil the role in which they work, they are banished to the Underbelly.

Ambulon's "underhive" clings precariously to the belly of the city-machine. It is known by a variety of colourful names such as the Underbelly, the Guts, the Vitals or the Hivegroin. Clusters of hovels blister down from the city-machine like warts, connected by makeshift catwalks and rope bridges. Many thousands of people live only a footstep away from plummeting to their deaths towards the rocky ground that constantly grinds by hundreds of metres below. Underbelly settlements are often scraped off the city-machine's underside by ridges or peaks that the city-machine walks over, or are simply shaken off by the city's movement. Life is short and very difficult here, and the Gutscum live off the detritus of the carapace above, constructing scoops to catch the effluent and waste thrown off the edge of the city, or they form bandit gangs to prey on the citizens who work near the edge of the city-machine's back. One prominent feature of the Underbelly is the cages hung from the edge of the city above containing prisoners condemned to the much-feared punishment of "dangling". The prisoners are locked in a cage attached to a long chain, which is then flung off the edge of the city-machine and left to dangle, swaying with the city's movement, until the prisoner starves and the cage is hauled back up. Hundreds of dangled prisoners hang from the city at any one time, and the Gutscum sometimes use them as target practice or, on very rare occasions, "rescue" them to induct them into Underbelly gangs, enslave them or pit them against one another in bloody gladiatorial fights. Ambulon folklore maintains that some dangled prisoners have survived for months hanging below the city, thanks to divine intervention from the Emperor, and were released when the cage was brought back up again to live saintly lives. In practical terms, however, dangling is a cruel, drawn-out death sentence.

# **GUNMETAL CITY**

Gunmetal City is a huge industrial mass, built into the crater of an immense volcano, Mount Thollos, that rises from the smouldering lava fields of the northern coast. A mere megapolis compared to the planet's two great hives, Gunmetal City's spires tower high above the volcano's peak, while its lowest districts delve right down into Scintilla's crust.

# **Metallican Society**

Gunmetal City is a place of soaring steel, with towers like great, tarnished silver needles piercing the sky. The volcano's crater limits the size of the city's foundation, so nobles have built upwards, the most prestigious locations being perched precariously on slender columns of steel hundreds of metres high. The city is frequently bathed in smoke from the foundries of the middle city below and the houses employ small armies of menials whose job is to scour the surfaces of the skybound mansions until they gleam. Clean air is a valued commodity, with every mansion having powerful filtration systems to cut out the smoke, while the most ostentatious hosts pipe air imported from cleaner worlds into their magnificent homes.

The middle level of the city is dominated by immense foundries powered by the heat from the heart of Mount Thollos. Almost all of Gunmetal City's middle classers work in these foundries over cauldrons of molten metal or blazing furnaces the size of tenement blocks. Gunmetal City's main export is munitions, and endless crates of weapons emerge from its foundries, forming an important part of Scintilla's tithe to the Imperium as well as arming many of the Calixis Sector's own planetary defence force troops. The foundries are sweltering, filthy places where accidents are common and even a fortunate worker's life is shortened by decades thanks to the choking air and cruel environment. The middle classers' homes are clustered around the foundries and often fashioned from cargo containers. People are an afterthought in Gunmetal City. The foundries and the weapons they produce form the real purpose behind the place.

The Infernis is a region formed by the lowest levels of factories that have collapsed or become uninhabitable. This far down, the city is unbearably hot and prone to floods of lava or toxic gas from Mount Thollos's occasional lurches out of dormancy. The gangs of the Infernis are the toughest and best-armed on Scintilla and almost no one else lives there save hardbitten killers toting weapons extorted from the middle hivers. There is nothing to live for in the Infernis save superiority over enemy gangs, and so gang warfare is literally a way of life.

# **The Lawless City**

In truth, Gunmetal City is an upstart. Younger and far, far smaller than the dominant hives, Gunmetal is a feral community that thrives simply because of what it produces. Hives Sibellus and Tarsus tolerate it because of its export materials. It is a jumped-up, uncivilized boomtown in the Wilderness, a city that got too big for itself. One day, in a thousand years' time, it might become powerful enough to challenge for the dominance of Scintilla. For now, it is a four billion strong foundry station where law is slack and noble houses fight, literally, for ownership of lucrative mercantile output. Of all the main population centres on Scintilla, Gunmetal City is the most dangerous and lawless.

The gun is everywhere in Gunmetal City, from the weapons churned out by its foundries, to the symbols of the city's noble houses and the guns carried by almost every citizen. Gunfighting is a leisure activity, with designated areas throughout the city set aside for shoot-outs. Duels in Gunmetal are fought with pistols, and a great many people, especially from the middle hives where life is quite short anyway, seek out brief but glorious careers as gunfighters. Shots ring around the foundries of the middle city incessantly and the nobles often hire prestigious gunslingers to battle in elaborate arenas while the audience watches from behind bulletproof screens. Some of the best gunslingers come from Infernis, and it is little wonder that the gangers adore their guns so much when expertise in their use brings such wealth and status.

# **THE WILDERNESS**

The hive inhabitants refer to the areas outside the great hives as "the Wilderness". This is something of a misnomer, as there are a great many settlements outside the hives, but certainly none of them can compare to the importance of the great hives themselves. Scintilla's natural resources have either been drained long ago or are monopolised by the great hives and Ambulon, so many people exist as nomads. Those permanent settlements that do exist are often founded by mercenaries, who lived by selling their services to the land trains that crisscross the planet. The mercenaries, easily recognisable by the white bands painted or tattooed across their faces, are essential to providing security against the more predatory nomad tribes. Land trains consist of dozens of huge tracked vehicles that crawl in from hive to hive transporting goods and passengers. Some land trains even cross Scintilla's oceans, loading their vehicles onto great barges for risky journeys across polluted waters with their fair share of predators and pirates.

With resources in short supply away from the hives, settlements can grow up and die out rapidly. Few survive for more than a generation and the Wilderness is studded with ghost towns. In some places, on the very fringes of Scintilla's habitable lands, small communities continue to exist as they have done for centuries far from the shadow of the great hives. These people have often been in the same place for centuries. Isolated and ignored by Scintilla's authorities, they live in ignorance that the hives exist at all, much less that they live in a galactic empire ruled from distant Terra. Scholars of the Magnopticon sometimes send expeditions out to search for such benighted peoples, in the hope that studying them will reveal some secrets about the pre-Imperial history of Scintilla.

The most extraordinary feature of the Wilderness is the ruin of Hive Tenebra. This necropolis was once the heart of Scintilla's high culture and arts, built around a circle of stepped pyramids rising like enormous altars from the steaming jungles of Scintilla's equator. The hive is now a titanic mass of wreckage gradually being reclaimed by the voracious jungle. The disaster that claimed Hive Tenebra along with millions of lives happened over eight centuries ago, and is thought by most to have been caused by a collapse of the geothermal heatsinks that provided it with power. There is no shortage of conspiracy theories about what "really" happened to the hive, however, ranging from ill-advised summonings of warp creatures to a deliberate act of sabotage by agents of the Imperium. Tales about its destruction are outnumbered only by stories about what might lurk in the ruins now: ravenous monsters, renegade nobles and hordes of hideous mutants ruled by a mighty deformed overlord. No one ventures close to Hive Tenebra with any regularity, and when they do they rarely penetrate into the collapsed interior of the hive where the foulest horrors are said to lurk.

# Guns of Gunmetal

A few of the guns produced by Gunmetal City are famous*,* either through their iconic nature or exceptional performance. These guns are status symbols, especially for the Infernis gangers, and are carried by officers of the Scintillan army as side arms. The Thollos Service Autopistol, or the "Tholl", is an autopistol that sacrifices capacity for stopping power and is much coveted by Magistratum officers in particular. The Scalptaker on the other hand, is a very solidly built and extremely uncomplicated slug pistol designed for use by just about anyone. It is such a common weapon that any self-respecting ganger will try to upgrade his Scalptaker, even though it is a very easily maintained weapon designed to survive the rigours of the Infernis. The Fykos Forge Nomad Hunting Instrument is one of the most precise and well-calibrated weapons produced in Gunmetal City, and is the rifle of choice for hunters who stalk big game in Scintilla's wastelands. Procuring a "Nomad" costs an enormous amount of money and involves a five-year waiting list. Finally, the Blackhammer Defence Shotgun is a brutal, massive bore shotgun that can blast holes in doors and shred opponents. Its limited range and single-shot capacity do little to diminish its value as a weapon of intimidation in the hands of hardened criminals and enforcers.

# IOCANTHOS

**Population:** 5 billion (estimated). **Tithe Grade:** Exactus Median. **Geography:** Four main continents and extensive island chains. Only the largest continent is populated (mountainous/rocky, dense southern forests. Largely arid climate with frequent dust storms). Very few sources of fresh water.

#### **Government Type:** None/Tribal.

**Planetary Governor:** Vervai ("King") Skull.

**Adept Presence:** Very low. Adepta Sororitas (Commandery at the Abbey of the Dawn), Administratum (Port Suffering).

**Military:** Massive armies in service of warlords. Large mercenary presence.

**Trade:** Iocanthos's only meaningful export is Ghostfire pollen. The Ghostfire harvest is essential to the existence of the Imperial Guard penal legions in the Segmentum Obscurus.

Iocanthos is a lawless world dominated by warlords and their huge armies, which clash across its jungles, forests and plains. The planet's importance in the Calixis Sector is defined by the fact that it is one of the few places in the Imperium where the Ghostfire flower can grow. Ghostfire pollen can be refined into the combat drugs used extensively in the penal legions of the Imperial Guard.

Iocanthos's warlords (usually styling themselves "vai" or tribal prince) battle constantly for control of the Ghostfire harvest. The Ghostfire crop cannot be cultivated normally and so once a patch of it is harvested another one must be found. The warlords' armies are therefore constantly on the move, travelling in enormous hordes across Iocanthos's main continent and clashing violently wherever they meet. Iocanthos's wide plains, dense, dark forests and forbidding mountain passes are studded with old battlefields where burned-out vehicles and age-bleached skeletons abound.

Every five years, a taskforce of Administratum officials descends onto Iocanthos to gather the planet's Ghostfire tithe. The warlords exchange their harvests of Ghostfire pollen with the Administratum in exchange for weapons, vehicles, fuel, clean water and other essentials. The warlord who hands over the most Ghostfire pollen is considered the planetary governor and claims the lion's share of support from the Imperium and the title Vervai (literally "prince of princes" or "king"). The title brings with it immense prestige and confirms the warlord's position as the most dangerous and skilled on Iocanthos. The current planetary governor is "King" Skull, a terrifying warrior at the head of an enormous and supposedly invincible army of madmen and killers. The warlords of Iocanthos are also required to hand over their psykers as well as the Ghostfire harvest, but these are taken from them not by the Administratum but by nameless greyuniformed men who herd the psykers onto their sleek black ship and take their leave.

The Administratum fully accepts the situation on Iocanthos. The Ghostfire pollen is harvested very efficiently because so many warlords' armies battle to find every last blossom. Were the Administratum to take over Iocanthos themselves, the planet would first have to be conquered by the Imperial Guard at enormous expense and the Administratum themselves would be hard-pressed to match the vigour with which Iocanthos's warlords hunt down every Ghostfire flower. They therefore leave the warlords to do the hard work, safe in the knowledge that none of them can rebel against Imperial authority lest their supplies of guns and fuel be cut off.

# **PORT SUFFERING**

Port Suffering, the largest permanent settlement on Iocanthos, is a sturdy fortified town that serves as the base for Imperial operations on Iocanthos. The town's largest and most important feature is its spaceport, an expanse of rockcrete broken by docking clamps and refuelling ports that can accommodate the landing craft that deliver supplies and pick up Ghostfire shipments. Equally important for the people living in Port Suffering are the huge freshwater tanks beneath the town. Freshwater is very valuable on Iocanthos, and Port Suffering not only has its own supply brought down on Imperial ships, but can trade its surplus water to the warlords (mainly for guarantees that the warlords will not attack the town). Port Suffering's architecture is based around a standard hab-block pattern since most of its buildings, from the chapel to the accommodation blocks, were dropped from spaceships directly to the surface when the town was first founded as an Imperial trading post. Its dry, dusty streets and prefabricated rust-red buildings are home to a community mostly geared towards maintaining the spaceport and ensuring that the port remains self-sufficient.

The town's population is broadly Emperor-fearing and law-abiding, and they attend the town's chapel and send their children to the seminary school run by Preacher Goudt. The largest building in Port Suffering is the Administratum counting-house where the town's small body of adepts calculates the projected Ghostfire crop and receives envoys from the various warlords. The under-consul in charge of the counting-house, Adept Sabetha Kosloff, serves as the de facto mayor of Port Suffering, sometimes against her will as she is not very good at dealing with townsfolk and would rather stick to ensuring that the Emperor's forms are correctly filed. Other important citizens include the sharp-tongued but compassionate Sister Xanthe, the Sister Hospitaller who runs Port Suffering's hospital along with a small staff of inexperienced laymen. Unkind rumours suggest that Sister Xanthe was given her thankless post as a punishment by her canoness at the Abbey of the Dawn.

Port Suffering's walls are always manned by the citizens who serve in the Port Militia. The town's greatest protection, however, is the fact that it is considered neutral by most of Iocanthos's warlords. If Port Suffering was to be attacked, the more powerful warlords would lose their supply of weapons, freshwater and fuel from the Imperium and what little structure that exists on Iocanthos would fall apart. Some lesser warlords eye the support received by the more powerful with jealousy, however, and endlessly plan to launch devastating raids on Port Suffering. Should this ever happen, the stoutness of the town's defences and the dedication of its well-armed but inexperienced militia will be sorely tested.

# **THE LEVIES OF KING SKULL THE MAGNIFICENT**

King Skull, as Vervai, is the most powerful man on Iocanthos and styles himself on the legendary warrior-kings from the planet's history. In truth, the great ages of martial kingship are long past, with the old traditions have been bastardised into the modern, ruthless business of controlling the Ghostfire commerce.

Nevertheless, King Skull's army is many millions strong and dominates huge swathes of Iocanthos's main continent at any one time. Skull himself is a tall, saturnine man clad in elaborate black steel armor, wielding a huge spear with a head cut from the flint of Iocanthos's highest peak. "Skull" is clearly a deliberately assumed name—the Vervai's tribal banner is a bleached human skull—though there is little clue as to his real name, as his origins are very obscure and are the subject of considerable speculation. Some say he is a deposed noble who fled to Iocanthos to avoid some scandal or tragedy, others that he is a dangerous fugitive criminal who found his true calling among the warlords and madmen. Most rumours centre around his supposed capabilities in battle. Skull is undoubtedly a tenacious warrior, but tales whispered in Iocanthos's frontier towns hint at far more, such as allegations that he drinks blood to gain strength from his enemies, or is a powerful witch who can summon mighty storms of black lightning down on his foes. Skull's rule is based on the immense loyalty the core of his army feels towards him. Warriors must first prove themselves in battle before they are ever armed with the weapons and equipment that Skull acquires in return for the Ghostfire harvest. As they demonstrate prowess in battle, they are further armed and drawn towards the core of battle-hardened, well-equipped veterans of the Harrowguard who surround Skull himself. Skull leads these warriors into battle personally, and the sight of his black-armored form is enough to demoralise those unfortunate enough to meet the Harrowguard in battle.

# **Life in the Horde**

King Skull's army welcomes all as long as they are willing to fight their first battles armed with little more than sticks and stones. Skull deploys huge numbers of new, expendable troops to swamp the enemy while the Harrowguard function as shock troops. Skull's army in battle is a terrible thing to witness, with swarms of madmen hurling themselves upon the enemy while the better-armed sections of the army fire volleys of lasgun shots into the shocked enemy or charge alongside the Vervai himself.

Skull's army travels on a number of huge, smoke-belching vehicles. The Throne is Skull's personal transport, which was once a huge-tracked mining vehicle, refitted to function as a mobile throne room and prison for captured enemies. This sootstained monstrosity is festooned with captured banners and other trophies, and Skull himself sits on a throne platform suspended over hundreds of cages where his prisoners languish. Skull sells these prisoners back to their families or comrades in exchange for Ghostfire pollen or offers them a place in the ill-armed hordes of his army. Those who are good for neither Ghostfire nor fighting are left to rot, their sobs and screams accompanying

Seth the Voice the Vervai everywhere he goes. Another mobile landmark is the Sanctum, a tower supported by a raft of lashed-together Chimera vehicles. It is home to Gurgerin, the Vervai's advisor and, it is widely assumed, a sorcerer whose divinations are essential to Skull's plans. The Sanctum is a stone tower pulled from some long-forgotten mountain ruin, said to be full of bewildering and grotesque experiments (or captive aliens, shambling warp monstrosities or a cabal of the Calixis Sector's rich and powerful, depending on which stories you believe). Gurgerin, a man of extremely advanced age with tiny glinting eyes like specks of flint, can sometimes be seen on the Sanctum's uppermost battlements watching the vast throng of the army marching beneath him. Several other massive vehicles, used either to house the Harrowguard or to transport the precious Ghostfire crop, travel alongside the army, often hung with trophies or the weathered corpses of particularly hated enemies.

# **SETH THE VOICE**

One of the largest and newest armies of Iocanthos is that led by Seth the Voice, self-styled Prophet of the Emperor and figurehead of an apocalyptic splinter cult of the Imperial Creed. Vai ("prince") Seth is almost certainly an ex-adept, probably from Port Suffering's Administratum contingent, who became convinced that the Emperor was granting him visions that demanded he immediately take over Iocanthos. Since then, through force of personality and by tapping into Iocanthos' need for religion and redemption, Seth has forged a ragtag but huge army with which he is challenging the most powerful rival warlords, especially that of the great Vervai.

Vai Seth himself is a slight, balding, bespectacled figure in white robes. He travels in a battered old scout vehicle converted into a mobile pulpit from which he can preach. And preach he does, almost constantly, his voice transmitted by bulky vox-units carried by his devout followers. The passion with which Seth exhorts the people of Iocanthos to claim the planet for their Emperor is genuine and convincing.

Everywhere he goes he gathers more souls for his army, be they drifters looking for a purpose or hard-bitten mercenaries searching for a way to redeem themselves of their many sins. Seth is not a soldier, but he has a gift for getting others to fight for him that is so profound that it might as well have been granted by the Emperor Himself.

# **The Army of the Voice**

Vai Seth's army is ill-equipped, undertrained and frequently starving. It is, however, uniquely motivated, for all its members believe that fighting for Seth will grant them a far better afterlife than is awaiting all the galaxy's other sinners. The Army of the Voice, uniquely, has no problem getting new members to replace its frequent losses, as even defeated enemies are sometimes swayed to join by Seth's impassioned preaching. The army travels on many hundreds of vehicles, most of them looted from enemies or donated by recruits, and as a result it is constantly in the throes of a critical fuel shortage. Capturing more fuel is essential to the army's continued existence.

The men and women of the army are as varied as the sins they are trying to cleanse, but they all wear white robes, or at least they did when they joined up, for the constant travel and fighting means that most of them are actually dressed in dirty greys. Some are armed with lasguns and other reliable weapons, but most have the hunting rifles or stub pistols they were armed with when recruited. The most experienced fighters, normally exmercenaries or recruits from other warlords' armies, are referred to as Seth's "Saints" and are the focal points of the army, instructing the enthusiastic, but often clueless, faithful in the best ways to avoid dying too quickly. In spite of the army's inexperience it is a formidable military force. As well as having the numbers and the determination, the effect of Seth's own presence seems to demoralise enemy troops and even cause them to flee or mutiny. Mercenaries in particular are a superstitious lot, and even an experienced killer can baulk at the idea of killing a man who so convincingly claims to be a holy man ordained by the Emperor's will.

# **THE ABBEY OF THE DAWN**

The Abbey of the Dawn is the Adepta Sororitas' main training facility in the Calixis Sector. A spectacular fortress of pale yellow ouslite built into the knife-like slopes of a dark flint mountain, the abbey is the most secure place on Iocanthos. Its location means that, while it is close to the heartland of the Calixis Sector, its immediate surroundings are bleak and rugged, and the abbey's Sisters are cut off from the corruptive influences of the outside world.

The abbey's purpose is to train initiates into fully-fledged Sisters, who then go on to perform devotional works across the Calixis Sector and beyond. The abbey is run by Canoness Goneril, who leads the Lesser Order Famulous of the Opening Eye. The Opening Eye's purpose is to offer counsel to the Calixis Sector's powerful noble families. Most novices at the abbey are trainees of the Opening Eye and are schooled in a variety of subjects from Imperial history to theology and sector economics. Most importantly they are trained in the strength of mind to resist the secular temptations that are a constant threat to the Sisters Famulous. A Sister Famulous must be disciplined and incorruptible as she is sent out to fend mostly for herself, and is surrounded by the sometimes morally questionable nobles to whose house she is attached. Canoness Goneril has her novices undergo a strict regime of fasting, prayer, lectures and theological study. She stops short of outright cruelty, but life is far from easy for a novice of the Opening Eye. Goneril's Mistress of Novices, the formidable Sister Gert, is a physically intimidating reminder of a Sister's duty to obey her order at all times.

The Abbey of the Dawn is also home to a Mission of Sisters of Battle from the Order of the Ebon Chalice, who are led by Palatine Rhiannon. The Ebon Chalice is based on Holy Terra, and the Battle Sisters at the abbey, even if they have only glimpsed the spires of the Imperium's holiest world, are regarded with something like religious awe by the novices. Their duties include maintaining the Sororitas honour guard at the Cathedral of Illumination on Scintilla and guarding important Ecclesiarchy adepts who visit the Calixis Sector. Both Canoness Goneril and Palatine Rhiannon are adherents to the long-standing agreement between the Adepta Sororitas and the Ordo Hereticus, and would willingly lend the Battle Sisters' martial prowess to an

Inquisitorial operation should it be needed. Lord Inquisitor Zerbe of the Calixian Conclave does not take this agreement lightly and will not permit the Sisters of the Ebon Chalice to be sent to battle by an Inquisitor unless it is absolutely necessary. Though they number only around fifty, Rhiannon's Sisters of the Ebon Chalice are the most elite and dedicated troops in the Calixis Sector.

# **THE BADLANDS**

This is the rugged interior of Iocanthos, bounded to the south by dense forests and the sea, and to the north by the jagged flint mountains. The Badlands are an endless sweep of plains, scrub and steppe where most of the Ghostfire crops can be found and where the warlords clash. It is dotted with battlefields, some of them no more than a tangle of recently slain bodies and others titanic fields of bones and burned-out wrecks. A fortunate and hardy individual can make a good living scavenging these battlefields to find valuables and weapons to sell. Iocanthos's folklore is full of the tales of the sticky ends experienced by such scavengers, from dread curses to old-fashioned walking dead, and most normal folk stay away from these battlefields.

# SEPHERIS SECUNDUS

**Population:** 12 billion.

**Tithe Grade:** Exactus Extremis. **Geography:** Planet-wide overcontinent, small polar oceans. Mountainous, forested, extensive areas of open mine workings. Arctic climate, atmosphere moisture-laden and blizzards constant. Three moons, none inhabited.

**Government Type:** Feudal monarchy. **Planetary Governor:** Queen Lachryma III.

**Adept Presence:** Very low. Some Adeptus Ministorum clergy, Adeptus Arbites Precinct-Fortress.

**Military:** Royal Scourges, Baronial armies, noble private armies. Poor/medium quality.

**Trade:** Sepheris Secundus is the largest exporting planet in the Calixis Sector. Without its massive exports of ore, metals and fuel, the trade of the Calixis Sector could not function. Sepheris Secundus relies on imports of food from the sector's agri-worlds. Its vast population makes it a potential supplier of Imperial Guard recruits, although a relatively small proportion of the population would be suitable because of universally poor health, along with the risk of exposing the subjugated masses to the possibility of life outside the mines.

Sepheris Secundus is a world of immense mineral wealth, city-sized mines, billions-strong hordes of serfs and the sharpest divide between the elites and the masses in the Calixis Sector. It is a grim place of snow and twilight, feral mutants and lives spent in back-breaking labour deep beneath the ground. The Imperium's eagerness to exploit Sepheris Secundus's vast resources is such that the planet is at the same time the richest and poorest world in the sector.

Sepheris Secundus's climate is cold and stormy, its surface obscured by a mantle of cloud. It has no oceans save for the small polar seas, so the moisture in its atmosphere comes from below the crust, spewed out from failed mine workings or natural geysers that pockmark the planet like pustules. Its surface is split between the vast open mines like deep scars in the crust and the dense, snow-laden forests broken only by the ruins of failed kingdoms that tried to claim Sepheris Secundus in the past. With its endless blizzards, widespread ignorance and antiquated methods for doing everything, Sepheris Secundus would be a meaningless backwater were it not for the enormous mineral wealth beneath its surface.

# **THE SUFFERING KINGDOM**

While the whole Imperium is a feudal empire, feudalism is an extreme on Sepheris Secundus. Everyone born on the planet must have a master to whom they pay nine-tenths of

everything they produce, which for most citizens means the ore they hack from the rock faces of the planet's mines. Queen Lachryma III, the planet's absolute monarch, sits at the top of this feudal system. The rights to the labour of these billions of serfs belong to the barons appointed by the queen or to noble families and business consortiums that purchase them from the crown. The queen's own master is the Imperium, to whom she hands over truly staggering amounts of ore, metals and raw fuel to fulfil the planet's tithe. Sepheris Secundus's tithe is the highest in the Calixis Sector, and without its immense output of raw materials, the economy of the whole province would be badly unsettled.

Two principal forces maintain Sepheris Secundus's feudal system. The first is the weight of tradition: every serf labouring in the mines is doing what his father did and his grandfather before that, often at the same rock face. Mothers tell their children tales about the horrible fates met by disobedient serfs who deny the demands of their masters, and the lay preachers who administer the Imperial creed describe no greater sin than having ideas above one's station.

The second force is physical violence. One of the reasons that Sepheris Secundus's culture is so primitive by many standards is that weaponry and other technology is monopolised by the crown. The queen's Royal Scourges are equipped with lasguns, grenades and chainblades, contrasting with their gaudy, stained-glass-like armor. Though few in number, the technological advantage that these troops possess has been enough to put down a great many uprisings in the mines of Sepheris Secundus, and the planet's history is littered with massacres where thousands of serfs fell to volleys of lasgun fire. The barons each have their own forces, some of which are permitted to use a few high-tech weapons, although most of them are armed with primitive but well-made weapons and armor with which to enforce the baronial will. Meanwhile, when the serfs rise up, they do so with improvised weapons and mining equipment. The serfs, even when roused to violence in significant numbers, have never held one of Sepheris Secundus's mines for very long because of the massive superiority in equipment and training possessed by the forces of their masters. When the baronial armies fail, the Royal Scourges do not. The Royal Scourges answer directly to the queen, which also makes them ideal for keeping the barons themselves in line. Many an overambitious baron has refused to send the queen her rightful tribute, only to find his supposedly elite army cut to pieces by the Royal Scourges.

# **The Rule of Law**

Order upon Sepheris Secundus is enforced by the troops of the various barons. While Sepheris Secundus has some generally observed laws—a serf who strikes his master will usually be put to death, for example—each baron enforces his own laws in his own way, and some do not bother at all as long as there is no open rebellion. Other barons, by contrast, have troops patrolling the upper mines ensuring that no one wears the wrong colour on the wrong day, spits in the street or fails to use the traditional forms of address. In Icenholm, the capital, the Royal Scourges enforce order and are also sent to restore obedience where it has broken down.

# **ICENHOLM**

Sepheris Secundus's capital is Icenholm, a wondrous city built into the mountain crags that loom over the vast smoking pit of the Gorgonid Mine. Icenholm's glass spires encrust the mountain peak like a crown, bathed in an otherworldly light. This light is actually concentrated on Icenholm by a series of enormous reflecting mirrors positioned around the peaks overlooking the Gorgonid Mine, an expensive and complicated process that makes it look as if the light of some distant heaven is shining directly onto the capital.

The main body of the city is suspended between three vast peaks on thousands of thick cables and chains, like a glittering jewel upon a complex necklace. The origins of this unusual structure are not recorded anywhere, but a common theory is that it was built around the core of an enormous warship that docked there during Angevin's crusade and never left, the hive growing up around it like a pearl around a speck of grit. Many buildings dangle from the city's mass, reaching down hundreds of metres towards the floor of the valley below the city like strands of hanging moss.

Gorgonid Mins

Icenholm is constructed of stained glass that shines in a dazzling array of colours in the sunlight. Its spires house some of the most senior barons along with members of the royal family. The majority of Icenholm's population is made up of hereditary servants, pledged to either the queen or one of her barons. They form small armies of clerks who ensure that the planet's barons are offering up the correct tithes to their queen, and attend to other matters of governance such as the regulation of heraldry. These servants have their own hierarchies, with the queen's own servants very much in charge. They wear the liveries of their masters, which in the case of the queen's servants is red (red is a colour reserved for royal use on Sepheris Secundus—anyone else wearing it is likely to be arrested by baronial troops). Icenholm's gates do not open to just anyone, so while adepts and barons will be received into Icenholm anyone else will have to sweet-talk the hereditary family of gate servants who are difficult to impress.

 The peak of Icenholm is taken up by the palace, which consists of the various chambers of state along with Queen Lachryma's own quarters. The throne room is spectacular indeed, set beneath a soaring spire of stained glass depicting the glories of Sepheris Secundus's past monarchs. The throne itself is of ice kept permanently frozen, and the voluminous royal robes which the queen wears are partly to keep her from being frozen herself. The queen's chambers are lavishly appointed, with three separate bedrooms alone: one for sleeping, one for promulgating the royal line (not used since the Prince Consort passed away twenty years ago) and one for receiving morning visitors.

Queen Lachryma III

The queen of Sepheris Secundus is an elderly woman who has successfully led Sepheris Secundus through numerous revolts, baronial uprisings and increasingly spectacular tithe demands from the Administratum. Now, however, she is getting old. Though her mind is still sound, her body is infirm and, some of the more ambitious barons say, she is losing the ruthlessness and willpower that once served her so well Queen Lachryma's aged, underweight form is swamped by her royal regalia, with its voluminous gown made from thousands of panes of stained glass and its crown of white gold. Her voice is thin and shaky, and she no longer has the presence that once acted as an anchor for the feudal system of Sepheris Secundus. In her later years, the queen has sunk into the throes of a personal crisis. Why do her serfs have to live such grim lives of toil? Is there another way that Sepheris Secundus could be ruled what actually goes on in the depths of the planet? She has ordered her barons to investigate few of them have sensed weakness and doubt in their queen's mines, but her barons have resisted this and a. Though she would never admit it to anyone, Queen Lachryma is afraid of how she will be remembered, and knows that she is running out of time before she can get to the root causes of Sepheris Secundus's misery.

# **GORGONID MINE**

The Gorgonid is one of Sepheris Secundus's largest and most productive mines. Though it is within sight of Icenholm and the royal palace, the structure and society of the mine itself is typical of many across Sepheris Secundus's surface. The exact population of the Gorgonid is impossible to calculate, but it is vast, consisting of enormous hordes of serfs, most of whom never see the world outside the mine. The Gorgonid is a vast open mine hundreds of metres deep. Rickety scaffolding reaches down into its lower depths, and countless pulleys and cranes lift containers of ore to the edge of the enormous mine pit, where it accumulates in mountainous heaps waiting for cargo ships to transport it off the surface. From the edge of the mine pit can be glimpsed the heaped-up wooden tenements known as the Commons, while cart tracks and well-worn paths lead below the edge of the pit towards the mining areas deep below the ground. Only the central part of the Gorgonid is open to the air. All the mining faces and many homes are below the surface, existing in eternal darkness.

Most inhabitants of the Gorgonid live in the Commons. This is the collective term for the areas of built-up wooden housing where the serfs live. In theory, all of this is owned by the Gorgonid's barons, who allow the serfs to live there in return for nine-tenths of everything the serfs mine. In practice serfs simply live where they can, often cramming large families into a single candle-lit room. The Commons are teeming, but it is not a boisterous, lively place. The serfs go everywhere with their heads bowed, trudging to and from the mine faces, snatching a few moments of rest in the squalor of the Commons. Besides work, sleep and sermons by the lay clergy who represent the Imperial Creed in the Gorgonid, there is very little levity in a serf 's life.

The barons of the Gorgonid live in the Commons, tradition demanding that they live in fastness keeps and small castles. The serfs are expected to show deference to all barons, particularly the one who owns their labour, at all times. A baron travelling through the streets can expect to have serfs present him with small handcrafted trinkets or other gifts. He will then burn these outside the gates of his tower to symbolise the relationship between serf and master. Most barons have large entourages of troops and other servants to ensure that the serfs do not get too close. These include the distinctive Stench Wardens, servants who carry censers of scented water to help fend off the "Commons stink" when a baron must endure walking the poverty-stricken streets.

The Face is the term for those areas where there is ore to be mined, and it is here that most of the Gorgonid's work is done. The Face consists of thousands of kilometres of open rock face stretching deep beneath the ground, from massive cliff faces covered in precarious scaffolding to narrow, stifling tunnels too low for a man to stand upright. Every serf has the right to mine a particular section of open mine, and the Face is covered in markers driven into the rock to state which serf is permitted to work that spot. In times past, the serfs had to chain themselves, or one of their children, to the marker to ensure that the claim was respected. Nowadays, however, a smear of the serf 's blood is enough to demonstrate that the serf is currently working the spot. Serfs must frequently draw blood to renew this mark, hence the process is known as "staking" a claim. The means by which the serfs mine is very primitive. Most use tools handed down by their forefathers, and fortunate is the serf who earns enough from his minuscule portion of the rock's bounty to buy a brand new set of tools. Each morning countless thousands of serfs trudge to the Face from the Commons and every evening they trudge back again, pausing only to pay deference to the barons who tour the Face to ensure that the slothful are punished. When the explosives engineers of the Disassemblers' Guild blast a new area of the Face, a stampede occurs as thousands of serfs rush to stake their new claims. These occasions can be dangerous, as many are trampled or killed in fights over the best claims, but this is accepted as the price for making sure the fittest, most determined serfs mine the most productive seams.

The Shatters is the term given to the deepest, darkest, most dangerous parts of the Gorgonid, which even the barons recognise are too dangerous for serfs to work. Caverns filled with deadly gas, flooded, partially collapsed or simply lethally hot or radioactive can be found in the Shatters. No claim may be staked in the Shatters and ore mined there is not owned by anyone. The Shatters are home to the very lowest of the Gorgonid's low, comprising two main groups. The first consists of the dispossessed: those who have no master, either having been born outside a marriage sanctioned by the barons or condemned to lose even a serf 's meagre rights after being convicted of a crime. These hapless individuals invariably die very quickly in the Shatters. Those who survive to illicitly sell a few handfuls of ore fare well compared to most.

The second group consists of mutants. Mutants are common in the Gorgonid, as on the rest of Sepheris Secundus, perhaps due to the massive amounts of dangerous metals and chemicals that find their way into the dubious water supply. In any case, mutants gravitate towards the Shatters, which is the only place where they can survive in any numbers without being hunted down by baronial troops or burned by torch-wielding serfs. Some mutants are well adapted to the hostile conditions, and a few even thrive in the Shatters. Mutants have their own crude society where seniority is based on brute strength and the degree of mutation. The mutant barons and kings, it is said, are inhuman monsters from the depths of a nightmare, hellish abominations that range from enormous tentacled horrors to three-eyed seers who can read thoughts. The more criminally minded serfs buy the ore mined by the outcasts and mutants in exchange for food and other essentials, and a major part of Sepheris Secundus' economy is made up by the labour of the mutant underclass. It is even possible that more ore comes out of the Shatters than out of the exhausted seams of the Face.

The Tumble is the only area outside the Gorgonid that most of its serfs ever see. It is a wasteland on the surface above the mine, dominated by titanic heaps of rock spoil and other trash. In this polluted twilight, thickly carpeted with toxins, shady deals are made that take place outside the mine's proper feudal economy. These range from serfs selling off their surplus, to organised criminals selling their services as killers or smugglers. The mutants of the Shatters have a tunnel that links to somewhere in the Tumble, and on the darkest nights, shambling, hideous creatures emerge from the poison smog to take their cut. Barons and off-worlders are sometimes known to frequent the Tumble, every one of them eager to hide their identities.

The Gorgonid's large, oppressed population has led to the formation of groups of criminals and other malcontents. The baronial troops eagerly hunt down criminals and execute them on the street corners of the Commons. Other groups are cults and secret societies lurking in the Gorgonid's dark places. The Loathers, for example, is a group that has forsaken all happiness and hope, and sells its services as assassins and destroyers of lives to spread the misery that has afflicted them. Some whisper that cutting off a finger and nailing it to a signpost in the Commons will bring the Loathers to your doorstep when you least expect it, and that you can then bargain with them to destroy someone you despise.

The Orphans' Crusade, on the other hand, searches discreetly for those with unusual abilities, reading minds or precognition for example, and spirits them away before they are handed over to the baronial troops by fearful relatives. No one knows what the Crusade needs these gifted individuals for, but the fate that awaits them can surely be no more sinister than being dragged away by the baronial troops, never to be seen again. The greyhooded agents of the Orphan's Crusade can sometimes be glimpsed at the bloodsport pits popular in the Commons or at the witherhouses where victims of diseases and accidents languish, always looking for something. Perhaps most terrifying of all the Gorgonid's hidden cults, though, is the Granite Crown. This group's sinister symbol of a blinded eye is carved on many entrances to the Shatters and many an old serf miner tells tales of how the Granite Crown rules over even the mightiest of mutant shatterchiefs, who pay fealty to the Granite Crown's lords. These "lords" are said to dwell in the most ancient of places beneath the ground. No one knows where these stories originated, let alone whether they hold any truth, but similar tales are told by firelight all across Sepheris Secundus.

# **Cults and Malcontents** **FATHOMSOUND MINE**

The Fathomsound is the most unusual of Sepheris Secundus's mines. Within its enormous basin is an underground lake upon which float thousands of rafts, barges and lashed-together wooden structures that form the home of Fathomsound's serfs. The frequent blizzards that rip across Sepheris Secundus churn up the waters of the Fathomsound, and many serfs are lost to the freezing waters with every storm. The Flotsam, as this floating city is known, is one of the most povertystricken and desperate places on Sepheris Secundus, with its inhabitants literally clinging to life, permanently ill thanks to the fouled water, and condemned to lives spent in the deadly underwater mines.

The barons of the Fathomsound are obliged by planetary law to live within the mine whose serfs they own, but none would willingly dwell on the dangerous Flotsam. Instead, they live in mansions suspended from the edge of the mine pit, hanging from mighty chains and served by precarious elevators and cable cars. The barons typically enjoy taking caffeine on the balconies along the lower surface of these extraordinary homes, from where the Fathomsound is a spectacular sight and its poverty and dangers are not obvious. The mansions swing alarmingly when the wind is up and it is not unknown for them to break free and plunge into the lake. Inside, the furniture and ornamentation is bolted down and visitors to the Fathomsound's barons have to find their sea legs quickly.

**The Traditions of Serfdom**

Sepheris Secundus's centuries of serfdom have created many traditions that confirm the relationship between baron and serf, some of which seem very strange to outsiders. The details of these traditions differ across the planet but their spirit is preserved everywhere. They include: Marriage. A marriage between serfs must be sanctioned by both serfs' barons. The prospective husband and wife each cut off a finger and send it to their baron, which symbolises the serfs handing over of their rights of any children born out of wedlock. Death. To demonstrate the fact that no serf ever fully pays off his debt to his baron, his body becomes his baron's property upon his death. Most barons dispose of these bounties by burying them under heaps of mine spoil, but some more ostentatious barons make a point of feeding dead serfs to their hounds. *Mandatory Celebrations* On an occasion important to the baron, such as the birth of a child, the baron's serfs are required to celebrate by breaking into dance upon hearing the news and whenever the baron approaches. Many barons take this very seriously and will flog nearby serfs until they begin to dance, regardless of whether they have heard the baron's good news or not. Faceday. A serf celebrates the day when he becomes old enough to stake his own claim on the Face (normally in early adolescence). The first Faceday is marked with three days of ceaseless toil, to demonstrate that the young serf indeed deserves the bounty of the Face. Anniversaries of this Faceday are marked with ceremonies that vary wildly but are always painful or humiliating, varying from simple beatings to being painted with offensive slogans and forced to run naked through the Commons. Day of Thanks. An annual holiday observed across Sepheris Secundus, the Day of Thanks is a chance for the serfs to remember and mourn their dead (a practice otherwise frowned upon or even prohibited). Since mourning is considered a selfish act, participants ritually disguise their identities by wearing masks, painting their faces or attending gatherings in pitch darkness.

# **THE MISERICORD**

The *Misericord* is an example of the many Chartist spacecraft that ply the trade routes between Scintilla, Iocanthos and Sepheris Secundus and the other worlds of the sector. It is an ugly and enormous ship, resembling a barnacle-encrusted, spacefaring whale, from which jut haphazard clusters of engines and towers, and it trails a long tail of debris like a comet. The *Misericord* carries huge quantities of trade goods between the client worlds, along with many passengers. Buying passage on a ship like the *Misericord* is the most common method of travelling between planets. Its round trip—Scintilla/Iocanthus/Sepheris Secundus—a route laid down on the charter carried by its captains, takes well over a year. Ships like the *Misericord* are very common in the Calixis Sector and throughout the Imperium, plying a slow, thankless route across the stars. Without the Chartist ships, large swathes of the Imperium would be completely cut off and sector economies would fail. In spite of this, few have much regard for the Chartist ships, and their crews are stereotyped as rough, untrustworthy void born with few scruples and even fewer refinements. Each Chartist craft needs a charter that sets out its permitted trade routes and activities, and the *Misericord's* charter was signed by one of the earliest generation of sector commanders.

The *Misericord* is considered an ill-omen at any place it docks. There are many Chartist craft in the Calixis Sector but for some reason the *Misericord* has an especially evil reputation.

It is considered very bad luck to marry, give birth or embark on a major venture while the *Misericord* is docked in system, and during the ship's many centuries of operation, tales have grown up about the dark things that occur while it is in port, such as plagues, tech-failures and the random disappearance of children. In addition, the crew are mostly void born, people who were born in space and rarely set foot on a planet, and the void born, as everyone knows, just aren't right in the head.

Inside, the *Misericord* resembles a huge, complex and grotesquely ornate castle. Many different ships make up the *Misericord* and they each have their own style, which in turn has been embellished and replaced over the centuries. In places where the component ships connect, corridors can become precipitous shafts, rooms can be upside-down and moving from place to place can be very complex, although the void born crew are adept at clambering up makeshift ladders or even leaping pits in the floor. The *Misericord's* interior is archaic, with feasting halls, dungeons, cobwebbed processional galleries and many other places that seem to have little connection to the business of the ship or the needs of the crew.

# **Ship Society**

Life on the *Misericord* is defined by the castes into which the crew are divided. There are dozens of castes, each one responsible for a particular function aboard ship. Crewmen are either born into these castes or assigned to them on the few occasions they join from outside. These castes range from the Scourhand Brotherhood (who scrub the filth from the floors of the engine decks) to the Company of Imbeciles (the ship's entertainers, consisting of various clowns, actors and storytellers). The officers of the *Misericord* form their own caste and wear distinctive and rather sinister masks to mark them out from the rest of the crew. Each caste has its own leadership, which reports to the officer caste, and the officers in turn receive their orders from the twin captains Anapollo and Luneros. The captains believe that the caste system is the reason the *Misericord* has survived for so long and are quick to bring anyone opposing it to trial. Castes are insular and proud, and sometimes they can come into bitter conflict, such as the regular skirmishes between the Lamplighters' Guild and the Followers of the Wire over who gets to change the glowbulbs. All have their own baffling traditions, from the large wood and paper animal masks of the Obeyers' Guild (the ship's lawyers and executioners) to the ritual removal of an ear from every member of the Enginists (who maintain the ship's temperamental engines). This latter ritual is said to be born of respect for a mythological Enginist of ages past, the heroic Bessimer "One-lug" Jone, who supposedly saved the *Misericord* from "dire disassemblage and ventation".

Most crew are true void born and live their whole life on the ship. However, since the castes are not permitted to interbreed, the ship needs new crew members from outside to replenish the gene pool. Some older legends remember the terrible "Age of Six Toes" when a mad previous captain refused to allow new blood onto the *Misericord*. Crew who join from outside—referred to as "clayfeet" are both blessed and cursed. They are valuable to the crew and are given the least dangerous duties, but on the other hand they can never be regarded as true members of the *Misericord*'s crew, and are treated as outsiders no matter how long they serve on the ship.

The Misericord's Castes

The castes into which the Misericord's crew are organised are insular, specialised and hereditary. It is impossible to change castes and most crew are born into them. Old castes can be dissolved and new ones founded by the order of the captain, but some of the Misericord's castes are as old as the ship itself. The ship's castes include the following: The Lords, Siblings and Officers is the full name of the officer caste. Members go everywhere masked, and assist the captains in making and enforcing decisions. The Merciful form the ship's security wing, armored in archaic plate and mail, and carrying ominous shotguns. They can change from impeccable politeness to extreme aggression instantly, even during the course of a mundane conversation. The Suturers' Parliament is the Misericord's body of medical personnel. The Suturers practise their procedures on the ship's small complement of live animals, so cats, pygmy Grox and other creatures wander around their sick bays and surgeries. The Immortals recover the bodies of dead crewmen, conduct void burials and investigate suspicious deaths. They enjoy reminding other crewmen of the fact that one day, they too will require the ministrations of the Immortals. The Communion of Ratters is dedicated to tackling the Misericord's constant vermin problem. There are only a few crewmen among the Ratters, with the rest of the being made up of old, patched-up ratting servitors. The Renders are the Misericord's cooks and they are also responsible for raising livestock raised on the ship for food. The caste's members take great pride in their food and are extremely vocal and sometimes violent in proclaiming the superiority of their personal recipes. No one argues like a Render.

The Bringers of Silence are the only caste not to have a generally known purpose. They answer to the twin captains and are occasionally seen walking purposefully through the ship in midnight blue uniforms, their faces painted with stars.

# **LOCATIONS OF NOTE**

The bridge of the *Misericord* is located close to the centre of the ship, in one of its very oldest parts, where the walls are covered in layers of faded frescoes depicting scenes from longforgotten myths and tragedies in the vessel's history. The captains and the bridge officers command the *Misericord* from a raised area, known as the captain's floor, which is flanked by a series of ornate and ancient flags which are changed to match the work shifts. Gilded war banners attend the day shift whilst silvered mercantile pennants are displayed at night. No one can remember the origination of this curiously theatrical practice, though it may be down to the whim of the twin captains. Bridge uniforms and staff are changed from gold (day) to silver (night) as the bridge hands over from one "ban" (ship jargon for a work shift) to another. Subsidiary helms, manned by officers who monitor the ship's systems, plot courses, man the ship's vox-casters and so on, stand to the side of the captain's floor. By ancient tradition, these lesser officers may not take the floor, unless specifically invited. To do so is to rise above one's station, an unforgivable and treasonous act against the strict hierarchy of command. Traitorous helmsmen have been thrown into the vastness of space for such a deed.

The twins require an audience on the bridge at all times and lots are drawn to determine which crew members must spend a day in an area known as the watch court. From here the watchmen are supposed to observe procedures on the bridge to ensure protocol. In reality, crew members treat their days on the court benches as if it were a theatrical performance. Most spend their time eating, commenting raffishly on various officers or staring in wonder at the captains. It is a point of strict protocol that officers on the bridge studiously ignore any comments, noisy chewing, thrown food or jeering from the court. In reality, crew who behave poorly often find that they suffer the consequences once they return to their normal work.

 Key ceremonial decisions, like a course change, are considered especially interesting by members of the crew, and those lucky enough to have their number drawn on a day when such an event is to occur will often sell their ticket to the highest bidder. Attending court on a false ticket is technically an offence against regulation, but in practice most officers turn a blind eye to the custom. Visitors to, and passengers aboard, the *Misericord* are often delighted by the arcane pageantry of bridge activity, which they are free to observe from an outer circle of seating beyond the watch court. This captive, intrigued audience may, of course, be why the captains have allowed this curious behaviour to develop.

Passengers on the *Misericord* stay in the Beyonder's Hostelry, a sprawl of small but well-appointed rooms kept by the Minions of Stewardship. The Minions have a number of quirks including being forbidden to speak, so they communicate through written notes (illiterate passengers tend to have difficulty on the *Misericord*) and with rapid sign language among themselves. The Minions decorate the Hostelry with the hundreds of shiny or brightly coloured things they find, many of which are left behind by previous passengers. The Hostelry is cramped and rather dusty, and while they are obliging, the Minions have a habit of getting things slightly wrong—most notably the food they bring to passengers always tastes bizarre. It is possible that the Minions deliberately misinterpret requests to make sure that passengers understand they are not a proper part of the *Misericord's* world.

The Gallery of Sin is one of the few places where the crewmen of the various castes mix. The Gallery is a wide, high-ceilinged deck with a small bustling town built inside it. Several of the castes, such as the Guardians Mercantile and the Coinwrackers, sell goods and services to crew and passengers. The Gallery of Sin (the name is of uncertain origin) is the closest thing to a "normal" community on the *Misericord,* but strange rituals and traditions still abound shopkeepers regularly hold mock battles in the streets, engage in elaborate and foul-mouthed haggling rituals with customers, and make sham sacrifices to vegetables. It is in the Gallery of Sin that the Company of Imbeciles performs in small street corner theatres. Some of these entertainers roam around singling out passers-by (preferably bemused passengers) to follow them performing mimes or poetry. The ethos of the Gallery seems to be that because it fulfils a fairly mundane purpose, its normality must be balanced by oddness and symbolism as much as possible.

# **POWER GROUPS**

S Several groups in the Calixis Sector hold power that is not restricted to one planet, but can be felt across the whole sector. These include the adepta of the Imperium, as well as the five Great Houses, which are as old as the Calixis Sector itself. Members of these groups can turn up on any of the sector's worlds, and they all possess enough resources to make themselves major players in the sector's complex tapestry of power.

# **THE ADEPTUS TERRA**

The Adeptus Terra is nominally the most important group in the Calixis Sector. As the "government" of the Imperium, the Adeptus Terra's members are responsible for ensuring that the Calixis Sector fulfils its obligations to the Imperium: offering up the correct tithes of materials, manpower and psykers, obeying Imperial laws and never harboring the Emperor's foes. Lord Sector Marius Hax is the sector governor and he appoints the subsector commanders who oversee the various areas of the Calixis Sector in Terra's name. Commander Hax himself answers to the commanders of the Segmentum Obscurus. Through this connection, Hax can request military aid from the Imperial Guard or Navy, or even the mighty Space Marines. However, unless he has strong evidence that the Calixis Sector is in immediate peril, his requests will not be answered. On a smaller scale, Commander Hax could have considerable sway over many of the sector's Adepts, such as members of the Adeptus Arbites or the Ecclesiarchy. Though Hax rules in a "hands-off " manner, this influence is not to be underestimated.

# **THE ADEPTUS MINISTORUM**

The Ministorum is a powerful force in the Calixis Sector. The area is sacred to Saint Drusus and is a destination for pilgrims from many sectors around, with many of its most notable places being religious in nature. Cardinal Ignato is energetic in keeping up the numbers of preachers and confessors active in the sector and these promulgators of the Imperial word are the most common adepts by far on most of the sector's worlds. Many planets have their own cardinal and these form the Sector Synod, headed by Ignato, which rules on spiritual matters affecting the Calixis Sector. Pious, Emperor-fearing citizens abound and pronouncements by Ignato or the Synod can be disseminated by the clergy and reach the ears of the average citizen far more effectively than through any other means.

The majority of citizens perform some act of worship regularly, from trudging along to a dingy temple once a month to nightly prayers in a noble's private chapel. Most permanent places of worship are home to a member of the Ecclesiarchy, which means that the Ecclesiarchy's adepts are numerous and strongly connected to the population in a way that no other adepts are. On worlds where adepts are lacking (such as Sepheris Secundus) much of the day-to-day preaching is done by lay clergy, pious individuals trained and deployed by Ecclesiarchy adepts to spread the word in places where even a devoted preacher baulks to tread. While there are few places in the Calixis Sector where the Emperor's word is not preached, the scattered nature of the adepts and the use of lay clergy mean that strict dogma is not always observed. Sometimes the teaching of the Imperial Creed can drift away from the Ecclesiarchical line. On Sepheris Secundus, for example, the barons and the queen are sometimes portrayed as sacred beings imbued with the Emperor's power by lay preachers who grew up in the planet's feudal system. On Iocanthos, mercenaries pay fealty to the Emperor as paymaster, while in Scintilla's underhives, countless versions of the Emperor are worshipped, from a fearsome god of destruction appeased with murder to the spirit of the hives themselves. While the Imperial creed reaches everywhere in the Calixis Sector, in truth Ignato and the other cardinals of the Sector Synod often have to strive hard to maintain orthodoxy there.

# **THE ADEPTUS ARBITES**

The role of the arbitrators is to ensure that the Calixis Sector's worlds obey Imperial law. Most worlds have an Adeptus Arbites presence and the arbitrators tend to be based in grim, precinct-fortresses to remind the population of the unyielding nature of Imperial law and to insure that there will always be a defendable location for the Arbites to hold in case of widespread rebellion. In the Calixis Sector few worlds aside from Scintilla have a major arbitrator presence, and most worlds only have a single precinct-fortress along with a few regional stations. In spite of this, the arbitrators are a feared force because they are loyal to nothing save Imperial law. Even a planetary governor can be arrested by the Adeptus Arbites should he harbor the Emperor's enemies or seek to throw off the yoke of Imperial authority. While they are a formidable presence with great authority, the arbitrators can only act to defend Imperial law and have little influence beyond this.

Lord Marshal Goreman is the most senior arbitrator in the Calixis Sector. Goreman began his long career as an enforcer, and his lack of sympathy for the desperate mass of Imperial citizens borders on disdain. He sees no greater crime than that of an Imperial citizen abandoning his duties to take up arms against a rightful authority, and he is known to personally lead riot suppression forces on Scintilla. The lord marshal demands regular reports from arbitrators on the sector's other planets, and is pessimistic in character, constantly issuing dire warnings about the Calixis Sector careering down a slippery slope towards lawlessness and terror. Goreman sees doom and anarchy in everything, including the activities of Scintilla's Magistratum. As far as he is concerned, the Magistratum are part of the problem and he actively despises them.

Goreman has recently permitted the development of the Divisio Immoralis, a small taskforce of arbitrators whose purpose is to collect intelligence on cult activities across the Calixis Sector and explain a recent rise in unrest and acts of terrorism by fringe cults. The Divisio Immoralis numbers only a few arbitrators led by the veteran, and rather burnedout, Senior Arbitrator Kae Drusil, but they have considerable leeway for their investigations and may turn up anywhere in the sector.

House Krin The Redemp tion On Scintilla, the Adeptus Arbites is based at the Fortress of the Just, a massive rockcrete slab that sits in the relentless desert a short flight away from Hive Tarsus. It is here that Goreman's headquarters can be found, along with the training facilities for the arbitrator cadets sent to the Calixis Sector, and the Sector Judicial archive. The Divisio Immoralis is based in a cramped set of offices in the Archive, while Scintilla's large pool of enforcers trains regularly in the bulletscarred mock town just outside the fortress. On Sepheris Secundus, the arbitrators are based at the Isolatorium and are mainly concerned with battling cults and mutant groups among the massive serf populations of the planet's mines. On Iocanthos, the Adeptus Arbites' presence is limited to a single squad of enforcers and an arbitrators stationed at Port Suffering, although they are almost always to be found out in the Wasteland following up some new allegation of cultists or rogue psykers.

# **THE REDEMPTION**

The Adeptus Ministorum's preachers are in short supply in the very deepest, darkest parts of the Calixis Sector's cities. Instead, another religious force brings the fiery word of the Emperor to these forsaken places, one that operates well beyond the reach of the Adepta: the Redemption. Many consider the Redemptionists to be the true terror of the underhives, rather than the bandits, mutants or criminals. Violent zealots who see sin everywhere, the tactics of the Redemptionists are simple: they roam the underhive putting sinners to the flame, holding impromptu stake-burnings, exhorting the fearful underhivers to give up their friends and relatives to the purifying fire, and preaching impassioned sermons about the intolerance of the Emperor and the wickedness of anyone who does not agree with the Redemption's point of view. The Redemption's masked foot soldiers are clad in red robes and are armed with anything that burns, from lit torches to flamers. The most blessed among them carry the eviscerator, a massive two-handed chainsaw, with which to mortify the flesh of sinners. Many Redemptionists are broken-minded souls who have lost everything to the violence of the underhive, and seek solace and vengeance in the religious hatred promised by the cult.

The Cult of the Redemption is strong in many areas of the Imperium and was probably brought to the Calixis Sector by zealots making a pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Illumination. It is active on several planets, but its spiritual home is Scintilla. The cult is organised into many Crusades, each led by a charismatic deacon. Though the Crusades operate independently, they all recognise the authority of one woman, the Archdeacon Ludmilla.

# **HOUSE KRIN**

House Krin are "Drusus's Bankers", a very old and close-knit family whose immense fortune stems from offering banking and loans to the other noble houses. They are possibly the oldest of the Great Houses still to have a sector-wide presence and are sharp in their criticism of the "new money" that has so much power in the modern sector. There are houses on almost every planet that rely on House Krin to help maintain their own finances. The conspicuous expenditure of Hive Sibellus, for example, would be impossible without House Krin loans, and the DeVayne Incorporation could not purchase the rights to generations of Sepheris Secundus's serfs without House Krin advancing them the funds to do so. House Krin keeps itself to itself but its estates can be found on a great many worlds. They are not as lavish as those of other houses, as their position is secure enough for them not to rely on such vulgarity to ensure their position. House Krin has a sizeable body of

Archdeacon Ludmilla

Ludmilla is a sturdily built, middle-aged woman who is the self-styled leader of the Redemption in the Calixis Sector Emperor is vengeful in the extreme and that it is her duty as a human. She believes that the being to punish every sin, from impure thoughts to excessive cursing, with excessive amounts of fire. Ludmilla believes in purifying fire as strongly as she believes in the Emperor, and loves to see sinners whole sections of the underhive consumed in flame, places of ill repute and Ludmilla is devoted and not a little crazed.

 preacher and a competent fighter. She is an impassioned hellfire, although she wields her sacred weapon, a pair of massive industrial shears, with more enthusiasm than skill. Ludmilla's true skill is in encouraging her faithful to let the Emperor's fury consume them, until there is nothing left of themselves: no compassion, not even any memory, just the burning hatred of the Emperor for all sinners have the Redemption accepted as a part of the Imperial Creed. Her grandest project is to, and she sends tributes to Cardinal Ignato in the hope that he will declare the Redemptionists to be valued members of the Adeptus Ministorum of cartloads of charred sinners left outside the Cathedral of Illumination. These tributes mostly consist. So far, Ignato has not responded.

The Great Houses

The term "Great House", or "Sector House", refers to those civilian organisations that have a presence across the Calixis Sector. This sets them apart from "planetary" or "lesser" houses, which might wield enormous power on a particular planet but do not have any particular influence elsewhere. In the earliest days of the Calixis Sector, all the Great Houses, and most of the planetary houses, were based around noble families. The old Great Houses were enormous extended familial lines, with strict rules of heredity to maintain their monopoly on power. In the current days, several of the Great Houses are actually corporations. They may act as if they were noble families but the truly hereditary Great Houses are quick to point out that their memberships are based on ambition and skill, rather than bloodline. The Great Houses play their own game of politics and wealth, and with their thousands of members and troops, they have the potential to exercise enormous power in the Calixis Sector. Some dominate whole worlds and some harbor ambitions that will one day pit them against the Adepta of the Imperium.

Many nobles are certain that House Krin must have a vault somewhere filled with unimaginable wealth, and even suggest that the house's senior members view this accumulation of gold with religious awe, but if any of this is true, the location of the House Krin vaults is a closely guarded secret. Similarly House Krin's most important members rarely deal with anyone outside the house, preferring to have lesser members deal with "outsiders" (a fact that does little to endear them to nobles from other houses).

# **THE CESTELLE ALLIANCE**

The origins of the Cestelle Alliance lie on the world of Regulus in the Hazeroth Abyss. Regulus was an agri-world run by the Administratum but when their adepts were all killed by a meteor impact, the small feudal kingdoms took over the management of their world. By the time contactwith the Imperium was re-established, it was clear that the alliance of indigenous peoples was running the agri-world more efficiently than the Administratum, and the natives of Regulus were left to their own devices as long as their tithe of food was met. From this string of events was born the Cestelle Alliance, the unified people of Regulus, who sent members to other, less promising worlds and transformed them over the following decades into fertile agri-worlds in their own rights, passing on enormous tithes to Sector Governor Hax's government. Slowly, almost without the other Great Houses knowing, the Cestelle Alliance amassed the wealth and power to make them the equal of the other sector houses.

The Cestelle Alliance now controls many agri-worlds in the Calixis Sector. It has not escaped the notice of Lord Sector Hax that the Alliance, if it wished, could cut off food supplies to the sector's most populated worlds and create a crisis of famine to hold the sector to ransom. To keep the Alliance firmly on the Imperial side, Hax has appointed Egoyan Cestelle as the governor of the Adrantis Nebula and continues to permit the Alliance rights to its agri-worlds. The members of the Alliance must walk a curious tightrope between maintaining the traditions of their home worlds and kingdoms, and acting like fully recognised nobles of the Calixis Sector. The traditions of Regulus include facial tattooing (with the higherranking nobles sporting extraordinarily intricate scrollwork), incinerating the house's dead on funeral pyres and praying to the Emperor in the raucous manner first taught to the people of Regulus by Imperial missionaries.

The Alliance participates in the sector's games of politics and etiquette, even though it is considered little more than a gang of primitive yokels by most other nobles, but they are very reluctant to allow any interference on the planets they control, even resisting visits by adepts to their agri-worlds. Those few who have gone to a Cestelle Alliance world have sometimes reported wide-eyed tales of abased rituals around giant burning effigies. The Alliance goes to great lengths to show a sophisticated, aristocratic face to the Calixis Sector but some say they are unable to completely hide their primitive side. The colours of the Cestelle Alliance are red and golden yellow, and their emblem is a sea of crops, gently bending in the wind.

# **THE DEVAYNE INCORPORATION**

The DeVayne Incorporation is an unusual sector house that was originally a large and powerful religious order. The Sepulchral Brotherhood was a movement of the Imperial Creed that trained laymen in religious matters. Specifically, it sent out emissaries to the most downtrodden masses, to preach to them how they were blessed to have the opportunity to give their lives in service to their Emperor and how they should be grateful for the decades of backbreaking labour that made up their future. The Brotherhood grew in popularity and was originally a valued part of the Adeptus Ministorum, but a distance grew between the Ministorum and the Brotherhood's army of lay preachers who had become the only religious authority in many areas. Several centuries ago, following a declaration by the Synod Calixis, the Ministorum withdrew its adepts and demanded that the Brotherhood cease preaching. The Brotherhood abandoned its religious functions in the wake of the "Sepulchral Schism" but it did not disappear. Instead, it took advantage of the hold it had over the labourers of many worlds and its lay preachers became instead members of the newly founded DeVayne Incorporation.

The DeVayne Incorporation bases its wealth and influence on the labour of those same hordes of menial workers (referred to by the Incorporation as "thralls"). It owns the rights to millions of lives in places such as the lower forges of Gunmetal City. The Incorporation is the single biggest purchaser of serf rights from the crown of Sepheris Secundus outside the local barons and on dozens of other worlds, the labour of DeVayne's thralls allows the Incorporation to amass wealth and influence. If another Great House needs raw materials, they often come from mines, fields or refineries managed by DeVayne thralls. The Incorporation is famous for the small army of clerks it employs to keep the records of its thralls. It is said that every single thrall is named in DeVayne's records and that the Incorporation has contracts with mercenaries and bounty hunters whose job is to bring back runaway thralls. DeVayne's household troops, veterans of serf uprisings on Sepheris Secundus, are famously brutal when they lend their strength to putting down rebellions and protests in which thralls are involved.

Though the Sepulchral Brotherhood has been officially dead for centuries, the DeVayne Incorporation's members have a strong air of religiosity about them. It recruits new members from among the children of its thralls, a practice unique among the Great Houses and one which elicits great suspicion amongst noble families who do not understand how base peasants can rise to become members of a Great House. The Incorporation's members consider the thralls to have no value except in financial terms, which mystifies observers considering most of them were once thralls themselves. Cynics insist that the Incorporation must still have some religious purpose at its heart to command such devotion from the same people whose lives it made a misery.

Certainly DeVayne's organisation, with its members divided into "orders" each responsible for an area of house business, resembles that of a religious body, and its members can be evangelical about the Incorporation's mission to help the people of the Imperium fulfil their duties to the Emperor and their fellow man. These impassioned outbursts are excellent for convincing thralls that they are working for the good of the Imperium but are less welcome among sector nobility. The low-born nature of the Incorporation's members means that they are treated like pariahs by most noble houses, but none can deny that the DeVayne Incorporation is one of the driving forces behind the economy of the Calixis Sector. The Adeptus Ministorum harbors a deep mistrust of the DeVayne Incorporation and many of its adepts believe that the Sepulchral Brotherhood is alive and thriving among the Incorporation's leadership, intent on spreading some form of religious corruption. The Incorporation's colours are dove grey and its symbol is an open hand.

# **THE MACHENKO DYNASTY**

The Machenko Dynasty, an extended family organised along strictly hereditary lines in the manner of the old houses, is the most mysterious of the Great Houses. Seventy-five years ago the dynasty's patriarch, Lord Scelestes Machenko, was accused of witchcraft, heresy and impiety, and

burned at the stake. The dynasty fell with him, its estates invaded by rival families and its wealth confiscated by the Administratum. The dynasty spent the following decades rebuilding itself, and its members have kept its record scrupulously clean since the Machenkan Purge. Although a dark shadow hangs over the dynasty because of its past, no one has ever been able to find evidence of impiety during the dynasty's return to power. The source of the dynasty's wealth, with which it funded its return to Great House status and currently plays the great games of noble politics, is a complete mystery and the source of the darkest of rumours. Certainly the dynasty owns a great deal, from hive spire estates to tracts of land, but it does not seem to control any agri-worlds or factoria with which to make the money it so clearly has. When questioned about the source of the dynasty's capital, Machenkan nobles reply (with impeccable politeness) that they keep their own counsel about such matters.

The members of the Machenko Dynasty have turned etiquette into an art form and house scholars compile great volumes of etiquette, which Machenkan nobles carry around with them by means of a lectern-servitor. So complex are the dynasty's ritualised greetings and forms of address that nobles from rival houses often claim they are some kind of secret code. In any case, the Machenkan nobles dismiss the great mysteries of their house with charm and politeness, and without exception make for gracious guests and accommodating hosts. As dark as the rumours about them may be, few nobles turn down an invitation from the dynasty. The Machenko Dynasty's symbol is a ringed planet and its house colours are a deep blue.

# **THE SKAELEN-HAR HEGEMONY**

Skaelen-Har is a massive corporation founded on a set of comprehensive philosophical principles known as the Concordium. The Skaelen-Har Hegemony is a very powerful and efficient heavy manufacturing corporation with concerns across the

Calixis Sector, including hundreds of factoria in Hive Sibellus and Gunmetal City. One of its major products is spaceship parts and the Battlefleet Calixis in particular relies on Skaelen-Har to keep its warships in space. The connection between the Imperial Navy and the Hegemony is strong, since without the Hegemony the Battlefleet Calixis would be completely grounded.

Every member of the Hegemony follows the Concordium, a set of strictures that emphasise the realisation of an individual's potential through the destruction of his personality. The Concordium describes an "ideal" personality as obedient but ambitious, amoral and unmoved by emotive arguments, decisive and unforgiving. People who display these traits, claim Skaelen-Har, are those most likely to succeed in the 41st Millennium. A member of Skaelen-Har is required to gradually put aside his own personality in favour of the Concordium. His original personality is only permitted to emerge in controlled environments at Skaelen-Har gatherings. Members of Skaelen-Har are recruited from all strata of society, as long as they have the potential to accept the Concordium. They then advance up the strict Hegemony hierarchy, with the higher circles being composed of those who have abandoned their personality completely. These higher circles form the leadership of Skaelen-Har and with their Concordium so in control there is little dissent or indecisiveness displayed in the Hegemony's activities. Skaelen-Har members make for excellent Naval officers and there are many in the Battlefleet Calixis, but many in the officer class are suspicious of the Hegemony's motives in placing so many of its members on the sector's warships.

Members of Skaelen-Har are all required to give up a part of themselves to the Concordium. To symbolise this, they all have a body part replaced, usually a hand or facial feature. The replacements range from simple prosthetics for lower-circle members to state-of-theart augmentations for the most devoted followers of the Concordium. Skaelen-Har's members wear the hegemony's colours of black and silver and bear the symbol of a silver starburst.

# **THE CALIXIAN CONCLAVE**

The branch of the Inquisition that watches the Calixis Sector is known as the Calixian Conclave. Overseen by Lord Inquisitor Caidin, its High Council and Officio are based in the Tricorn Palace on Scintilla. It has many sub-officios and a grim fortified outpost can be found on or near most major or highly populated planets. Sub-officio administrators are known by the rank Planetia Inquisitor and control local conclavium councils that resemble the High Council in miniature. The Calixian Conclave has troops, spacecraft and acolytes at its disposal, but its most valuable commodity is its Inquisitors themselves, who possess skills and authority beyond the imaginings of most Imperial citizens. The Calixian Conclave watches over the whole sector and there is no limit to its jurisdiction.

It should be noted that, despite the governing hand of Caidin and the High Council, the Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave are not all of the same mind. They are independent souls, set on individual missions and enterprises. Each one has very strong ideas about the way the Inquisition should conduct itself and the length to which they must go to preserve the Imperium. Some become outright enemies and no two have exactly the same agenda. Should they ever pull together they would form by far the greatest power block in the area, eclipsing even the great noble families in the resources they can muster. Until that happens, the Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave are their own worst enemies, scheming against one another or pursuing their goals in secret, using their acolytes as playing pieces in games of superiority. Some of the Calixian Inquisitors are noble and pious, exemplars of Imperial values, others are more free-thinking or, as a Puritan would put it, corrupt. Any one of them could be the Calixis Sector's greatest saviour or its most notorious villain. Caidin and the High Council do their best to keep the scattered Inquisitors moving with a unified purpose, but sometimes they have to arbitrate disputes.

# **THE TYRANTINE CABAL**

The Tyrantine Cabal was commissioned many years ago in response to the dread prophesy of the Tyrant Star. Its members are known as Tyrantites or Spectarians (or more dismissively as star gazers), for they are charged with investigating apparitions of the spectral sun and the influence of the baleful Tyrant Star. The Tyrantine Cabal is based at the Bastion Serpentis, a bleak fortress of age-polished black stone jutting from the surface of Scintilla's moon Lachesis. The Bastion is typical of the Inquisition waystations and local fortresses peppered across the sector. The Spectarians were granted sole discretionary use of the Bastion Serpentis at the inception of their cabal. Lord Sector Hax, Chief Astropath Xiao and a few others know of its existence, and those who do not are kept away from the moon by dire warnings about geological instability. Lord Inquisitor Zerbe can normally be found at the Bastion and it is here in its grand audience chamber that he holds the semi-regular meetings with all the cabal's Inquisitors, at which they report on their activities and share information. These gatherings are as much a venue for making allies and enemies as they are a forum for exchanging intelligence on the sector's various threats and power groups.

As the threat of the Tyrant Star is felt across the Calixis Sector, the membership of the cabal is not formally fixed. Some Inquisitors, those listed here, have stayed in the Calixis Sector for some time and accept Zerbe's authority (although they do not all obey him by any means). Other Inquisitors might join on a temporary basis, especially if an investigation elsewhere brings them to the Calixis Sector in matters intersecting the Hereticus Tenebrae, while some simply come to lend their support while they tap the expertise of the cabal's most experienced Inquisitors. The individuals listed here are confirmed Spectarians, but Inquisitors join and leave all the time, with Zerbe's blessing.

# **Star KOMUS, THE TYRANT STAR**

**The so-called Tyrant Star resists easy interpretation but certain key facts are evident.**

K Komus is described in a doom-laden vision which speaks in apocalyptic terms of a "darkness" that will engulf the worlds of man and ultimately devour human civilisation. The engulfing darkness will be preceded by signs and portents, so-called herald events, that will gradually transmute human minds and make them ready to embrace the darkness. Many believe this to be an obvious allusion to a rising of Chaos and the warp, though this explanation is far from universally agreed. There are many considerable threats in the galaxy. The prophecy could as much apply to the Tyranids (scholars note a repeated use of the word "devour" in the prophecy text) or the Eldar as to the warp. However, given the warp's manifest ability to uncreate and mutate reality, much weight is given to this idea by the Tyrantian Conclave. The actual text of the prophecy is secured in the archives of the Bastion Serpentis, and Zerbe only allows a very favoured few to examine the complete transcript.

In speaking of the herald events, the Propheticum Hereticus Tenebrae, as the manuscript is called, makes many references to "Komus" or the "Tyrant Star". Komus is said to be the harbinger, a portent of the encroaching darkness. It is said to be a "black sun" or a "halo of black flame". This preternatural harbinger is represented by an unholy rune, best described as a clawed bird's foot. The rune has resisted specific translation and no previous occurrence of it has yet been found.

Zerbe believes it can be no coincidence that the Calixis Sector is fraught with a curious, recurring phenomena: that of the "Spectral Sun". From time to time—no specific interval period has been identified—a monstrous "black sun" matching the prophetic descriptions has mysteriously appeared in various locations throughout the sector.

No two appearances have been quite the same but the pattern of visitation is usually this: with little warning, a ghostly star apparently emitting black flames and esoteric, unknown radiations, spontaneously materialises in a planetary system, shines malevolently for a few days, and then, just as mysteriously, vanishes without trace. The visitation is accompanied by psychic disturbance, geological upheaval and sociological problems, including mass rioting and unrest.

Most often, the Spectral Sun actually eclipses a system's natural star, as if possessing it, causing consternation and panic on the orbiting worlds as their sun goes black.

However, the Spectral Sun has also on occasion appeared less directly—a strangely bright star at night, a phantom corona around a moon—before disappearing.

No astronomer has successfully explained the eerie phenomenon. It belies human science and has thus far evaded close investigation. Its visitations cannot be predicted. The Tyrantine Cabal believes that the Spectral Sun phenomenon is the Tyrant Star, Komus, as it so closely matches various descriptions in the prophecy. Some suggest the Tyrant Star is the ghost image of some stellar body in the immaterium, shining through the worn fabric of space. Others say it is a mirror image, a warp-space star that is partially translating into realspace, trying to find a way through. Yet others claim that the Tyrant Star is an artificial body, driven by xenos engines and mechanisms mankind cannot comprehend.

Whatever the truth, the phenomenon is a fact. It has manifested eighteen times in the Calixis Sector during the last century. Every single visitation has caused public unrest and geological instability. Where the Tyrant Star appears, earthquakes and volcanic upsurges follow. A world will experience a violent period of upset and revolution prior to its appearance. Many more psykers than usual will be born or become active. Mutation will occur. These things will usually take place in the two or three months leading up to a manifestation.

Signs and portents will be widespread: these generally are a matter of birthmarks, odd runic sigils appearing upon walls without explanation and the rise of fanatical cults. Some sources also describe premonitory halfsightings, fleeting glimpses of the black-flamed sun in mirrors, pools, puddles or even on the surface of wine or water in drinking vessels.

Mass panic and insanity precede a visitation of the Tyrant Star. No one has been able to explain how it appears and covers a system's natural star with its noxious black smoke. Sometimes, disorder and civil unrest lead to nothing and, for all the portents and cues, the Tyrant Star never actually appears, though this may be because it has manifested in a way that is hard to detect. On at least two recorded occasions, the Tyrant Star has appeared merely as a distant star above a world, no larger than a morning star, instead of eclipsing the local sun.

The Tyrantine Cabal believes it is a vital part of its work to trace and investigate these visitations, and to actually be on site to witness a manifestation. Zerbe hopes that important data may be gathered during a genuine sighting. In the sector at large, the visitations are a matter of myth and rumour. The Inquisition has carefully suppressed any official confirmation of the phenomenon.

# **INQUISITORS OF THE TYRANTINE CABAL** 

# **Lord Inquisitor Anton Zerbe, Ordo Hereticus**

Anton Zerbe is the commissioned leader of the Tyrantine Cabal, a position he was granted by Lord Inquisitor Caidin himself. He does not take his duties lightly, as he believes the black doctrine of the Tyrant Star to be very real indeed. He rarely leaves the Bastion Serpentis, and chairs the frequent meetings of the cabal's Inquisitors. Zerbe once roamed the Imperium seeking out corruption and incompetence amongst the Adepta but he is now dedicated to his role. Zerbe is never seen without his impassive golden mask and magnificent gilded armor, and he seems perfectly at home on the throne of the Bastion's audience chamber. He is not an easily approachable man and always remains distant from those around him.

Zerbe is even-handed to a fault, refusing in all cases to support one Inquisitor over another, no matter how grave an accusation might have been brought. His principal motivation is preventing strife within the Tyrantine Cabal, so that the group can do its holy work. He believes that if any one Inquisitorial faction within the cabal was to prevail, the sector—the Imperium itself even—would be doomed. If the Recongregators got what they wanted, the cabal would devolve into anarchy. If the Xanthites prevailed, Chaos would corrupt the work. Even the Amalathians, if they succeeded in their aims, would drag the cabal into a miserable malaise. Zerbe's objective is to prevent any one of these factions overcoming the others in the Calixis Sector, so that the Hereticus Tenebrae might be averted. Nothing else matters. He will even go as far as to recruit acolytes of his own to foil one of his Inquisitors' plans. In addition to his political skills, Zerbe is a powerful psyker, although this fact is not generally known within the cabal. Zerbe keeps his psychic talents in reserve should he be forced to vanquish a particularly dangerous foe personally.

# **Witch Finder Rykehuss, Ordo Hereticus**

Rykehuss is the terror of witches, a man for whom everyone is guilty of something and the only punishment is death. To him the Calixis Sector is a cesspit where witches breed like flies and the honest, pious Imperial citizens are besieged by sin on all sides. Rykehuss's bouts of volcanic anger and impassioned sermonising are well known at the Bastion Serpentis, and he constantly exhorts his fellow Inquisitors to descend on all the sinners to purify them with righteous flame or condemn them to damnation. Rykehuss wears ornate, heavily customized armor gifted to him by the Adeptus Mechanicus after he sought out a witch cult on a forge world in a nearby sector, and he is an expert with a veritable armory of weapons.

The witch finder's methods are simple. He descends on a particular city, sees depravity everywhere and immediately sets up a Court of Ordeals where pious citizens bring accused neighbours and family members to be tried. When Rykehuss hears of a particularly foul heresy being perpetrated somewhere nearby, he gathers all the torch-wielding backup he can and marches there, trusting in his martial skill to help him put the sinners to death personally. Some who witness Rykehuss's terrors consider him a hero, others a butcher, and both are right. Many innocents have died at Rykehuss's hands but so have many rogue psykers and cultists. Rykehuss, however, is not as crude a man as his methods would suggest. He knows that he cannot kill all the sinners, but his bombastic and terrifying style ensures that Imperial citizens are constantly reminded that there are threats in their midst and bigger threats waiting to punish them for their weaknesses. Innocent deaths, while regrettable, are a small price to pay for Rykehuss to spread the fear that helps suppress the activities of witches—and in any case, the Emperor sorts them all out in the end. Rykehuss is obsessed with the notion that it is the widespread activity of witches in the sector that is bringing on the doom of the Hereticus Tenebrae.

# **Daemonhunter Ahmazzi, Ordo Malleus**

Ahmazzi is the Spectarians' sole Ordo Malleus Inquisitor. He is a grizzled and ancient veteran, close on three hundred years old, whose career has taken him from Titan to the very edges of the Imperium, hunting down Daemons and the corrupt humans who summon them. Now all but decrepit, he has come to the Calixis Sector to, as he puts it, "bask in the radiance of the Tyrant Star and learn its secrets".

A long career has left Ahmazzi intensely cynical and pessimistic. He has come to believe that the Emperor is dead, Chaos cannot be stopped and the human race is doomed. The Imperium, Ahmazzi believes, is a grotesque symptom of the fact that the human race is currently living through its inevitable and drawn-out extinction. He has dabbled with Radicalism in his career, even being declared Excommunicate by Puritan colleagues for seeking out Daemonic knowledge but no one in the cabal other than Zerbe knows this. Ahmazzi has no friends and does not particularly care what people think of him, angrily refusing to tell any stories of his astonishing Daemonhunting career, although an acolyte who displays great courage in the face of a Daemonic foe might win Ahmazzi's grudging respect. Ahmazzi was a martially minded Inquisitor in his prime and secretly would love nothing better than to mount up on his mobile war pulpit, don his armor and take up his Daemonhammer to ride into battle once more against a horde of Daemonic foes. He believes that the Tyrant Star maybe the harbinger of man's inevitable doom and he wants to be at ground zero to witness the great day when it happens.

# **Inquisitor Astrid Skane, Ordo Hereticus**

A formidable woman, Inquisitor Skane exudes the rough authority of a seasoned arbitrator officer. Tough and resourceful, she is one of the most active of the cabal's Inquisitors, happy to get her hands dirty rooting out corruption. Skane is a striking woman with a stern, strong face who wears her hair regulation short. She habitually dresses much as she did when she served as an arbitrator on Scintilla, in a black uniform and body armor, and is rarely seen without her shock maul and shotgun. Skane respects those who respect her, treats her more skilled acolytes as equals and has little time for pomp and appearances.

Skane follows the Recongregators' creed, which states that the Imperium must be reformed radically to reduce the suffering of its people and that the Inquisition is the only body with the authority and skill to reform it. Skane believes that the Imperium's woes are caused by corruption among its ruling classes. She developed a particular hatred for corrupt nobles whilst serving as an arbitrator and has carried that through to her work as an Inquisitor. Her operations, therefore, target corruption among the nobility and the Adepta, including the Adeptus Arbites she once served. She dreams of a future where the Imperium is turned upside-down and justice is the rule rather than the exception, but she realises that she will not live to see it. She fights for what justice she can and hopes that others will follow her to carry on the battle. Skane is convinced that the Tyrant Star can only be appearing due to some form of summons. She believes there is a powerful cult at work in the sector, employing sorcery to call the Tyrant Star down on mankind. That is a cult she would very much like to personally root out.

**Inquisitor Van Vuygens, Ordo Xenos**

### Rarely seen at the Bastion Serpentis, Van Vuygens represents the Ordo Xenos in the conclave. He is a quietly spoken man who is more of a scholar than a warrior and, though he can certainly look after himself if required, he sees more value in dissecting and studying xenos than exterminating them. Slender, bespectacled and dressed in an archivist's robes, Van Vuygens does not cut as imposing a figure as some of the cabal's more dramatic characters, but he has the intellect and strength of will to delve into the mindset of the xenos and still retain his humanity. He leaves the human and Daemonic threats to the other Inquisitors, focusing instead on helping provide the Imperium with its chief weapon against the alien: an understanding of what the aliens want and what they will do to get it. Though Van Vuygens seeks knowledge about aliens, he does not trust them and would never fraternise with them. He has not studied a single alien species that does not pose some threat towards the human race.

A disciple of the legendary Inquisitor Kryptmann himself, Van Vuygens is in the Calixis Sector to watch for the signs of a Tyranid hive fleet invasion from beyond the edge of charted space. Kryptmann has theorised that the earlier Tyranid invasions of Imperial space have been testing the Imperium's defences and that the next invasion will come from an unexpected quarter. Van Vuygens has seen nothing that proves that a Tyranid invasion is impending but there are certainly plenty of other signs of alien influence among the worlds of the Calixis Sector, from ancient cyclopean ruins to disturbing similarities between the mythological cycles of primitive worlds. Van Vuygens is currently piecing together a picture of the alien civilisation that once inhabited the very edge of the Calixis Sector's space and he does not like what he sees. He, naturally, subscribes to the view that the Tyrant Star is a matter of xenos origin and has grave fears that it is linked with the dreaded Tyranids.

# **Inquisitor Globus Vaarak, Ordo Hereticus**

Severely wounded as an Interrogator while boarding a pirate ship, Vaarak's body is broken, scarred and bloated. Both his legs were amputated and he moves by means of a robust mechanical vehicle with mechanical legs and an inbuilt life-support system. His face is horribly burned and pockmarked, with tubes running from his nostrils and mouth to help him breathe. One arm was also lost and has been replaced with an obvious bionic limb. Vaarak's clothing is a ribbed black bodyglove that barely holds in his enormous girth and which incorporates cooling and regulating devices to keep him alive.

Vaarak is an Amalathian who believes that the Imperium, as grim a place as it is, must survive in its current state if the human race is to continue existing. He therefore seeks out sedition and rebellion in the Calixis Sector, trying to maintain the careful balance of its power groups. Given that he cannot operate in the guise of a normal citizen or adept, Vaarak must conduct most investigations through his acolytes, of whom he has several teams. His methods are subtle and moderate compared to some of the cabal's other Inquisitors, for he would prefer that the Inquisition's hand was not obvious, and encourages his acolytes to avoid open conflict and violence as much as possible. Vaarak has a bleak and self-deprecating sense of humour and is an excellent judge of character. Many of the conclave's next generation of Inquisitors will come from among Vaarak's Interrogators if he remains in favour. He has joined the Spectarians because the Tyrant Star represents a truly destabilising threat to Imperial society.

# **Lady Olianthe Rathbone**

Lady Olianthe claims membership of none of the three great Ordos. She originated among the Calixis Sector's nobility and still favours magnificent ballgowns and elaborate wigs, which would not look out of place in the ballroom of some governor's palace. Beneath the finery, her piercing, ice-cold grey eyes betray a keen and ruthless intelligence. Some say she was originally an Interrogator in the employ of Lord Inquisitor Zerbe but there is never any obvious familiarity shown between them. Lady Olianthe is very difficult to know and impossible to befriend, and manages to suggest that everyone around her is her inferior without actually stating it out loud.

Secretly a deep-seated Radical, Lady Olianthe is an Istvaanian and believes that for the Imperium to become stronger, it must be exposed to war and catastrophe. The Calixis Sector, to her way of thinking, is bloated and irredeemable, and desperately needs a major cataclysm to weed out its weak and corrupt citizens. While she is not averse to combating particularly horrible threats like Chaos cultists or the mutants she personally despises, Lady Olianthe is also constantly on the lookout for ways to manipulate the power structures of the Calixis Sector towards strife. She intends to do this by subtly coaxing the sector's leading noble houses towards conflict or rebellion. She is willing to pursue this agenda personally, treating her acolytes as little more than intelligence gatherers who have no idea of her destructive ambitions. The Tyrant Star would be a wonderful tool for her purposes.

# **Inquisitor Soldevan, Ordo Hereticus**

A handsome man with skin the colour of ebony and a taste in imposing military dress uniforms that only enhance his air of strength and authority. Soldevan was originally an Interrogator in the employ of Witch Finder Rykehuss but never believed in his master's extreme methods, and quickly broke with Rykehuss after attaining the Inquisitorial Seal. Soldevan believes that knowledge, not wanton destruction, is the key to protecting humanity from the threats it faces.

Soldevan's beliefs run deeper than he would ever admit. He believes that the warp is an immense source of power and that an Inquisitor is a man of sufficient intelligence and willpower to harness it. Soldevan wants to open up a pathway to the warp and seek out the consciousnesses that dwell there hoping to bargain with them for the power he needs to combat the enemies of mankind. Soldevan has got quite close to his goal and has several forbidden tomes in his possession that, with the right sacrifices and rituals, will summon forth powerful Daemons for him to negotiate with. He is always seeking more knowledge or artefacts of the warp, either captured during the cabal's operations or purchased at extortionate prices from unscrupulous dealers in forbidden relics. Somewhere during this process Soldevan has lost his sanity and replaced it with absolute conviction that the warp holds the secrets of humanity's survival. He believes that the Tyrant Star represents a vital conduit to secrets of the warp.

# **Inquisitor Vownus Kaede, Ordo Hereticus (Xenos)**

Inquisitor Vownus Kaede is a noted scholar, philosopher and an optimist. He is also a skilled swordsman, irreverent scoundrel and a self-righteous reprobate. Named after the rogue hero of Catuldynus's epic verse allegory "The Once-Pure Hive", Kaede has spent most of his life living up to his namesake's legacy. Originating somewhere, "East of Sol and West of Macragge", Kaede signed on with a free captain at a young age and has never looked back. The details of his elevation to Inquisitor status are hazy and change every time he tells the story. The only point that remains consistent is that he was once a member of the Ordo Xenos, before finding his true calling as a Witch Hunter. Regardless of his chequered past, Inquisitor Kaede has been a respected member of the cabal for over a decade.

Though he is nominally of Puritan leanings, Kaede is a skilled psyker who fanatically believes in the psychic future of the human race and is willing to casually commit almost any atrocity in order to safeguard it. He and the martially inclined acolyte bands he employs spend a great deal of time travelling between Calixis's subsectors chasing down rumours of hidden witches. Kaede absolutely detests Rykehuss's methods and takes a great deal of pleasure in spiriting promising young psykers out from under the Witch Finder's pogroms. Inquisitor Kaede appears exactly the way Imperium citizens picture a Witch Hunter. From his wide-brimmed hat, to his Inferno Pistol, to the ancient short-bladed force sword named "Slight Jest" that he bears at his side, there is no mistaking his appearance and what it implies, which is exactly what Kaede wishes. To Kaede, the Tyrant Star prophecy is a delicious

# mystery to be unlocked. **Inquisitor Al-Subaai, Ordo Xenos**

Recently elevated to Inquisitor status after serving as an Interrogator in the service of Inquisitor Van Vuygens. While Van Vuygens combs the very edge of Imperial space for alien civilisations, Al-Subaai's role is to search for alien influence in the populated worlds of the sector. Probably the youngest Inquisitor in the cabal, Al-Subaai is deeply pious, and he looks it, usually attending gatherings in a monastic habit worn over sturdy, practical carapace armor.

Al-Subaai believes that everything in the galaxy is connected and that the various alien species and their depredations are part of a larger web of hostility generated by the galaxy. The galaxy, Al-Subaai believes, is reacting to human occupation like a body reacting to a disease. To him, aliens (as well as all creatures of the warp) are symptoms of the galaxy's enmity towards mankind. Al-Subaai therefore advocates the destruction of all aliens, especially those who influence humans. He considers his remit to cover not only alien-influenced cults and corruption, but also the trafficking in alien creatures and their technology. Anyone dealing with aliens or their artefacts is an enemy of humanity and nothing gives Al-Subaai greater satisfaction than to hunt them down and subject them to whatever punishment the cabal decrees. To Al-Subaai, the Propheticum Hereticus Tenebrae is the handiwork of alien manipulation.

# **OTHER SECTOR WORLDS**

There are many worlds within the Calixis Sector. From the stretches of the Golgenna Reach to the dim coldness of the Hazeroth Abyss, there are many types of planet inhabited by man. Some, such as the Hives of Fenksworld, are well known to the Imperium, whilst others are all but lost, faded from Administratum maps or isolated by warp storms. All have the potential to harbor miscreants, heretics and other, darker forces. Unlike many folk in the 41st Millennium, acolytes may well find themselves ranging far and wide across the sector in the course of their duties.

# **41 PRY**

Pry is a gas giant, with a dingy Imperial station in orbit, designated 41 Pry. The station is a famous supply point and a seat of illegal activity. Ghostfire pollen is available here, at a price, if you know who to talk to. If you don't, such questions will get you killed rather swiftly.

# **88 TANSTAR**

A Navy depot on an outlying colony world (seventy eight million population).

# **ACREAGE**

A feudal world with sub-Imperial tech-levels, marked out across its continents in feudal demesnes ruled by despot warlords.

# **BARSAPINE**

Small Imperial hive world (population two billion) in the Adrantis Nebula. Primary exports: cogitation cells and pottery.

# **CLOISTER**

This inhospitable world is the site of a mendicant order whose fraters occupy a vast bastion. The bastion is said to have been built by the Black Templars, during Angevin's Crusade. Woe betide any inhabitants if the Templars return to claim their property.

# **DREAH**

This agri-world is noted the sector over for its grey skies, soil, plants and waters. Dreahans are notoriously dull, with pallid, greyish flesh and a sullen look to their faces. Traders are able to make large sums selling exotic dyes to the Dreahans. More unsavoury merchants have found a ripe market for hallucinogenic drugs, as Dreahans are particularly fond of the bright colours such substances make them see. The planetary governor is attempting to crack down on this trade, with little success.

# **DRUSUS SHRINE WORLD**

Also known as Sentinel, this planet stands at the rimward limits of the sector and is dedicated as a holy shrine world to Saint Drusus. A barren world, dominated by bleak dust bowls and salt-deserts, it supports, thanks to the Chartist ships, a population of pilgrims who maintain the shrine: a five thousand metre tall structure of ouslite and rockcrete located in the southern hemisphere. The shrine is the only significant artificial structure on the planet. There, high up in the draughty reaches of weathered stone, burns the eternal flame of Drusus, ministered to by the flocks of pilgrims, most of whom come to Sentinel to die. The standard of living is low on this bleak world and there is no system of government or order apart from the rubrics of the Imperial Creed. Outside the shrine—"beyond the shadow" as local slang has it—life is a fringe existence, to say the least. Endless, waterless deserts of dust and calcification stretch out to the very edges of the planet. Jettison collectors and scavengers may be found in the vast salt-licks, but they are transient. A well-supplied man might last twenty days in the barrens of this harsh world.

However, Sentinel is a world that draws visitors and explorers. Foremost are the pilgrims, those wishing to abase themselves at the foot of Drusus's shrine. For many, this is an act of suicide. Voyaging to the shrine world is vastly expensive and passage is hard to procure. Even if you get there, there is no guarantee of a return ticket. The licks beneath the shrine are littered with desiccated bones and mummified remains, sometimes in a thick carpet.

It is said that in the outer bowls of Sentinel, a man may find visions and answers. This rumour has undoubtedly arisen from the mind-altering effect of the emptiness and the heat. Even so, pilgrims come to the shrine and then head off, on foot, into the bleakness, in search of illumination. Any short ride by land car or flier from the shrine will reveal tortured bones lying in heaps at the end of long footprint trails that the wind has never erased. "Walking into silence" is what the shrine priests call this behaviour. Rumours suggest that, at the point of death, the silence speaks back to the true of heart.

Other rumours make mention of a xenos race living on the shrine world. Certainly there are several species of lustrous bug and beetle that thrive in the desert, drinking dew off their armored carapaces every dawn. The rumours talk of an ancient, insectoid race called the Whisperers, which lives, shelters and breeds in deep tunnels under the dry earth. Far from being an animalistic species, the Whisperers—if the insane rantings of a few, surviving silence walkers can be trusted—are a complex and ancient culture, tunnelling under the crust of Sentinel and only occasionally crawling to the surface. The Whisperers—so named because of the brushing sounds their giant wing cases make—are said to hold great truths and secrets about the cosmos, which may be learned by the aware and the capable. No relic or evidence of the Whisperers has ever been found.

# **DUSK**

The feral world of Dusk is noted for the extreme hostility of its native creatures. "A walk on Dusk" has become a byword for horrible and painful death amongst certain Rogue Traders and Chartist captains.

# **ENDRITE**

The degenerate medieval populace of this place worship the ruined hulk of an Imperial battlecruiser. It is not clear when this vessel crashed upon the planet, or what technological level its people were before the disaster.

# **FEDRID**

The thick forests of this feral world are so dense and so teeming with dangerous carnivores that access is forbidden without a licence. Fedrid is a favourite of game hunters and those individuals procuring animals for the Imperial arenas.

# **FENKSWORLD**

A small, grimy hive world to the coreward of the sector and the location of a substation depot of the Battlefleet Calixis. It is suggested that many cults and other "secret parties" test their influence on the Fenksworld population before moving on to dominant worlds like Scintilla and Malfi. Cults and cult activity certainly fester here. Fenksworld's most notable feature is its Library of Knowing, one of the sector's most comprehensive sources of data outside the Prol system. The Library of Knowing's most significant attribute is that it is run under the ordination of the planetary governor and exists outside general Imperial jurisdiction. The Calixian Conclave has made several (subtle) attempts to close the Fenksworld library down, due to its esoteric contents. The library remains a "family-run" enterprise, overseen by the planetary governor's family, the mercurial House Vaahkon.

# **GANF MAGNA**

Despite many purge efforts, this forested wilderness retains several pockets of Ork infestation, left over from the last invasion. They exist as small, tribal units of monsters in the dense forests. The Imperial settlers, mainly frontier farmers, wage a constant war with them.

# **GRANGOLD**

Heed Le hy de Te n A dead world on which stands—or, more appropriately, survives—a single temple to Saint Drusus, despite the ferocious elemental squall. The temple is staffed by two ancient dreadnoughts of the Iron Hands Chapter. The hazardous environment and volatile staff make this a dangerous shrine to approach, although it is said that "on Grangold, the saint answers all questions".

# **HEED**

A dead world and a battle site of Angevin's Crusade. Renowned for the noxious firestorms that pepper its surface.

# **KLYBO**

An extinct world, where the ruins of a lost colony poke from the shifting sands. Klybo's harsh environment spurned all efforts to settle it. The fleet maintains a waystation on a moon in close orbit.

Klybo has become proverbial over the years, indicating a worthless or doomed effort. "It all went like Klybo" or "I tried my best, but I had a day on Klybo" are common sector euphemisms.

Klybo attracts prospectors and tech-archaeologists. It is rumoured that fabulous STC finds are hidden on Klybo, remnants of the colonial attempts to settle the world. Several myths report "walking monsters", akin to Ambulon, still striding the wastelands. No form of conclusive data has yet been obtained.

# **LANDUNDER**

The limp, untrustworthy planetary crust of Landunder floats freely on a deep chemical ocean. The colonies here are built to cling underneath the planetary crust in suspension. There are eight "hanging" undercities, containing almost a billion inhabitants, with trade deriving from ocean-depth mining and chemical treatment (processing plants that exploit the curious mix of oceanic chemicals).

#  **THE LATHES**

A trio of quasi-worlds at the hem of the Malfian subsector, the Lathes are the foremost forge worlds of the sector, rivalling Scintilla's Gunmetal City for weapons manufacture. The three planetoids, Het, Hesh and Hadd, enjoy an irregular orbit around their star, intersecting to produce events of hyper-gravity. At such times, industry goes into frantic production, as the commingled gravitational urges of the passing planetoids allow for the specialist smelting of rare metals and alloys. Lathe-world blades are famed throughout the Calixis Sector for their unbreakable character. Gravitational duress also accounts for the dense, armor-piercing quality of Lathe-world ammunition. These so-called "body-blowers" are expensive and rare, and often purchased singly. The damage they can do to flesh is astonishing. Blades produced under gravitic circumstances on the Lathes are considered holy and special. Lord Hax owns a rapier of Lathe origin, presented to him by Magus Luol Rho, emissary of the Lathes at the court of Scintilla. It is rumoured that King Skull's sword is also an unbreakable tongue of Lathe manufacture.

The workforce of the Lathes is surprisingly small but all those born and bred on those oddly tangling planetoids are meaty, squat and powerful in their demeanour, and built with heavy bones and mounds of flesh.

The Lathes are held in the fealty of the Mechanicus of Mars, and are a secretive, closed environment. Visits require special permits and authority, and the Lathes are protected by a fraternity of warrior priests, who can call upon the power of Titans if the circumstances demand.

# **LEHYDE TEN**

A pleasant, potentially arable world, which is generally unpopulated. Angevin's annexation surveys identified Lehyde Ten as a colonial target, but all attempts to land terra-former mechanisms on the world have resulted in failure. The landscape is <span id="page-325-0"></span>littered with the dug-in, dormant hulks of Imperial land-makers. No one can explain the planet's resistance to development.

A small Imperial observatory station survives here, recording data from the Adranti Nebula. The crew turnover is alarming: a year or two on the world will, inexplicably, drive a man insane.

# **LUGGNUM**

A harsh and inhospitable mining colony with a small settlement called Lugg City which exports ores.

# **MALFI**

This hive world, eight hundred days standard from Scintilla, is the main population and manufacturing focal of the rimward territories of the sector. Malfi is a semitropical, gloomy world of overbuilt hives and habitation ledges. Its population approaches that of Scintilla and it subsists on its engineering and metalwork industries. The population of Malfi has a grudge: they believe that Malfi should be the sector capital world and venomously protest the supremacy of Scintilla.

Certainly, with its super-continental hives and eradication of natural landscape, Malfi resembles a Solar hiveworld far more than any of the other worlds in the sector, and its claim for capital eminence seems reasonable. However, politics and demographics are fickle mistresses. Scintilla is better placed to provide a centre of effective governance for the sector. Early regimes, following the Lord Angevin's campaign, made their headquarters on Malfi but the province has spread out since then. Despite its efforts, Malfi remains a border world, colossal in both its consumption and its production. It satisfies itself in commanding the Malfian subsector, ruling the territories rimward and spinward of Scintilla. The subsector governor, Jendrous Kaffiq, answers only to Lord Sector Hax himself. Malfi is a seat of the Administratum and several chief banking houses. Its nominal ruler is the Eminence Glydus Matriarch.

Malfi is—and this may be the very reason that the sector rulers passed over it—a place of the most infernal intrigue. It is impossible to count the courtly factions vying for power and the ear of the Matriarch. The central palace is a labyrinth of chambers and anterooms, a warren that, so proverbs say, many have entered and subsequently died trying to find a way out again. Guides may be procured to steer a visiting party through the warren of Malfi's central palace: they cannot be trusted. Every act and motion of Malfian life is about dissemblance and intrigue. Hire the wrong guide and you may be damned to years of squabbling diplomacy and sudden duels. It is said of the Malfian palace that "life has a thousand separate doors" and this is no exaggeration. Entering Malfian society, one enters a world of complexity and deceit. Few emerge alive.

The Calixian Conclave, which supports a district office on Malfi, regards the world as a particular hotbed of dissent and heresy. Apart from the many political factions and underground groups (many sponsored or run by Malfian noble houses) that support and promote Malfi's usurpation of the capital world role (it is worth noting that three times in the last two centuries, Malfian dissenters have almost triggered open civil war with Scintilla), the excessively secretive and disingenuous society of the Malfian hives propagates many sects and cults. These groups find it ridiculously simple to conceal themselves within Malfi's layered, elaborate culture of falsehood and deceit. They also find the hive citizenry to be a fertile source of amenable, pliable recruits. In recent years, the Conclave has become aware of a particularly active sect, whose reach is now spreading beyond Malfi.

# **THE MASQUED**

This "cult", which has strong connections to an alarming number of noble houses, is believed to have grown directly out of Malfi's culture of intrigue. Its original architects took the concepts of falsehood and subterfuge to their limits and arrived at the cult's guiding tenet: that nothing is what it seems. By extension, human life and the Imperium is a deceit, and Chaos itself is the truth. The Masqued believe that the "civilized Imperium" wears a mask of refinement and devoted duty, beneath which lies man's natural affinity with the lurid machinations of the warp. They believe that it is simply a matter of time before the mask falls away and mankind's true nature as a Chaotic species is revealed.

The Masqued revel in licentious, debauched behaviour and delight in extremes of falsehood and mendacity. All cult members are anonymous and wear, at their gatherings, grotesque and colourful masks derived from the styles worn at courtly masques and entertainments. The Masqued boasts, in its membership, a shockingly large number of nobles and highborn, for whom the cult is a mere extension of their courtly world; intrigue taken to its natural conclusion. It is likely that many of them have no real concept of the dark truth lurking at the centre of their compact. More a deviant secret society than an actual cult, the Masqued have avoided censure for a number of reasons: they have connections and influence, they are almost impossible to identify and target; and they offer no palpable threat as yet. The Masqued do not seem to be striving to achieve anything: their activities are more a broad excuse for licentious, orgiastic behaviour. Attempts made by the Calixian Conclave, in the most part abortive or unsuccessful, to infiltrate the order have revealed that the cult seems content to meet and worship, waiting for "the inevitable" to happen. They seem to show no desire or intent to bring about a chaotic revolution, as they regard it as a preordained fact. It is known that Caidin himself regards the Masqued as a "dilettante order", a grouping of deviants rather than an active threat, and therefore not a priority target. However, given the potential membership of the cult, and the wealth, resource and influence that implies, if the order ever did decide to become more proactive, it would be the richest and most insidious cult in the Segmentum. For this reason, several key figures in the Conclave believe that it should be dug out and sanctioned without delay.

The range of the cult's activity is alarming: suborders and satellite lodges have been noted on Scintilla, Sepheris Secundus, Iocanthos and many other high population worlds in the sector. Traces of it have been found as far away as Cypra Mundi and Eustis Majoris in the Scarus Sector. It goes wherever the noble houses of the Imperium have influence. Some say it has links all the way back to Terra. It is also chilling to reflect that, in the last three decades alone, four high-level operatives, each of unimpeachable character, sent by the Inquisition to infiltrate the cult, have later turned up as bonded members. It is an alluring, seductive order.

# **ORBEL QUILL**

An oddly serene, pastoral world of shepherd flocks and herding where, curiously, no one lives beyond the age of forty years standard. Often thought to be a rumour or a joke, the "death threshold" of Orbel Quill is quite real. Visitors and travellers must beware, as often they are far above the age of forty in sidereal terms. Anyone forty or over is stricken with a terminal decline and dies within thirty-six hours, even visitors who have amassed their years during ship-time. Many speculate that the planet is governed by some deep-seated system that combs out what it perceives to be the elderly. Certain facts are evident: no one has managed to identify what it is that kills the over-forties on Orbel Quill. Whatever it is, it certainly does kill them without exception. Also, xenos ruins in the southern hemisphere of the planet have never been properly explored.

It seems likely that it is no coincidence that Eldar have been regularly sighted in the empty quarters of this planet.

# **PROL IX**

This crowded, reddish-brown world is the current seat of the scholastic order known as the Decatalogues of Prol. This ninth planet of the "Scrivener's Star" is an ancient seat of the Administratum. Each of the nine planets is given over to record keeping, collation, statistical analysis, archiving and the like. Space is running out on Prol IX leading to a vicious schism within the ranks of the Decatalogues. The Centurists wish to move to the forbidden tenth planet within the system, whilst the Pyratics wish to destroy the ancient files stored upon Prol I and raise new temples of information from the ashes of the old. Violent debate and long, impeccably researched discourses are being exchanged between the two factions. These written arguments—some as many as one hundred and six volumes long—are not helping the chronic shortage of space.

# **SEEDWORLD AFG:218**

Believed to be an Eldar holding, whatever the truth, the world is evidently a place of geo-genic experimentation on the part of a xenos species. It is interdicted by a cordon of the Battlefleet Calixis.

# **SETTLEMENT 228**

A new colony (established four hundred years ago), seating eighteen thousand families on a dry, harsh settlement world. Though "cram beans" have proved a reasonably successful export crop, there is great unrest within Settlement 228's plantation farms. The settlement families, all exported from Scintilla, believe they were sold their land rights fraudulently. They claim that the planet is nothing like as viable as they were led to believe from the surveys. There is a strong anti-Imperium groundswell here and a hard-bitten drive towards revolution.

# **SLEEF**

This outworld, close to the Scarus Sector border, is unninhabited. However, it is famous for its sulphurous volcanic vents, through which, it is said, the voice of the warp whispers. It is said the skin of reality is thin there and one might hear the vibration of the immaterium, just out of reach.

# **SPECTORIS**

A waterworld with a thriving Imperial habitat, constructed on top of a submarine peak. With two million population this is the sector's largest exporter of fish and fish-meal product. The "Complete Ocean" of Spectoris is the subject of many legends, with some saying that there are sentient xeno forms of vast size inhabiting the unexplored depths of the world. Others claim that the world-ocean itself is sentient.

# **THRENOS**

Despised by Chartist vessels and Navigators, a satellite relay surrounds this system, blasting Imperial liturgy into the void of space upon all manner of frequencies. No one has travelled to the interior of Threnos's thirteen planets for some millennia, though it is rumoured to be lifeless.

# **TRANCH**

A minor hive world in the Adrantis Nebula, home to a longlasting and vicious civil war.

# **VAXANIDE**

Situated at the edge of sector territory, Vaxanide is a poorly supplied, desperate world, struggling to enter the "inner circle" of sector planets. It has decent mineral output and considerable exports of meat and fish, but it fights to survive. Its three billion population answers to Lord Vaxanide, scion of House Vaxanide, which has holdings on Scintilla, Malfi and Regulus. The economic degeneracy of Vaxanide results in it being a generally lawless, dangerous frontier world, especially beyond the precincts of the central hive, Vaxanhive. The planet is especially famed for its porcelain, glass and fish products. It is also the site of a shrine to Saint Drusus, where miracles are said to occur. Base rumours say that a hidden city exists in the canyons of the dense equatorial jungles. The city is said to be a mirror of the Lucid Palace, populated by phantoms of the actual Lucid Palace's denizens. All expeditions into the jungle areas have ended in failure, with few members returning alive. Those who survive are usually insane, raving of "grey death" stalking them, or simply ending their lives in a variety of messy ways.

# **WOE**

A death world. Extremely hazardous.

# **ZILLMAN'S DOMAIN**

A low tech level feudal world with a heavy Imperial tithe burden. Existence here is agricultural and frugal. The king owns a lasgun, which makes him king. The Domain is famous for its brutality and medieval mindset and accidental visitors are often burned at the stake as witches for possessing such items as vox-links.

The Domain was "visited" by the Spectral Sun eight years ago.

# Chapter II: Aliens & Witches Traits

A *"It is our destiny to rule the universe just as it is the destiny of the xeno to pave our way."*

— Lucretius VII, Inquisitor.

Arrayed against the Acolytes is a galaxy of adversaries, ranging from mortal foes to the most hideous horrors imaginable, each struggling to claw their way out from the warp and visit pain and incalculable suffering on those they encounter. Whilst Dark Heresy is a game of investigation, suspense and fearsome environments, it is also a game set in a universe overwhelmed with conflict and war. Thus, it stands to reason that over the course of a character's career, he will undoubtedly face a veritable army of foes.

# TRAITS

Skills and Talents represent ability and knowledge gained over the course of a character's life. Traits, then, are innate abilities gained by virtue of birth and racial circumstance. They may be gained through other means later in life, but they are almost never gained through choice. As indicated in **Chapter I: Character Creation**, Player Characters acquire certain Traits as a result of their birth world, their destiny as revealed to them by their Imperial Divination, and later as they acquire madness, corruption and potentially mutations. Other characters in the universe of Dark Heresy have Traits too, features inherited from their particular type of species or their environment. S

# **TRAIT DESCRIPTIONS**

# **Amorphous**

An amorphous creature has a malleable form, capable of squeezing its body or expanding it. It can change Size by one step in either direction, though doing so does not change its speed. Creatures with this Trait determine their movement rates using half their Agility Bonus. Amorphous creatures are often missing senses and so rely on the Unnatural Senses trait to perceive their surroundings.

# **armor Plating**

The creature is encased in armor plating, increasing its armor Points by 2 to all locations.

# **Auto-stabilised**

The creature always counts as braced when firing heavy weapons and may fire on semi- or full-automatic as a Half Action.

# **Bestial**

A creature with this Trait is animalistic, tending to behave instinctively rather than rationally. No matter how high its Intelligence score is, it is still bestial. A creature with this Trait never needs to make a Survival Test whilst in its natural habitat. Unless starving or desperate, a bestial creature must make a Willpower Test when frightened, startled or injured. On a failed Test, the creature flees.

# **Blind**

Blind creatures automatically fail all Tests based on vision and automatically fail all Ballistic Skill Tests. Such creatures take a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and most other Tests that ordinarily involve or are benefited by vision.

# **Brutal Charge**

A creature with this Trait deals an extra 3 points of Damage when it charges in the same Round.

# **Burrower**

A creature with this Trait can move through solid objects by burrowing through them. This Trait always includes a number to indicate speed. Such creatures can burrow through soil, rock, sand and so on, and some (expressed in the creature entry) can burrow through metal. When a creature burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel. Creatures of one size smaller than the creature that created the tunnel can enter these areas without impediment. There's a 50% chance each Round that the tunnel collapses behind the creature.

# **Crawler**

Worms, serpents and similar creatures crawl and slither rather than walk. The move for a creature with this Trait is half its Agility Bonus, but it does not take penalties for moving over Difficult Terrain.

# **Daemonic**

Daemonic creatures are creatures of the warp, but can manifest in realspace either through sheer strength of will, hunger or occult rituals. Creatures with this Trait double their Toughness Bonus against all Damage, except for Damage inflicted by force weapons, Psychic Powers, holy attacks or other creatures with this Trait. Daemonic creatures are also immune to poison and disease.

# **Dark Sight**

A creature with this Trait sees normally even in areas of total darkness and never takes a penalty for fighting in areas of dim or no lighting.

# **Incorporeal**

Incorporeal creatures are insubstantial and weightless, able to pass through solid objects such as walls and weapons. An incorporeal creature gains a +30 bonus on Concealment Tests when hiding inside something. If it so wishes, it may become completely silent, automatically passing any Silent Move Tests that it is required to make.

An incorporeal creature is also immune to normal weapons they simply pass through its body as if it wasn't there. Daemons, Psychic Powers, warp creatures, other incorporeal creatures and opponents armed with force weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An incorporeal creature can't normally affect the mortal world and thus can't damage nonincorporeal opponents unless it has a suitable special ability or Talent. Creatures with the Incorporeal trait can Damage other creatures with the Incorporeal trait normally.

Certain devices can keep an incorporeal creature at bay, most notably the Geller field of a spaceship. Creatures with this Trait cannot pass through such a field.

# **Fear (variable)**

A creature with this Trait has an unnerving appearance. Its Fear Rating (1–4) reflects just how awful the creature is to behold. The higher the Fear Rating the harder it is for others to resist going insane from the encounter, as shown on the following chart.

| Fear Rating | Description | Penalty |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 1           | Disturbing  | 0       |
| 2           | Frightening | -10     |
| 3           | Horrifying  | -20     |
| 4           | Terrifying  | -30     |

When a character encounters a creature with this Trait, he must make a Willpower Test, modified by the severity of the creature's Trait. On a success, the character may act as normal. On a failure, the character must roll on **Table 8-4: The Shock Table** on **[page 233](#page-233-0)**, adding

# **Threat Rating**

All the creatures and Dramatis Personae in Dark Heresy have a threat rating in their description based on the classifications used by the Ordos Calixis. The threat rating is divided into two; the first part of which designates the nature of the threat posed, and the second being the degree of threat posed to the Imperium.

### **Threat Designation**

**Hereticus:** The threat comes from within humanity, such as heretical thought, criminality, rebellion, rogue mutants, witches and the like.

**Xenos:** The threat comes from a species other than mankind; be it the alien itself or a product of the alien's blasphemous nature, influence or technology.

**Malleus:** The threat comes from the warp, and is either a being born of that infernal realm or is infused by its power.

**Obscuro:** The nature of the threat is either unknown, resists analysis or it falls outside the normal categories of danger. This threat classification is also in rare circumstances applied to forbidden dangers of mankind's own forgotten antiquity.

# **Grade of Threat**

**Minima:** In small numbers the threat is minimal and only likely to affect isolated or weak individuals. Still potentially dangerous to the unprepared or inexperienced Imperial servant.

**Minoris:** In numbers the threat can pose a severe threat to those who confront it. However, unless encountered in large numbers or allied to greater forces, it is unlikely to pose a threat to the Imperium's control over a particular world or the local dominion of the God Emperor.

**Majoris:** Constitutes a considerable physical or moral threat to a civilian population, hazardous to Imperial agents and in large numbers the threat would require specialised or mass forces to neutralise. Containment of such threats, especially the prevention of widespread knowledge or contact with them by the civilian population, is considered crucial.

**Extremis:** The threat poses a lethal threat to those who encounter it and is by its very nature or power enough to require the most powerful of responses. Such threats endanger the safety of whole worlds if left unchecked, and, if not locally confined, can have wider implications for the dominion of the God Emperor.

**Terminus:** The level of threat posed is such that almost any deployment of forces to combat it is likely to result in serious loss. Such a threat can only be eliminated with extreme prejudice, and if widespread, entrenched or accelerating in severity, then the consideration must be given to the use of the most exceptional measures.

+10 to the roll for every degree of failure by which the Willpower Test failed. The results of this roll have variable effects, but generally leave the character a gibbering mess. For more details on the effects of Fear and Insanity, see **Chapter VIII: The Game Master**.

# **Flyer**

A creature with this Trait has the natural ability to fly, whether with broad leathery wings, strange warp energies or inflatable gas sacs. This Trait always includes a number to indicate at what speeds it moves when it flies. For more details on flying, see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**.

# **From Beyond**

The mind of a creature with this Trait is beyond the petty frailties and precarious sanity of a mortal mind. It is immune to Fear, Pinning, Insanity Points and Psychic Powers used to cloud, control or delude its mind.

# **Hoverer**

Creatures with this Trait have a limited capability for flight, flying no higher than two metres. As with the Flyer trait, this Trait always includes a number to indicate speed. For more details on flying, see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**.

# **Machine**

A creature with the Machine trait is fashioned from inorganic materials and is generally more rigorous than fleshy folks. Machines do not breathe, are immune to the effects of a vacuum, extremes of cold and any mind-influencing psychic effect. Their armor Points apply towards fire Damage. Machines are also resilient to injury, having 1 to 5 armor Points for each location. This number is indicated next to the Trait.

# **MultipleArms**

This creature has more than one pair of arms. It increases its Toughness Characteristic by +10 and gains a +10 bonus on Strength Tests involving movement such as Climb and Swim. Finally, the creature may use the Multiple Attack Action to gain two attacks on its Turn.

# **Naturalarmor**

This creature has a naturally tough hide or an exoskeleton, affording it some protection against attacks. This Trait always includes a numeric value to indicate how many armor Points the creature gains to all locations.

# **Natural Weapons**

This creature has sharp claws, teeth, spines or some other natural weapon with which it can slice and dice its foes. It counts as being armed even when not wielding weapons. Its attacks deal 1d10 points of Damage plus its Strength Bonus. The creature may make attacks with its Natural Weapons using its Weapon Skill, though it cannot Parry with its natural weapons, nor can it be disarmed—unless, of course, you hack off its limbs! Natural weapons always count as Primitive.

# **Phase**

A creature with this Trait can transform its body into an insubstantial state, passing ghost-like through solid objects or barriers of any sort. This Trait functions exactly like the Incorporeal trait, except the creature may become solid or insubstantial by spending a Half Action.

Phase carries additional limitations. A creature in a phased state cannot cross psychically charged barriers, holy wards, or energy fields designed to flux space or manipulate the warp such as a Geller field or a void shield.

# **Possession**

Certain spirit-beings and denizens of the warp have the ability to possess mortal bodies. This is a far more insidious and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or even the power of the strongest psykers to "ware" the bodies of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is merged with the victim's living body on a fundamental level so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below, although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may vary. Note that Daemonhosts, being extraordinary powerful examples of deliberate, ritualistic possessions, designed to bind and control Daemons in living vessels, are a special case and dealt with separately.

# **The Possession Attack**

The entity must be within a few metres of its intended victim and use a Full Action. The creature and target make Opposed Willpower Tests each Round until either the entity or the victim achieve a total of five degrees of success over the other—this is cumulative over several Rounds. If the entity wins, it successfully possesses its victim. If its victim wins, he has repelled the entity who may not attempt to possess him again for 24 hours. A repelled entity also takes 1d10 points of Damage.

# **The Effects of Possession**

A possessing entity takes control utterly, binding itself to its victim, and is capable of commanding the body to function regardless of pain and injury (and indeed might delight in damaging or altering it to suit its whims). The victim increases his Strength and Toughness Characteristics by 10 and gains 1d10 Wounds. The victim uses the possessing entity's Intelligence, Perception, Willpower and Fellowship, and uses the entity's Psy Rating and Psychic Powers in place of its own (if any). Likewise, the possessed creature uses any mind-related Skills and Talents had by the entity and loses its own.

The entity may also attempt to recall memories and skills from its victim with a successful Intelligence Test. In the case of possession by a Daemon, the victim has a good chance of becoming immediately mutated and likely to become further mutated the longer the possession continues.

# **Surviving Possession**

Should the victim survive and the entity is cast out by exorcism or some other means, then the ordeal reduces the character's Toughness and Willpower Characteristics by 2d10 permanently. In addition, the victim gains 1d10 Insanity Points.

# **Quadruped**

Quadrupeds are much quicker over a distance than their bipedal counterparts. To calculate their movement, double their Agility Bonus. This Trait is intended to cover creatures with hind legs and forepaws. Creatures with more than four legs may gain this Trait but they increase the Agility Bonus by 1 multiplier for every extra set of legs (six legs equals AB×3, eight legs AB×4 and so on).

# **Regeneration**

Creatures with this Trait heal very quickly. Each Round, at the start of its Turn, the creature Tests Toughness to remove 1 point of Damage. It loses this Trait when slain.

# **Size**

# **Trait Groups: Minuscule, Puny, Scrawny, Hulking, Enormous, Massive**

Creatures come in one of seven different size categories, as shown on the following chart. Size affects movement and how easy or hard it is to strike that creature in combat. (When calculating movement, apply the size modifier first, and then other modifiers from other Traits or Talents.) For the purposes of comparison, a human is an average-sized creature.

| Table 12–2: Creature Size Modifiers |          |             |               |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-------------|---------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Size                                | Modifier | Concealment | Base Movement |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Minuscule                           | –30      | +30         | AB–3          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Puny                                | –20      | +20         | AB–2          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Scrawny                             | –10      | +10         | AB–1          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Average                             | 0        | 0           | AB            |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Hulking                             | +10      | –10         | AB+1          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Enormous                            | +20      | –20         | AB+2          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Massive                             | +30      | –30         | AB+3          |  |  |  |  |  |  |

# **Sonar Sense**

A creature with this Trait perceives its surroundings by emitting a frequency noise, allowing the creature to locate the position of any solid object within 30 metres. Other creatures within range, and that succeed on a Difficult (–10) Awareness Test, may detect the curious keening.

# **Soul-bound**

The soul of this creature is bound to a higher purpose or being, in return for a measure of protection. When this Trait is first gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially astropaths, are soul-bound to the Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos sorcerers may be bound to one of the Ruinous Powers. A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional d10 when forced to roll on **Table 6-3: Perils of the Warp** on **[page 163](#page-163-0)**, discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result.

Upon becoming soul-bound, a character must choose one of the following effects: 1d10 Insanity Points, the permanent loss of sight, the permanent loss of 1d10 from one Characteristic or a random mutation (only if soul-bound to the Ruinous Powers).

In addition, a soul-bound character is permanently indebted to the entity, which undoubtedly entails all manner of other duties and consequences.

# **Stampede**

Whenever a creature with this Trait fails a Willpower Test, it automatically stampedes, charging in a straight line forwards as far as possible, overrunning anything in its path until the source of danger is escaped or crushed under hoof, taking Damage equal to the creature's Natural Weapon Damage (or 1d5+SB I if it doesn't have one). One stampeding creature automatically causes all other creatures within sight to stampede. The stampede lasts until the source of danger is no longer visible or for 1d10 minutes, whichever occurs last.

# **Strange Physiology**

A creature with this Trait has an unusual, alien, or altogether bizarre anatomy. All hits count as Body hits and death results when Damage equals or exceeds the creature's Wounds.

# **The Stuff of Nightmares**

Some warp entities are so terribly powerful that their will perpetuating their bodies in our reality is almost impossible to break or disrupt. Such entities are completely immune to the effects of poisons, diseases, the need to breathe, most environmental hazards, Blood Loss, Stunning and any Critical result other than one that would destroy them outright, unless caused by a Psychic Power, force weapon or holy attack.

# **Sturdy**

Sturdy creatures are hard to move and thus gain a +20 bonus to Tests made to resist Grappling and uses of the Takedown talent.

# **Toxic**

A creature with this Trait is poisonous. The toxins might be delivered through the creature's attacks, in which case a target hit by its natural weapons must make a Toughness Test. The toxins might instead be delivered by contact with the creature's skin or by inhaling its stench, in which case a Toughness Test must be made upon coming into contact or proximity. A failed Toughness Test indicates that the victim has been poisoned. A typical poison deals 1d10 points of Damage, ignoring armor Points. Variations, if present, are included in the creature's description.

# **Unnatural Characteristic**

One or more of the creature's Characteristics is unnatural. Each time this Trait is gained, select a Characteristic and double its bonus. For example, *a creature with a Strength of 41 normally has a 4 Strength Bonus. With this Trait, its Strength Bonus increases to 8*.

The Trait may be gained multiple times. Each time, you may select a new Characteristic or one chosen previously. Each time you apply this Trait to the same Characteristic, the Bonus multiplier increases by 1. For example, *one selection multiplies the Characteristic Bonus by ×2, two selections by ×3, and three selections ×4. Note that this Trait does not modify the creature's movement.*

Applying this Trait to Agility does not increase a creature's movement. Movement is based on a creature's unmodified Agility Bonus.

During Opposed Characteristic Tests, on a success the bonus multiplier is added to the degree of success. For example, *Gybalt (S32) is trying to break free of the grip of a Daemon (S35, Unnatural Strength (*×*2)). This is an Opposed Strength Test with Gybalt rolling* 

*12 (2 degrees of success) versus the Daemon's roll of 15 (2 degrees of success plus 2 from the Unnatural Strength, a total of 4 degrees of success). Gybalt fails to shake off the Daemon.*

# **Unnatural Senses**

The creature can perceive its surroundings using senses other than sight or hearing, using special organs, fine hairs or some other disturbing quality to make itself aware of what's around it. This Trait always includes a range, usually 15 metres.

# **Unnatural Speed**

The creature moves with incredible speed. For the purposes of determining movement, the creature doubles its Agility Bonus (after modifying AB from other Traits and factors, specifically size).

# **Warp Instability**

Most warp entities have a tenuous hold on our reality, often maintained only by horror and bloodshed, and may be disrupted if sufficient harm can be done to their manifested forms. If a creature with this Trait takes Damage and does not deal Damage or Insanity Points on other creatures by the end of its next Turn, it must make a Willpower Test. The creature takes 1 Damage for failure, plus 1 Damage for each degree of failure. If this would deal Damage equal to or in excess of the creature's Wounds, it is cast back into the warp.

# **Warp Weapon**

Creatures with this Trait have weapons that are partially insubstantial, able to ignore such mundane things as armor or cover. Natural weapons and attacks made by a creature with this Trait ignore physical armor unless it is created from psychoactive materials or carries the holy quality. Force fields still work against these attacks normally.

# MUTATIONS

One of the most pervasive signs of corruption in the Imperium is the manifestation of mutations. These subtle, or not-so-subtle, changes in the flesh can result from exposure to toxic pollutants, alien biospheres, genetic engineering, radiation and other hazards, while others might result from exposure to the warp, Daemonic possession and other perils of the universe. The level of tolerance for mutants varies planet to planet. Subtle or cosmetic changes are accepted, and such beings are regarded as abhumans or subs, who in some worlds form an oppressed and exploited underclass. Truly horrific mutants are purged on sight wherever they are found.

# **GAINING MUTATIONS**

Characters, creatures and so on, acquire mutations in a variety of ways, but the most common cause is through physical corruption. Warped environments, chemicals, illegal drugs and so on, can all result in mutation and there are few safeguards to prevent a mutation once it takes root. Mutations function as Traits, meaning that characters cannot purchase them with Experience Points.

# **Mutation**

Whenever a mutation occurs, roll either for a Minor Mutation on **Table 12-3: Minor Mutations,** or Major Mutations on **Table 12-4: Major Mutations** to discover what type of mutation is gained. Always re-roll duplicate results.

# Table 12-3: Minor Mutations

### **Roll D100 Effect**

| 01–20 | Grotesque: The mutant is either badly deformed, scarred or bestial, marking it as accursed and impure, Fellowship       |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       | Tests with 'normals' are made at –20, but the mutant has a +10 bonus to Intimidate Tests.                               |
| 21–30 | Tough Hide: The mutant has 1 AP worth of Natural armor thanks to dense skin and scar tissue.                           |
| 31–40 | Misshapen: The mutant's spine and/or limbs are horribly twisted, giving it a penalty of –1d10 to its Agility.           |
| 41–50 | Feels No Pain: The mutant cares little for injury or harm and gains +1 Wound.                                           |
| 51–60 | Brute: The mutant is physically powerful with deformed masses of muscle. Apply +10 Strength, +10 Toughness and          |

| 86–89 | Tox Blood: The mutant's system is saturated with toxic pollutants and poisonous chemicals. As a result it has a         |
|       | +10 resistance to toxins and poisons, however it suffers a –1d10 penalty to its Intelligence and Fellowship.            |
| 90–99 | Wyrdling: The mutant has Minor Psychic Powers that it has so far been able to conceal. The mutant has a Psy             |

# Table 12-4: Major Mutations

**Roll D100 Effect**

01–25 **Vile Deformity:** The mutant is marked by some terrible deformity that shows the touch of the warp and should not exist in a rational universe. There is no end to the dire forms this might take such as writhing tentacles in place of arms, skinless glistening flesh, re-arranged facial features or thousands of restless eyes studding the body, to name but a few. The mutant gains the Disturbing trait.

26–35 **Aberration:** The mutant has become a weird hybrid of man and animal (or reptile, insect, etc.) Apply +10 Strength, +10 Agility, –1d10 Intelligence, -10 Fellowship and the Sprint talent.

- 36–40 **Degenerate Mind:** The mutant's mind is warped and inhuman. Apply –1d10 Intelligence, +10 Fellowship, roll 1d10 and apply the following Talents or Trait: **1–3:** Frenzy, **4–7:** Fearless, **8–0:** From Beyond.
- 41–50 **Ravaged Body:** The mutant's body has been entirely re-made by the warp. Roll 1d5 times on **Table 12-3: Minor Mutations**, re-rolling duplicate rolls. Such mutations, regardless of their nature, still show the obvious taint of Chaos.
- 51–60 **Clawed/Fanged:** The mutant gains razor claws, a fanged maw, barbed flesh or some other form of Natural Weapon that inflicts 1d10 R or I Primitive damage in close combat.
- 61–65 **Necrophage:** The mutant gains +10 Toughness and the Regeneration trait, but must sustain itself on copious quantities of raw meat or starve.
- 66–70 **Corrupted Flesh:** Beneath the mutants' skin a blasphemous transformation has taken place, exchanging living organs for writhing creatures and blood for ichorous, maggot-ridden filth. If the mutant suffers Critical Damage, those witnessing it must take a Fear Test at –10.
- 71–75 **Vile Alacrity:** The mutant is constantly juddering and shaking unnaturally and can move almost faster than sight. It gains the Unnatural Agility (x2) trait and the Sprint talent, with a penalty of –10 to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill.
- 76–80 **Hideous Strength:** The mutant gains the Unnatural Strength (x2) trait.
- 81–85 **Multiple Appendages:** The mutant has sprouted additional functioning limbs in the shape of arms, tentacles or a prehensile tail (or tails). Gain the Ambidextrous and Two-Weapon Wielder talents and +10 bonus on Climb Tests and Grapple attacks.
- 86–90 **Worm:** The mutant's lower limbs have fused together to form a worm or snake-like tail. They gain the Crawler trait, +5 Wounds and the Disturbing trait.
- 91–92 **Nightmarish:** So warped and horrific is the mutant's appearance, it can cause enemies to flee in fear. It gains the Frightening trait.
- 93–94 **Malleable:** The mutant possesses a sickeningly liquid flexibility and is able to distend and flatten its body. Apply +10 Agility and +20 to Climb Tests, and Grappling attacks. They may also fit through spaces only one-quarter its usual body dimensions.
- 95–96 **Winged:** The mutant's body has warped to accommodate a pair of leathery wings or the like. They gain the Flyer trait (1d10+5).
- 97–98 **Corpulent:** The mutant's huge and bloated frame gives them +5 Wounds and the Unnatural Toughness (x2) trait. This mutation means that the mutant may not run.
- 99 **Corrosive Bile:** The mutant may vomit burning bile, flesh-eating grubs or some other horrific substance instead of attacking normally in close combat. The attack uses the mutant's BS, is a Full Action and can be Dodged but not Parried. This attack inflicts 1d10+5 R (or E) Tearing Damage.
- 00 **Hellspawn:** Saturated with the energies of the warp, the mutant is imbued with Daemonic energies and gains the From Beyond, Frightening and Daemonic traits and a Psy Rating of 2.

# **DRAMATIS PERSONAE**

M Most adversaries that Acolytes face are of the mundane sorts, being hardened thugs, twisted mutants, soldiers and political rivals. The following entries describe some common foes that the Player Characters are likely to encounter as they tear back the grim facade and stare deep into the abyss of corruption. Do note that weapons, armor and gear are typical for these characters, but are not necessarily consistent for all such characters. Modify an entry's gear to suit your needs. Also note that in the instance of melee weapon Damage, SB has already been factored in.

# **Arbitrator**

The Adeptus Arbites are the iron fist of Imperial law. Arbitrators are the militant arm of the Imperial judiciary and the first line of defence against heresy and rebellion, empowered in extremis to take control of a world should its ruling bodies fall from grace.

# **Astropath**

Without the astropaths of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica there would be no Imperium. Every message transmitted between the stars must be passed telepathically between thousands of psykers known as astropaths. Without this living web of communication, mankind's galactic civilisation would be impossible.

# **Bounty Hunter**

The kind of killer skilled enough to hunt down warranted criminals and renegades within an underhive, or even between worlds, is a dangerous individual. Bounty hunters are lethal beyond any mere ganger or scum—often even more so than their quarry.

# **Cult Fanatic**

The terrible revelations that involvement in a proscribed cult can bring can break the sanity of the strongest. Such "touched" individuals still remain useful to the cult as guards, lackeys and handy sacrifices.

# **Cult Initiate**

Like cancer cells in the body of the Imperium, hidden conspiracies, blasphemous religions and forbidden creeds fester and ferment in the shadows, and there is no shortage of hapless souls ready to join their ranks.

# **Cult Magus**

The higher echelons of many cults venerating the Ruinous Powers are peopled with men and woman who have sold their souls in return for occult power.

### **Sorcery!**

Though not a true psyker, a witch can wield the power of the warp through incantation and sorcery. To reflect the eldritch and esoteric methods they employ, all their Psychic Powers need a Full Action to use (regardless of the actual focus time) and their Psychic Powers have a Psychic Threshold of +2. A Cult Magus must be able to speak and gesture freely in order to use Psychic Powers. Also, the practice of the dark arts is far from safe, even compared to the use of a psyker's abilities, and they must add +20 to the results of any Psychic Phenomena and Perils of the Warp rolls that they incur.

# **Dreg**

The lowest of the low, dregs, sometimes known as scavvies or wasters, are addicts, degenerates, outcasts, madmen and worse. Utterly desperate, and often ruined in body and mind, some of them can be far more dangerous than any sane man, and willing to do anything for very little payment at all…

# **Citizen**

The Imperium contains countless billions of men and women, from the hab-workers trudging to and from the manufactora day after day, to the ratings that bloody their feet treading the wheels of magazine hoists on the Emperor's warships, to the ore miners whose short lives feed the Imperium's iron heat.

# **Combat Servitor**

Combat servitors are armed with highly effective combat weaponry and programmed with basic weapon routines to use them.

# **Dissolute Noble**

When the most privileged go bad, they go very bad indeed. With money and influence, a noble can fall into all manner of depravities that are to them no more than mere pastimes to alleviate the boredom of excess.

# **Enforcer**

While the Adeptus Arbites are the vigilant guardians of Imperial law, everyday policing and enforcement of local laws falls to a planet's own security forces. Variously called chasteners, prefects, watchmen or any other number of local titles on different worlds, such security forces are most commonly referred to as enforcers.

# **Entertainer**

Given the often crushing misery of life, it is no surprise that a little escape is often desirable for the masses, and entertainment in the Imperium has a tendency towards the simple, direct and visceral.

**Enforcer**

Across the Imperium, in smelteries and forge factories, huge crucibles pour rivers of white-hot metal into moulds and the air is filled with sparks. Amidst the glow, figures lumber under the weight of vulcanised rubber suits, their eyes hidden behind smoked-glass goggles.

# **Heretek**

Technology is little understood and rightly feared. Hereteks are criminals who specialise in the dark arts of tech-reclamation, science and salvage outside the rightful purview of the Cult Mechanicus, and risk "recycling" into a more productive life as a servitor if the Priesthood of Mars gets hold of them. Some hereteks are little more than scavengers, others are dangerous renegades that supply the underworld with proscribed drugs or arms, and the worst delve into matters best left alone.

# **Industrial or Heavy Repair Servitor**

These servitors have been modified with rigs to lift loads, drill rocks or smash ore in one of the Imperium's countless industrial complexes, or are fused with specialised repair gear.

# **Kill Squad Trooper**

Used to enforce execution warrants or when extreme prejudice is required, the kill squads are some of the most dangerous formations that can exist within an enforcer organisation. On some worlds, where the rule of the planetary governor is dictatorial and harsh, kill squads are the hated embodiments of their power.

# **Heavy**

Dumb muscle always has a market for hire, and many thugs, cut-throats and brawlers augment their own prowess with crude vat-grown muscle implants, dangerous chemical treatments and brain-damaging combat drugs.

Ministorum Preacher

# **Ministorum Preacher**

To countless billions, the Emperor is nothing less than a god. Over the millennia this faith has created a vast and powerful organisation devoted to His worship; the Ministorum. It is made up of countless ranks and divisions from the deacons, cardinals and high ecclesiarchs that govern the faith to the numberless priests, preachers, mendicants, rectors, psalters, scribes and choristers that make up the body of the priesthood.

# **Mutant**

Mutation is a sad fact of human existence in the Imperium, and on many worlds the human gene pool has become irrevocably damaged by generations of exposure to pollutants and alien biospheres. Mutants tolerated by the Imperium are generally referred to as abhumans (sometimes even being classified by the Administratum) and often allowed to toil in slave-like conditions in factories and hives.

# **Mutant Abomination**

Worse by far than any tragic unfortunate, born twisted from the effects of pollutants and radiation, is the mutant struck down and remade by the influence of the warp. These are the lost and damned; their bodies have become the clay of an insane and macabre sculptor, and their minds and souls tainted beyond salvation.

# **Recidivist**

Scum they say rises to the surface—and it's true that there are always those skilled, amoral or clever enough to rise to prominence in the underworld. These crime lords, slavers, fencers and fixers can fulfil many different roles, but the Arbites give them a single damning title, recidivists, and they live like parasites on the soft underbelly of the Imperium.

# **Tech Adept**

The ancient priesthood of Mars, the Adeptus Mechanicus are the only sanctioned repositories of scientific thought and technological lore in the Imperium. Steeped in arcane ritual and labyrinthine dogma, to them their arts are a divine mystery of their incarnation of the Emperor—the Omnissiah, and to them all things technological are sacred.

These are fully initiated acolytes of the Cult Mechanicus and form the bulk of its ordained priesthood.

# **Witch**

Witches are a breed of rogue psykers and mystics who have rejected the Imperium and all it stands for, and embraced the fell powers of Chaos. Madmen, lunatics and vile heretics, they are hunted by Inquisitors and destroyed wherever they are found.

# **Brain Leaf**

Few would believe that of all the enemies faced by mankind, a greyish vine-like plant could pose such an insidious threat. Variously referred to as "slave vine" or "the grey weed", but most commonly the "brain leaf ", this malignant creature was once thought to originate from the jungle death world of Catachan. In physical form, the brain leaf plant resembles a coarse vine or ivy, each tendril of which is tipped with a single fleshy leaf. Uniquely, the brain leaf possesses a form of gestalt consciousness, and each leaf is a macro-cell forming part of its utterly alien intelligence. The underside of each vine leaf is barbed to latch onto creatures straying too close and, once attached to a victim, microscopic fibre bundles penetrate the skin and extrude fibrous growths throughout a victim's nervous system to take control of its body utterly. Though not sentient in any measurable sense, the brain leaf efficiently and swiftly dominates its victim, subverting it to the will of the parent plant. Once this has been accomplished, the leaf detaches from the main body and remains as an attached parasite on the victim, allowing a new leaf to rapidly grow in its place. The victim, now a staggering thrall to the brain leaf plant, is used by the weed to protect itself and proliferate its young.

Infestations of brain leaf have been discovered on many worlds, and recent emergent evidence is that the brain leaf is no true native of Catachan, but likely a rogue mutation and evolutionary descendant of the Tyranid cortex leech, makes the destruction of any infestation a priority for many in the Ordo Xenos Calixis. The horrors visited on members of the sector's nobility during the infamous "Slaughter Gardens of Quaddis" incident several years ago have emphasised the need to prevent the spawning and multiplication of this foul vine.

# **The Brain Leaf Plant**

The vine is most often encountered wrapped parasitically around another large plant or tree, or crawling across the face of some statue or edifice, and varies in size according to maturity. Some of a brain leaf 's Characteristics vary according to how much it has grown and there are three levels of growth listed here: Immature, Mature and Ancient.

**Movement:** — **Wounds:** 40

**Traits:** Limited Actions† , Size (Scrawny for immature, Average for mature, Hulking for ancient), Strange Physiology, Taking Control‡ .

† **Limited Actions:** The only Action a brain leaf may perform is an attempt to latch on to a victim within half a metre of one of its leaves.

‡ **Taking Control:** A brain leaf 's victim is nearly always unaware of the danger he is in and has a single chance to feel the prick of the leaf 's barbs, and rip it off before it is too late. A resilient, sealed covering over the victim's head and neck (sufficient to provide 2 AP) can protect against an attack. At the moment that a leaf makes contact, the target must succeed on an Agility Test or the leaf latches on and rapidly begins to subvert the victim's nervous system, causing the victim to fall prone and twitch. It takes 1d10 minutes to infiltrate the victim's nervous system fully and, if the leaf is removed during this time, the victim recovers consciousness but loses 1d10 points permanently from Toughness and gains 1d10 Insanity Points. Unless the process is stopped, after the required time has passed, the victim becomes a Brain Leaf Thrall.

# **Brain Leaf Thrall**

Thralls of the brain leaf are completely under the control of the malign plant, turning them into nerve-damaged, drooling, twitching shamblers. Modify the thrall Characteristics as follows. Where a "—" is listed, it indicates that the creature loses this Characteristic and can no longer take or fail Tests based on it.

| Brain Leaf Thrall Profile Adjustment |     |    |     |     |     |     |    |     |  |

### **Wounds:** Halve.

**Skills, Talents and Powers:** The thrall loses all Skills, Talents and Psychic Powers whilst enthralled. All thralls gain the Fearless talent. They react sluggishly; their only evident behaviour is to stand sentry over their parent plant, hurling themselves spasmodically against anything threatening it.

### **Recovering from Thralldom**

Should the leaf be ripped from a thrall, the thrall mmediately lets out a horrific scream of agony and collapses unconscious, as the severing of the plant's control causes a massive trauma to the victim's nervous system. Once the leaf is removed, a thrall must pass a Toughness Test or die. If he survives he recovers but retains the reduction of Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Toughness, Agility and Perception as permanent Characteristic Damage. The released thrall also gains 3d10 Insanity Points. **Threat Rating:** Xenos Minoris.

# **Dusk Stalker**

A terrifying creature that has become the stuff of dark fable across the Calixis Sector, the stalker is one of the most feared of Dusk's many dangers, haunting the deepest swamps of that world. In appearance, it resembles a frightening hybrid of a withered elderly human and gigantic four-limbed spider.

# **Grox**

The demand for meat and livestock to feed the Imperium's countless mouths is immense, and while dozens of other (and far more palatable) species such as spiralhorns, demi-pach and tusk bison are common, it is the Grox that has become the Imperium's widest used staple.

# **Nightwing**

The ill-famed world of Dusk is known for its many horrific creatures and sinister predators, and the Nightwing is no exception. A nocturnal creature, strange and disturbing to look upon, its amber, slug-like body is the length of a man's arm and nearly featureless but for a small round mouth surrounded by hook-like barbs at one end.

This is a poisonous attack.

‡**Sucking Bite**: If a Nightwing successfully bites its prey, it automatically latches on and drains its victim's blood. Each Round, the Nightwing deals 1d10 points of Toughness Damage until the victim's Toughness falls to 0, at which point death occurs. In addition, the sucking bite inflicts 1 level of Fatigue per Round. The Nightwing can be removed by winning an Opposed Strength Test. While a Nightwing is attached, all melee attacks against it gain a +20 bonus.

**Weapons:** Bite (1d10+3 R; Primitive). **Threat Rating:** Xenos Minima.

# **Sabre-Wolf**

The Sabre-wolf is a custom-bred apex predator. Created by centuries of cross-breeding mutant creatures and xenos predators, its hunting grounds are the pleasure parks of the Calixis elite and, in some cases, the fighting pits of the less wealthy. Like its forebears, it is a quadruped and able to move with both stealth through the undergrowth and with frightening speed across open ground. Its disproportionately elongated skull has multiple rows of fangs designed to latch onto, then worry and rend away at its prey. Its body is lean but highly muscled and no larger than many of the felids kept by many nobles as pets and guard animals.

# **Saurian Carnosaur**

Giant reptiles and similar creatures, often classified under the name "saurian" by the Magos Biologis, are a relatively common form of life throughout the galaxy, often comprising the primary predatory species on many worlds. Sometimes farmed for meat, but more often aggressively hunted on colony worlds, large saurians remain a favourite of the Imperial fighting pits that operate on many worlds.

# FROM BEYOND

Being a treatise on the manifold terrors of the warp and its foul denizens. Whilst to the average citizen, the terrors of the Ruinous Powers and their minions are little more than myth, those of the innermost ranks of the Inquisition know all too well the true nature of the ultimate threats to mankind's future. B

# **Astral Spectre**

Spectres are powerful entities composed of congealed psychic energy and warp-stuff. When manifest in the physical world, they take the shape of incorporeal spectres: patches of moving darkness, unnatural mists boiling with flickering images, halftransparent figures that cast no shadow and a host of other forms.

​￼# Ideas for Follow-Up Adventures **IDEAS FOR FOLLOW-UP ADVENTURES**

Whilst the Acolytes have, hopefully, dealt with the immediate threat posed by Aristarchus and Tsyiak, the work of the Inquisition never ceases. Corruption, deceit and heresy are always lurking, ever present, in the dark and grim world of *Warhammer 40,000*. What follows are some possible plot threads for followup adventures for you, the GM, to work up into full adventures.

​￼# **Xenos Technology**

Aristarchus' Emperor's Tarot deck was exposed as being constructed with xenos technology, but where did it come from? The investigation into the source of the illegal technology continues in *Rejoice For You Are True* found in the Dark Heresy adventure anthology *Purge the Unclean*.

​￼# **The Dancer at the Threshold**

Tsyiak is defeated but undeterred. The Daemon has yet again tasted the pleasures of realspace only to be cast back into the warp, serving to further fuel its anger and desire for revenge. The Dancer at the Threshold has a keen eye and will quietly search for a dark corner within one of the Acolytes' minds in which it can sow the seeds of corruption and downfall. Perhaps Tsyiak could become a major villain in your ongoing campaign of adventures, littering future missions with traps, deceit and murderous intent for the Acolytes to stumble upon. Over the course of time, disparate clues and encounters lead the Acolytes to realise that some unseen Daemonic hand is guiding their path into damnation, only to discover at the last that it has been their old enemy the Crow Father!

​￼# **Heresy Begets Retribution**

After undergoing contamination testing at Bastion Serpentis, the Acolytes are (hopefully) declared free of warp taint. The Inquisition is uncertain that the situation is so crystal clear back on Iocanthos and the Acolytes are tasked with returning to Stern Hope to determine if any of the populace was infected by the Daemonic incursion brought about by Abbot Skae. In the time since the Acolytes were last there, Seth the Voice has been waging a war against Warchief Kos'ke and the other leaders of the Ashleen. Amid this ongoing slaughter, the Acolytes arrive and are courted by both sides eager to have the favour of the agents of the Imperium. Is this just another tribal war like countless others on Iocanthos? Or is the unseen hand of Tsyiak guiding events, drawing the Acolytes back to Stern Hope and the revenge of the Dancer at the Threshold?

​￼# **Undercover**

As the time approaches for the next tithe of Ghostfire pollen to be collected, evidence of sabotage in and around Port Suffering comes to light. Port workers, tired of low-pay and harsh working conditions, murmur of rebellion. Bodies of murdered workers begin to appear, each choked to death by massive amounts of the pollen forced down their throats. Who is inciting rebellion and unrest in Port Suffering? Who is threatening the security of the port and the flow of the precious Ghostfire pollen? The Acolytes are sent in undercover, posing as workers themselves, to investigate the port worker guilds in order to seek out the root of the rebellious behaviour. They must discover who's committing the murders and put a stop to it all before the situation descends into a full-scale uprising and mutinous riot. Is this simply a case of defiance or does something corrupt and evil lurk in the shadows of Port Suffering?
†**Daemonic Presence:** Living creatures within 25 metres of an Astral Spectre feel chilled and unsettled. Shadows become unnaturally deep, and people may hear voices and glimpse eeting echoes of past events. Animals become restless and prone to panic, and machines suffer random glitches and breakdowns. All creatures take a –10 penalty to Willpower Tests.

**Threat Rating:** Malleus Minoris.

# **Charnel Daemon**

Accounts of encounters with the entity known as the Charnel Daemon are some of the most horrific records held by the Ordos Calixis. Powerful and singularly murderous, in order to gain a foothold in our reality, the Charnel Daemon must be summoned by extraordinarily bloody rituals performed by a powerful cult magus. Once manifested, it is in the form of an uncontrollable berserker, that will seek slaughter without end, working to remake the world in an image more pleasing to the Blood God.

‡**Fuelled By Slaughter:** Every time the Charnel Daemon kills a living creature, it heals 1d10 points of Damage. **Weapons:** Teeth and claws (1d10+10 R; Pen 3, Tearing). **Threat Rating:** Malleus Majoris.

# **Incarnate Lesser Daemon**

The shapes and blasphemous hungers that a Daemon might exhibit are without number, and literally thousands of different manifestations are recorded within the restricted archives of the Ordo Malleus. Many reflect the nature and drives of their patrons among the powers of Chaos, acting as foot soldiers in the legions of hell, while others represent the congealed stuff of mankind's worst fears and hidden evils. Regardless of their shape, incarnate Daemons are formed from the pure substance of the warp and cannot maintain their grip on our universe without the aid of bloodshed, misery and death.

# **Dispayres**

Famished and tattered figures with hollow eye-sockets and mouths frozen in endless silent screams, these Daemons serve no single great power; they desire only to bring sorrow and madness. Darkness clings about them, and they make formidable stalkers and assassins for malefic cults.

# **PsYchNeueIN—the mara straIN**

Thankfully rare, Psychneuein are vile warp entities drawn to the mental emanations of unprotected, badly injured or nascent psykers whose minds they attack for the obscene purpose of gestating their progeny. Psychneuein have been known to evidence various distinct genus, of which the Mara Strain is deemed among the most dangerous.

### **The Mara Strain**

The Mara Strain was first identified by Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Ark-Ashtyn during a heavy infestation at the mining penitentiary on the ice-world of Mara in the Calixis Sector, three centuries ago. Although the Mara facility was subsequently decommissioned, the tale of the "ice station massacre" remains a favourite dark fable among the sector's spacefarers. Since then, confirmed incidents of Mara infection have occurred on the sector worlds of Dusk, Lachrymae and Pellucida V as well as several vessels transiting near Mara, although these incidences remain thankfully very few.

#### **The Infested—Final Stage Mania**

The victim can be any creature with a Psy Rating of 1 or more. Apply all of the following modifications:

- Halve Intelligence and Fellowship Characteristics
- Increase Psy Rating by 1.
- Gain Corpus Conversion, Die Hard, Fearless talents.
- Gain immunity to Stun.
- • Creatures that attempt to establish any form of telepathic contact with the infected creature suffer a psychic backlash and takes a level of Fatigue.

• If the infected creature attempts a Psychic Power that results in Perils of the Warp, instead of rolling to see what happens, 1d10 adult psychneuein are born, killing the host in the process.

• If the psyker is slain, there is a 25% chance of 1d10 adult Psychneuein appearing. Otherwise, 1d10 larvae erupt instead.

# **Plaguebearers**

Bloated and malformed, clutching rusted butcher blades and glaring out with a single milky-white eye, these foulest of Daemons are walking incubators of the most terrible diseases and excrescence, serving Nurgle, Chaos power of decay and contagion.

# **Unclean Spirit**

The warp is a place of myriad horrors and numberless dangers, and the entities that seethe and boil within its turbulent depths range from the vast powers of the so-called Chaos gods to mindless, verminous predators. The Ordo Malleus classifies some in this latter category as unclean spirits, and while they lack the reality-damaging powers of true Daemons, they can still prove dangerous if loosed on the world.

**Threat Rating:** Malleus Minima.

# **DAEMONHOSTS** Daemonhosts

Daemonhosts are unholy creations of foul and dangerous rituals in which a powerful Daemon is bound into a living human host body and enslaved to its creator's will. An utterly foul act, the creation of a Daemonhost condemns the soul of the host body to eternal torment and provides a lasting home in the universe for a Daemon to work its evil. Despite the horror of their creation, there are those within the Inquisition itself, it is said, who have dared to replicate the act, hoping to turn their creations against enemies of the Imperium. Unfortunately, Daemonhosts are not only the preserve of a handful of Radical Inquisitors. Insane dabblers in proscribed knowledge and the most powerful of cults have also been known to create Daemonhosts to serve them in their designs. Daemons do not rest easily under the will of any mortal, and to earn the enmity of such a creature is to gain an immortal enemy, so a Daemonhost's creator is faced with a dangerous conundrum: the more powerful the Daemonhost created, the weaker the bindings of the Daemon.

### **Daemonhost Generator**

The generator included here is intended to give you a quick way of creating these most potent opponents, or even allies, of the Inquisition, while also giving you ideas to customize your own Daemonhosts.

#### **The Method**

Creating a Daemonhost has seven stages as detailed below:

**Stage One:** Roll on **Table 12-5: Binding** to determine how many times the Daemonhost has been bound. **Stage Two:** Generate the Daemonhost's Characteristics. **Stage Three:** Generate the changes wrought on the host body. **Stage Four:** Generate the phenomena of the Daemonhost's presence.

**Stage Five:** Generate the Daemonhost's Psychic Powers. **Stage Six:** Determine Skills and Traits.

**Stage Seven:** Add your own finishing touches.

#### **Stage One: Binding**

The less strongly bound a Daemonhost is, the more powerful it will be; but the weaker the binding, the greater the chance the Daemon has to slip its master's control.

### Table 12-5: Binding

#### **Roll Effect**

- 01–10 **Unbound:** The Daemon, within its host, has broken free of its fetters. Such a creature is the walking embodiment of the corrupting power of the warp.
- 11–40 **Once-bound:** A Daemonhost that has the least number of bindings placed on it is apocalyptically powerful, but only barely contained.
- 41–70 **Twice-bound**: More powerfully bound, a Daemonhost is still extremely dangerous, but its raw power is tempered and more easily controlled.
- 71–00 **Thrice-bound:** The most strongly bound Daemonhosts are the least likely to rebel, but are still not without inhuman strength and power.

# **Stage Two: Characteristics**

Once you have determined the extent of the Daemonhost's binding, cross-reference this with the profile given in the following table to give the Daemonhost's Characteristics.

| Table 12-6: Daemonhost Characteristics |         |            |             |              |

| Psy Rating                             | 8       | 6          | 5           | 4            |

# **Stage Three: Unholy Changes**

Daemonhosts are covered with chains and amulets, their skin punctured by needles and their flesh etched with sigils. The host body beneath the bindings is warped by the terrible essence trapped within it. To determine what changes have been visited on the Daemon's fleshy prison, roll on **Table 12-7: Unholy Changes** that follows.

For unbound Daemonhosts, roll 1d5+1 times; for once-bound, roll 1d5; for twice-bound, roll 1d5–1 (minimum once); and for thrice-bound, roll 1d5–2 (minimum once). In all cases, re-roll duplicate results.

|       | Table 12-7: Unholy Changes                                                                                                                     |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 01–04 | Vestigial Horns: Two small horns project from the Daemonhost's forehead.                                                                       |
| 05–08 | Glowing Eyes: The Daemonhost's eyes glow with a malign light.                                                                                  |
| 09–12 | Boils: The flesh of the Daemonhost is covered with weeping boils and sores.                                                                    |
| 13–16 | Cat's Eyes: The Daemonhost's eyes are yellow and the pupils are black slits.                                                                   |

|       | Natural Weapon (Claws) trait with the Warp Weapon quality.                                                                                     |
| 25–28 | Broken Form: The Daemonhost's body is permanently contorted, its body folded in unnatural ways.                                                |
| 29–32 | Snake Tongue: A long forked tongue flicks from between the Daemonhost's teeth.                                                                 |
| 33–36 | Fluid Form: The Daemonhost's flesh flows continually: limbs, screaming faces and other terrible things pushing out from its body before        |
|       | being reabsorbed.                                                                                                                              |

| 41–44 | Bleeding Mouth and Eyes: The Daemonhost's eyes continually weep blood, while viscous gore seeps from between its lips.                         |

| 57–60 | Inner Fire: An unearthly fire burns within the Daemonhost, glowing through its flesh, veins and skin. Its natural attacks inflict Energy       |
|       | Damage.                                                                                                                                        |
| 61–64 | Bloated Form: The host body is grossly bloated.                                                                                                |
| 65–68 | Snake Nest: Snakes coil around the Daemonhost, flowing from its mouth and rents in its flesh. Whenever it deals Damage, the target must        |
|       | succeed on a Hard (-20) Toughness Test or be affected as if by a hallucinogen grenade for 1d5 Rounds.                                          |
| 69–72 | Insect Hive: The Daemonhost's body is a hive for a mass of insects that crawl across it. It gains 1d10 Wounds.                                 |

| 89–92 | Featureless Face: Though it has no effect on its senses, the Daemonhost's head is smooth, featureless flesh.                                   |
| 93–96 | Charred Form: The host body appears horrifically burnt. The Daemonhost is immune to all forms of fire and heat damage, even psychic            |
|       | fire (but not holy flame).                                                                                                                     |
| 97–00 | Seeming Normality: If you roll this result, do not roll any further on this table. Also, any results already rolled are removed. The host body |

### **Stage Four: Daemonic Presence**

The very presence of a Daemonhost has an effect on its surroundings. The diameter of this area is equal to the Daemon's Willpower Characteristic in metres. Within this area, all characters experience a particular set of phenomena and take a -10 penalty to Willpower Tests. The number of phenomena caused depends on how strongly the Daemonhost is bound: unbound Daemonhosts cause four phenomena; once-bound Daemonhosts cause three phenomena; twice-bound Daemonhosts cause two phenomena; and thrice-bound Daemonhosts cause one phenomenon. For each phenomenon the Daemonhost has, roll once on **Table 12-8: Daemonic Phenomena** that follows. Re-roll any duplicate rolls.

|       | Table 12-8: Daemonic Phenomena                                                                                    |  |  |  |

# **HEDRODAL**

### **Twice-bound Daemonhost**

Created by the false prophets of the Pilgrims of Hayte using the unwilling body of the fallen Interrogator Cripon, Hedrodal is a foul thing. A long purple snaketongue flicks from between its grinning teeth, glowing eyes burn with an icy light and its chain-crossed flesh is covered in rolling eyes and glistening boils. Everywhere Hedrodal passes there is the sound of nameless things scuttling, and lurking shadows of horrible visage can be seen inhabiting the darkness around it.
