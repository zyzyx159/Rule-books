# Chapter XII: Aliens & Witches Traits

A *"It is our destiny to rule the universe just as it is the destiny of the xeno to pave our way."*

— Lucretius VII, Inquisitor.

Arrayed against the Acolytes is a galaxy of adversaries, ranging from mortal foes to the most hideous horrors imaginable, each struggling to claw their way out from the warp and visit pain and incalculable suffering on those they encounter. Whilst Dark Heresy is a game of investigation, suspense and fearsome environments, it is also a game set in a universe overwhelmed with conflict and war. Thus, it stands to reason that over the course of a character's career, he will undoubtedly face a veritable army of foes.

# TRAITS

Skills and Talents represent ability and knowledge gained over the course of a character's life. Traits, then, are innate abilities gained by virtue of birth and racial circumstance. They may be gained through other means later in life, but they are almost never gained through choice. As indicated in **Chapter I: Character Creation**, Player Characters acquire certain Traits as a result of their birth world, their destiny as revealed to them by their Imperial Divination, and later as they acquire madness, corruption and potentially mutations. Other characters in the universe of Dark Heresy have Traits too, features inherited from their particular type of species or their environment. S

# **TRAIT DESCRIPTIONS**

# **Amorphous**

An amorphous creature has a malleable form, capable of squeezing its body or expanding it. It can change Size by one step in either direction, though doing so does not change its speed. Creatures with this Trait determine their movement rates using half their Agility Bonus. Amorphous creatures are often missing senses and so rely on the Unnatural Senses trait to perceive their surroundings.

# **armor Plating**

The creature is encased in armor plating, increasing its armor Points by 2 to all locations.

# **Auto-stabilised**

The creature always counts as braced when firing heavy weapons and may fire on semi- or full-automatic as a Half Action.

# **Bestial**

A creature with this Trait is animalistic, tending to behave instinctively rather than rationally. No matter how high its Intelligence score is, it is still bestial. A creature with this Trait never needs to make a Survival Test whilst in its natural habitat. Unless starving or desperate, a bestial creature must make a Willpower Test when frightened, startled or injured. On a failed Test, the creature flees.

# **Blind**

Blind creatures automatically fail all Tests based on vision and automatically fail all Ballistic Skill Tests. Such creatures take a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and most other Tests that ordinarily involve or are benefited by vision.

# **Brutal Charge**

A creature with this Trait deals an extra 3 points of Damage when it charges in the same Round.

# **Burrower**

A creature with this Trait can move through solid objects by burrowing through them. This Trait always includes a number to indicate speed. Such creatures can burrow through soil, rock, sand and so on, and some (expressed in the creature entry) can burrow through metal. When a creature burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel. Creatures of one size smaller than the creature that created the tunnel can enter these areas without impediment. There's a 50% chance each Round that the tunnel collapses behind the creature.

# **Crawler**

Worms, serpents and similar creatures crawl and slither rather than walk. The move for a creature with this Trait is half its Agility Bonus, but it does not take penalties for moving over Difficult Terrain.

# **Daemonic**

Daemonic creatures are creatures of the warp, but can manifest in realspace either through sheer strength of will, hunger or occult rituals. Creatures with this Trait double their Toughness Bonus against all Damage, except for Damage inflicted by force weapons, Psychic Powers, holy attacks or other creatures with this Trait. Daemonic creatures are also immune to poison and disease.

# **Dark Sight**

A creature with this Trait sees normally even in areas of total darkness and never takes a penalty for fighting in areas of dim or no lighting.

# **Incorporeal**

Incorporeal creatures are insubstantial and weightless, able to pass through solid objects such as walls and weapons. An incorporeal creature gains a +30 bonus on Concealment Tests when hiding inside something. If it so wishes, it may become completely silent, automatically passing any Silent Move Tests that it is required to make.

An incorporeal creature is also immune to normal weapons they simply pass through its body as if it wasn't there. Daemons, Psychic Powers, warp creatures, other incorporeal creatures and opponents armed with force weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An incorporeal creature can't normally affect the mortal world and thus can't damage nonincorporeal opponents unless it has a suitable special ability or Talent. Creatures with the Incorporeal trait can Damage other creatures with the Incorporeal trait normally.

Certain devices can keep an incorporeal creature at bay, most notably the Geller field of a spaceship. Creatures with this Trait cannot pass through such a field.

# **Fear (variable)**

A creature with this Trait has an unnerving appearance. Its Fear Rating (1–4) reflects just how awful the creature is to behold. The higher the Fear Rating the harder it is for others to resist going insane from the encounter, as shown on the following chart.

| Fear Rating | Description | Penalty |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 1           | Disturbing  | 0       |
| 2           | Frightening | -10     |
| 3           | Horrifying  | -20     |
| 4           | Terrifying  | -30     |

When a character encounters a creature with this Trait, he must make a Willpower Test, modified by the severity of the creature's Trait. On a success, the character may act as normal. On a failure, the character must roll on **Table 8-4: The Shock Table** on **[page 233](#page-233-0)**, adding

# **Threat Rating**

All the creatures and Dramatis Personae in Dark Heresy have a threat rating in their description based on the classifications used by the Ordos Calixis. The threat rating is divided into two; the first part of which designates the nature of the threat posed, and the second being the degree of threat posed to the Imperium.

### **Threat Designation**

**Hereticus:** The threat comes from within humanity, such as heretical thought, criminality, rebellion, rogue mutants, witches and the like.

**Xenos:** The threat comes from a species other than mankind; be it the alien itself or a product of the alien's blasphemous nature, influence or technology.

**Malleus:** The threat comes from the warp, and is either a being born of that infernal realm or is infused by its power.

**Obscuro:** The nature of the threat is either unknown, resists analysis or it falls outside the normal categories of danger. This threat classification is also in rare circumstances applied to forbidden dangers of mankind's own forgotten antiquity.

# **Grade of Threat**

**Minima:** In small numbers the threat is minimal and only likely to affect isolated or weak individuals. Still potentially dangerous to the unprepared or inexperienced Imperial servant.

**Minoris:** In numbers the threat can pose a severe threat to those who confront it. However, unless encountered in large numbers or allied to greater forces, it is unlikely to pose a threat to the Imperium's control over a particular world or the local dominion of the God Emperor.

**Majoris:** Constitutes a considerable physical or moral threat to a civilian population, hazardous to Imperial agents and in large numbers the threat would require specialised or mass forces to neutralise. Containment of such threats, especially the prevention of widespread knowledge or contact with them by the civilian population, is considered crucial.

**Extremis:** The threat poses a lethal threat to those who encounter it and is by its very nature or power enough to require the most powerful of responses. Such threats endanger the safety of whole worlds if left unchecked, and, if not locally confined, can have wider implications for the dominion of the God Emperor.

**Terminus:** The level of threat posed is such that almost any deployment of forces to combat it is likely to result in serious loss. Such a threat can only be eliminated with extreme prejudice, and if widespread, entrenched or accelerating in severity, then the consideration must be given to the use of the most exceptional measures.

+10 to the roll for every degree of failure by which the Willpower Test failed. The results of this roll have variable effects, but generally leave the character a gibbering mess. For more details on the effects of Fear and Insanity, see **Chapter VIII: The Game Master**.

# **Flyer**

A creature with this Trait has the natural ability to fly, whether with broad leathery wings, strange warp energies or inflatable gas sacs. This Trait always includes a number to indicate at what speeds it moves when it flies. For more details on flying, see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**.

# **From Beyond**

The mind of a creature with this Trait is beyond the petty frailties and precarious sanity of a mortal mind. It is immune to Fear, Pinning, Insanity Points and Psychic Powers used to cloud, control or delude its mind.

# **Hoverer**

Creatures with this Trait have a limited capability for flight, flying no higher than two metres. As with the Flyer trait, this Trait always includes a number to indicate speed. For more details on flying, see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**.

# **Machine**

A creature with the Machine trait is fashioned from inorganic materials and is generally more rigorous than fleshy folks. Machines do not breathe, are immune to the effects of a vacuum, extremes of cold and any mind-influencing psychic effect. Their armor Points apply towards fire Damage. Machines are also resilient to injury, having 1 to 5 armor Points for each location. This number is indicated next to the Trait.

# **MultipleArms**

This creature has more than one pair of arms. It increases its Toughness Characteristic by +10 and gains a +10 bonus on Strength Tests involving movement such as Climb and Swim. Finally, the creature may use the Multiple Attack Action to gain two attacks on its Turn.

# **Naturalarmor**

This creature has a naturally tough hide or an exoskeleton, affording it some protection against attacks. This Trait always includes a numeric value to indicate how many armor Points the creature gains to all locations.

# **Natural Weapons**

This creature has sharp claws, teeth, spines or some other natural weapon with which it can slice and dice its foes. It counts as being armed even when not wielding weapons. Its attacks deal 1d10 points of Damage plus its Strength Bonus. The creature may make attacks with its Natural Weapons using its Weapon Skill, though it cannot Parry with its natural weapons, nor can it be disarmed—unless, of course, you hack off its limbs! Natural weapons always count as Primitive.

# **Phase**

A creature with this Trait can transform its body into an insubstantial state, passing ghost-like through solid objects or barriers of any sort. This Trait functions exactly like the Incorporeal trait, except the creature may become solid or insubstantial by spending a Half Action.

Phase carries additional limitations. A creature in a phased state cannot cross psychically charged barriers, holy wards, or energy fields designed to flux space or manipulate the warp such as a Geller field or a void shield.

# **Possession**

Certain spirit-beings and denizens of the warp have the ability to possess mortal bodies. This is a far more insidious and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or even the power of the strongest psykers to "ware" the bodies of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is merged with the victim's living body on a fundamental level so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below, although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may vary. Note that Daemonhosts, being extraordinary powerful examples of deliberate, ritualistic possessions, designed to bind and control Daemons in living vessels, are a special case and dealt with separately.

# **The Possession Attack**

The entity must be within a few metres of its intended victim and use a Full Action. The creature and target make Opposed Willpower Tests each Round until either the entity or the victim achieve a total of five degrees of success over the other—this is cumulative over several Rounds. If the entity wins, it successfully possesses its victim. If its victim wins, he has repelled the entity who may not attempt to possess him again for 24 hours. A repelled entity also takes 1d10 points of Damage.

# **The Effects of Possession**

A possessing entity takes control utterly, binding itself to its victim, and is capable of commanding the body to function regardless of pain and injury (and indeed might delight in damaging or altering it to suit its whims). The victim increases his Strength and Toughness Characteristics by 10 and gains 1d10 Wounds. The victim uses the possessing entity's Intelligence, Perception, Willpower and Fellowship, and uses the entity's Psy Rating and Psychic Powers in place of its own (if any). Likewise, the possessed creature uses any mind-related Skills and Talents had by the entity and loses its own.

The entity may also attempt to recall memories and skills from its victim with a successful Intelligence Test. In the case of possession by a Daemon, the victim has a good chance of becoming immediately mutated and likely to become further mutated the longer the possession continues.

# **Surviving Possession**

Should the victim survive and the entity is cast out by exorcism or some other means, then the ordeal reduces the character's Toughness and Willpower Characteristics by 2d10 permanently. In addition, the victim gains 1d10 Insanity Points.

# **Quadruped**

Quadrupeds are much quicker over a distance than their bipedal counterparts. To calculate their movement, double their Agility Bonus. This Trait is intended to cover creatures with hind legs and forepaws. Creatures with more than four legs may gain this Trait but they increase the Agility Bonus by 1 multiplier for every extra set of legs (six legs equals AB×3, eight legs AB×4 and so on).

# **Regeneration**

Creatures with this Trait heal very quickly. Each Round, at the start of its Turn, the creature Tests Toughness to remove 1 point of Damage. It loses this Trait when slain.

# **Size**

# **Trait Groups: Minuscule, Puny, Scrawny, Hulking, Enormous, Massive**

Creatures come in one of seven different size categories, as shown on the following chart. Size affects movement and how easy or hard it is to strike that creature in combat. (When calculating movement, apply the size modifier first, and then other modifiers from other Traits or Talents.) For the purposes of comparison, a human is an average-sized creature.

| Table 12–2: Creature Size Modifiers |          |             |               |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-------------|---------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Size                                | Modifier | Concealment | Base Movement |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Minuscule                           | –30      | +30         | AB–3          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Puny                                | –20      | +20         | AB–2          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Scrawny                             | –10      | +10         | AB–1          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Average                             | 0        | 0           | AB            |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Hulking                             | +10      | –10         | AB+1          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Enormous                            | +20      | –20         | AB+2          |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Massive                             | +30      | –30         | AB+3          |  |  |  |  |  |  |

# **Sonar Sense**

A creature with this Trait perceives its surroundings by emitting a frequency noise, allowing the creature to locate the position of any solid object within 30 metres. Other creatures within range, and that succeed on a Difficult (–10) Awareness Test, may detect the curious keening.

# **Soul-bound**

The soul of this creature is bound to a higher purpose or being, in return for a measure of protection. When this Trait is first gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially astropaths, are soul-bound to the Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos sorcerers may be bound to one of the Ruinous Powers. A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional d10 when forced to roll on **Table 6-3: Perils of the Warp** on **[page 163](#page-163-0)**, discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result.

Upon becoming soul-bound, a character must choose one of the following effects: 1d10 Insanity Points, the permanent loss of sight, the permanent loss of 1d10 from one Characteristic or a random mutation (only if soul-bound to the Ruinous Powers).

In addition, a soul-bound character is permanently indebted to the entity, which undoubtedly entails all manner of other duties and consequences.

# **Stampede**

Whenever a creature with this Trait fails a Willpower Test, it automatically stampedes, charging in a straight line forwards as far as possible, overrunning anything in its path until the source of danger is escaped or crushed under hoof, taking Damage equal to the creature's Natural Weapon Damage (or 1d5+SB I if it doesn't have one). One stampeding creature automatically causes all other creatures within sight to stampede. The stampede lasts until the source of danger is no longer visible or for 1d10 minutes, whichever occurs last.

# **Strange Physiology**

A creature with this Trait has an unusual, alien, or altogether bizarre anatomy. All hits count as Body hits and death results when Damage equals or exceeds the creature's Wounds.

# **The Stuff of Nightmares**

Some warp entities are so terribly powerful that their will perpetuating their bodies in our reality is almost impossible to break or disrupt. Such entities are completely immune to the effects of poisons, diseases, the need to breathe, most environmental hazards, Blood Loss, Stunning and any Critical result other than one that would destroy them outright, unless caused by a Psychic Power, force weapon or holy attack.

# **Sturdy**

Sturdy creatures are hard to move and thus gain a +20 bonus to Tests made to resist Grappling and uses of the Takedown talent.

# **Toxic**

A creature with this Trait is poisonous. The toxins might be delivered through the creature's attacks, in which case a target hit by its natural weapons must make a Toughness Test. The toxins might instead be delivered by contact with the creature's skin or by inhaling its stench, in which case a Toughness Test must be made upon coming into contact or proximity. A failed Toughness Test indicates that the victim has been poisoned. A typical poison deals 1d10 points of Damage, ignoring armor Points. Variations, if present, are included in the creature's description.

# **Unnatural Characteristic**

One or more of the creature's Characteristics is unnatural. Each time this Trait is gained, select a Characteristic and double its bonus. For example, *a creature with a Strength of 41 normally has a 4 Strength Bonus. With this Trait, its Strength Bonus increases to 8*.

The Trait may be gained multiple times. Each time, you may select a new Characteristic or one chosen previously. Each time you apply this Trait to the same Characteristic, the Bonus multiplier increases by 1. For example, *one selection multiplies the Characteristic Bonus by ×2, two selections by ×3, and three selections ×4. Note that this Trait does not modify the creature's movement.*

Applying this Trait to Agility does not increase a creature's movement. Movement is based on a creature's unmodified Agility Bonus.

During Opposed Characteristic Tests, on a success the bonus multiplier is added to the degree of success. For example, *Gybalt (S32) is trying to break free of the grip of a Daemon (S35, Unnatural Strength (*×*2)). This is an Opposed Strength Test with Gybalt rolling* 

*12 (2 degrees of success) versus the Daemon's roll of 15 (2 degrees of success plus 2 from the Unnatural Strength, a total of 4 degrees of success). Gybalt fails to shake off the Daemon.*

# **Unnatural Senses**

The creature can perceive its surroundings using senses other than sight or hearing, using special organs, fine hairs or some other disturbing quality to make itself aware of what's around it. This Trait always includes a range, usually 15 metres.

# **Unnatural Speed**

The creature moves with incredible speed. For the purposes of determining movement, the creature doubles its Agility Bonus (after modifying AB from other Traits and factors, specifically size).

# **Warp Instability**

Most warp entities have a tenuous hold on our reality, often maintained only by horror and bloodshed, and may be disrupted if sufficient harm can be done to their manifested forms. If a creature with this Trait takes Damage and does not deal Damage or Insanity Points on other creatures by the end of its next Turn, it must make a Willpower Test. The creature takes 1 Damage for failure, plus 1 Damage for each degree of failure. If this would deal Damage equal to or in excess of the creature's Wounds, it is cast back into the warp.

# **Warp Weapon**

Creatures with this Trait have weapons that are partially insubstantial, able to ignore such mundane things as armor or cover. Natural weapons and attacks made by a creature with this Trait ignore physical armor unless it is created from psychoactive materials or carries the holy quality. Force fields still work against these attacks normally.

# MUTATIONS

One of the most pervasive signs of corruption in the Imperium is the manifestation of mutations. These subtle, or not-so-subtle, changes in the flesh can result from exposure to toxic pollutants, alien biospheres, genetic engineering, radiation and other hazards, while others might result from exposure to the warp, Daemonic possession and other perils of the universe. The level of tolerance for mutants varies planet to planet. Subtle or cosmetic changes are accepted, and such beings are regarded as abhumans or subs, who in some worlds form an oppressed and exploited underclass. Truly horrific mutants are purged on sight wherever they are found.

# **GAINING MUTATIONS**

Characters, creatures and so on, acquire mutations in a variety of ways, but the most common cause is through physical corruption. Warped environments, chemicals, illegal drugs and so on, can all result in mutation and there are few safeguards to prevent a mutation once it takes root. Mutations function as Traits, meaning that characters cannot purchase them with Experience Points.

# **Mutation**

Whenever a mutation occurs, roll either for a Minor Mutation on **Table 12-3: Minor Mutations,** or Major Mutations on **Table 12-4: Major Mutations** to discover what type of mutation is gained. Always re-roll duplicate results.

# Table 12-3: Minor Mutations

### **Roll D100 Effect**

| 01–20 | Grotesque: The mutant is either badly deformed, scarred or bestial, marking it as accursed and impure, Fellowship Tests with 'normals' are made at –20, but the mutant has a +10 bonus to Intimidate Tests.                  |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 21–30 | Tough Hide: The mutant has 1 AP worth of Natural armor thanks to dense skin and scar tissue.                                                                                                                                 |
| 31–40 | Misshapen: The mutant's spine and/or limbs are horribly twisted, giving it a penalty of –1d10 to its Agility.                                                                                                                |

| 81–85 | Malformed hands: Apply –10 to WS and BS and the mutant suffers a –20 penalty to all tasks involving fine physical manipulation.                                                                                              |

# Table 12-4: Major Mutations

**Roll D100 Effect**

01–25 **Vile Deformity:** The mutant is marked by some terrible deformity that shows the touch of the warp and should not exist in a rational universe. There is no end to the dire forms this might take such as writhing tentacles in place of arms, skinless glistening flesh, re-arranged facial features or thousands of restless eyes studding the body, to name but a few. The mutant gains the Disturbing trait.

26–35 **Aberration:** The mutant has become a weird hybrid of man and animal (or reptile, insect, etc.) Apply +10 Strength, +10 Agility, –1d10 Intelligence, -10 Fellowship and the Sprint talent.

- 36–40 **Degenerate Mind:** The mutant's mind is warped and inhuman. Apply –1d10 Intelligence, +10 Fellowship, roll 1d10 and apply the following Talents or Trait: **1–3:** Frenzy, **4–7:** Fearless, **8–0:** From Beyond.
- 41–50 **Ravaged Body:** The mutant's body has been entirely re-made by the warp. Roll 1d5 times on **Table 12-3: Minor Mutations**, re-rolling duplicate rolls. Such mutations, regardless of their nature, still show the obvious taint of Chaos.
- 51–60 **Clawed/Fanged:** The mutant gains razor claws, a fanged maw, barbed flesh or some other form of Natural Weapon that inflicts 1d10 R or I Primitive damage in close combat.
- 61–65 **Necrophage:** The mutant gains +10 Toughness and the Regeneration trait, but must sustain itself on copious quantities of raw meat or starve.
- 66–70 **Corrupted Flesh:** Beneath the mutants' skin a blasphemous transformation has taken place, exchanging living organs for writhing creatures and blood for ichorous, maggot-ridden filth. If the mutant suffers Critical Damage, those witnessing it must take a Fear Test at –10.
- 71–75 **Vile Alacrity:** The mutant is constantly juddering and shaking unnaturally and can move almost faster than sight. It gains the Unnatural Agility (x2) trait and the Sprint talent, with a penalty of –10 to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill.
- 76–80 **Hideous Strength:** The mutant gains the Unnatural Strength (x2) trait.
- 81–85 **Multiple Appendages:** The mutant has sprouted additional functioning limbs in the shape of arms, tentacles or a prehensile tail (or tails). Gain the Ambidextrous and Two-Weapon Wielder talents and +10 bonus on Climb Tests and Grapple attacks.
- 86–90 **Worm:** The mutant's lower limbs have fused together to form a worm or snake-like tail. They gain the Crawler trait, +5 Wounds and the Disturbing trait.
- 91–92 **Nightmarish:** So warped and horrific is the mutant's appearance, it can cause enemies to flee in fear. It gains the Frightening trait.
- 93–94 **Malleable:** The mutant possesses a sickeningly liquid flexibility and is able to distend and flatten its body. Apply +10 Agility and +20 to Climb Tests, and Grappling attacks. They may also fit through spaces only one-quarter its usual body dimensions.
- 95–96 **Winged:** The mutant's body has warped to accommodate a pair of leathery wings or the like. They gain the Flyer trait (1d10+5).
- 97–98 **Corpulent:** The mutant's huge and bloated frame gives them +5 Wounds and the Unnatural Toughness (x2) trait. This mutation means that the mutant may not run.
- 99 **Corrosive Bile:** The mutant may vomit burning bile, flesh-eating grubs or some other horrific substance instead of attacking normally in close combat. The attack uses the mutant's BS, is a Full Action and can be Dodged but not Parried. This attack inflicts 1d10+5 R (or E) Tearing Damage.
- 00 **Hellspawn:** Saturated with the energies of the warp, the mutant is imbued with Daemonic energies and gains the From Beyond, Frightening and Daemonic traits and a Psy Rating of 2.

# **DRAMATIS PERSONAE**

M Most adversaries that Acolytes face are of the mundane sorts, being hardened thugs, twisted mutants, soldiers and political rivals. The following entries describe some common foes that the Player Characters are likely to encounter as they tear back the grim facade and stare deep into the abyss of corruption. Do note that weapons, armor and gear are typical for these characters, but are not necessarily consistent for all such characters. Modify an entry's gear to suit your needs. Also note that in the instance of melee weapon Damage, SB has already been factored in.

# **Arbitrator**

The Adeptus Arbites are the iron fist of Imperial law. Arbitrators are the militant arm of the Imperial judiciary and the first line of defence against heresy and rebellion, empowered in extremis to take control of a world should its ruling bodies fall from grace.

| Arbitrator Profile |    |    |    |    |     |     |    |     |

# **Astropath**

Without the astropaths of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica there would be no Imperium. Every message transmitted between the stars must be passed telepathically between thousands of psykers known as astropaths. Without this living web of communication, mankind's galactic civilisation would be impossible.

# **Bounty Hunter**

The kind of killer skilled enough to hunt down warranted criminals and renegades within an underhive, or even between worlds, is a dangerous individual. Bounty hunters are lethal beyond any mere ganger or scum—often even more so than their quarry.

**Threat Rating:** Hereticus Minoris.

# **Cult Fanatic**

The terrible revelations that involvement in a proscribed cult can bring can break the sanity of the strongest. Such "touched" individuals still remain useful to the cult as guards, lackeys and handy sacrifices.

| Cult Fanatic Profile |    |    |    |    |     |     |    |     |  |  |

# **Cult Initiate**

Like cancer cells in the body of the Imperium, hidden conspiracies, blasphemous religions and forbidden creeds fester and ferment in the shadows, and there is no shortage of hapless souls ready to join their ranks.

# **Cult Magus**

The higher echelons of many cults venerating the Ruinous Powers are peopled with men and woman who have sold their souls in return for occult power.

### **Sorcery!**

Though not a true psyker, a witch can wield the power of the warp through incantation and sorcery. To reflect the eldritch and esoteric methods they employ, all their Psychic Powers need a Full Action to use (regardless of the actual focus time) and their Psychic Powers have a Psychic Threshold of +2. A Cult Magus must be able to speak and gesture freely in order to use Psychic Powers. Also, the practice of the dark arts is far from safe, even compared to the use of a psyker's abilities, and they must add +20 to the results of any Psychic Phenomena and Perils of the Warp rolls that they incur.

# **Dreg**

The lowest of the low, dregs, sometimes known as scavvies or wasters, are addicts, degenerates, outcasts, madmen and worse. Utterly desperate, and often ruined in body and mind, some of them can be far more dangerous than any sane man, and willing to do anything for very little payment at all…

# **Citizen**

The Imperium contains countless billions of men and women, from the hab-workers trudging to and from the manufactora day after day, to the ratings that bloody their feet treading the wheels of magazine hoists on the Emperor's warships, to the ore miners whose short lives feed the Imperium's iron heat.

# **Combat Servitor**

Combat servitors are armed with highly effective combat weaponry and programmed with basic weapon routines to use them.

# **Dissolute Noble**

When the most privileged go bad, they go very bad indeed. With money and influence, a noble can fall into all manner of depravities that are to them no more than mere pastimes to alleviate the boredom of excess.

# **Enforcer**

While the Adeptus Arbites are the vigilant guardians of Imperial law, everyday policing and enforcement of local laws falls to a planet's own security forces. Variously called chasteners, prefects, watchmen or any other number of local titles on different worlds, such security forces are most commonly referred to as enforcers.

# **Entertainer**

Given the often crushing misery of life, it is no surprise that a little escape is often desirable for the masses, and entertainment in the Imperium has a tendency towards the simple, direct and visceral.

**Enforcer**

Across the Imperium, in smelteries and forge factories, huge crucibles pour rivers of white-hot metal into moulds and the air is filled with sparks. Amidst the glow, figures lumber under the weight of vulcanised rubber suits, their eyes hidden behind smoked-glass goggles.

# **Heretek**

Technology is little understood and rightly feared. Hereteks are criminals who specialise in the dark arts of tech-reclamation, science and salvage outside the rightful purview of the Cult Mechanicus, and risk "recycling" into a more productive life as a servitor if the Priesthood of Mars gets hold of them. Some hereteks are little more than scavengers, others are dangerous renegades that supply the underworld with proscribed drugs or arms, and the worst delve into matters best left alone.

**Threat Rating:** Hereticus Minima.

# **Kill Squad Trooper**

Used to enforce execution warrants or when extreme prejudice is required, the kill squads are some of the most dangerous formations that can exist within an enforcer organisation. On some worlds, where the rule of the planetary governor is dictatorial and harsh, kill squads are the hated embodiments of their power.

**Gear:** Uniform, 2 autogun clips, micro-bead, respirator, photovisor.

**Threat Rating:** Hereticus Minoris.

# **Heavy**

Dumb muscle always has a market for hire, and many thugs, cut-throats and brawlers augment their own prowess with crude vat-grown muscle implants, dangerous chemical treatments and brain-damaging combat drugs.

Ministorum Preacher

# **Ministorum Preacher**

To countless billions, the Emperor is nothing less than a god. Over the millennia this faith has created a vast and powerful organisation devoted to His worship; the Ministorum. It is made up of countless ranks and divisions from the deacons, cardinals and high ecclesiarchs that govern the faith to the numberless priests, preachers, mendicants, rectors, psalters, scribes and choristers that make up the body of the priesthood.

**Threat Rating:** Hereticus Minima.

# **Mutant**

Mutation is a sad fact of human existence in the Imperium, and on many worlds the human gene pool has become irrevocably damaged by generations of exposure to pollutants and alien biospheres. Mutants tolerated by the Imperium are generally referred to as abhumans (sometimes even being classified by the Administratum) and often allowed to toil in slave-like conditions in factories and hives.

# **Mutant Abomination**

Worse by far than any tragic unfortunate, born twisted from the effects of pollutants and radiation, is the mutant struck down and remade by the influence of the warp. These are the lost and damned; their bodies have become the clay of an insane and macabre sculptor, and their minds and souls tainted beyond salvation.

# **Rating**

Any large star vessel requires crew in the hundreds, if not thousands. It is dangerous and backbreaking laborious work for the most part, where life expectancy is low and slow death through radiation exposure and pressure-ague commonplace.

# **Recidivist**

Scum they say rises to the surface—and it's true that there are always those skilled, amoral or clever enough to rise to prominence in the underworld. These crime lords, slavers, fencers and fixers can fulfil many different roles, but the Arbites give them a single damning title, recidivists, and they live like parasites on the soft underbelly of the Imperium.

# **Scum**

Life in the Imperium is harsh and unforgiving, and breeds a variety of scum that prefer to prey on the weak and make a living by victimising those even worse off than themselves. This entry is appropriate for any number of low-rent thugs, robbers, racketeers, bagmen and malcontents.

# **Servitor Drone**

Servitors are fusions of flesh and machine made from culture-grown organics or mind-wiped human bodies. Millions of these cyborg creations are found throughout the Imperium and are used to perform monotonous single functions without deviation or question.

# **Skulker**

Some scum prefer thievery, guile and lies to get what they want rather than risk open violence (a bullet in the back is a different matter however). Skulkers often consider themselves a cut above the rest of the underworld, with an arrogant disdain for "dog work".

# **Tech Adept**

The ancient priesthood of Mars, the Adeptus Mechanicus are the only sanctioned repositories of scientific thought and technological lore in the Imperium. Steeped in arcane ritual and labyrinthine dogma, to them their arts are a divine mystery of their incarnation of the Emperor—the Omnissiah, and to them all things technological are sacred.

These are fully initiated acolytes of the Cult Mechanicus and form the bulk of its ordained priesthood.

# **Witch**

Witches are a breed of rogue psykers and mystics who have rejected the Imperium and all it stands for, and embraced the fell powers of Chaos. Madmen, lunatics and vile heretics, they are hunted by Inquisitors and destroyed wherever they are found.

# **Brain Leaf**

Few would believe that of all the enemies faced by mankind, a greyish vine-like plant could pose such an insidious threat. Variously referred to as "slave vine" or "the grey weed", but most commonly the "brain leaf ", this malignant creature was once thought to originate from the jungle death world of Catachan. In physical form, the brain leaf plant resembles a coarse vine or ivy, each tendril of which is tipped with a single fleshy leaf. Uniquely, the brain leaf possesses a form of gestalt consciousness, and each leaf is a macro-cell forming part of its utterly alien intelligence. The underside of each vine leaf is barbed to latch onto creatures straying too close and, once attached to a victim, microscopic fibre bundles penetrate the skin and extrude fibrous growths throughout a victim's nervous system to take control of its body utterly. Though not sentient in any measurable sense, the brain leaf efficiently and swiftly dominates its victim, subverting it to the will of the parent plant. Once this has been accomplished, the leaf detaches from the main body and remains as an attached parasite on the victim, allowing a new leaf to rapidly grow in its place. The victim, now a staggering thrall to the brain leaf plant, is used by the weed to protect itself and proliferate its young.

Infestations of brain leaf have been discovered on many worlds, and recent emergent evidence is that the brain leaf is no true native of Catachan, but likely a rogue mutation and evolutionary descendant of the Tyranid cortex leech, makes the destruction of any infestation a priority for many in the Ordo Xenos Calixis. The horrors visited on members of the sector's nobility during the infamous "Slaughter Gardens of Quaddis" incident several years ago have emphasised the need to prevent the spawning and multiplication of this foul vine.

# **The Brain Leaf Plant**

The vine is most often encountered wrapped parasitically around another large plant or tree, or crawling across the face of some statue or edifice, and varies in size according to maturity. Some of a brain leaf 's Characteristics vary according to how much it has grown and there are three levels of growth listed here: Immature, Mature and Ancient.

| Brain Leaf Plant Profile – Immature |    |   |    |    |     |     |    |     |
|-------------------------------------|----|---|----|----|-----|-----|----|-----|

**Movement:** — **Wounds:** 40

**Traits:** Limited Actions† , Size (Scrawny for immature, Average for mature, Hulking for ancient), Strange Physiology, Taking Control‡ .

† **Limited Actions:** The only Action a brain leaf may perform is an attempt to latch on to a victim within half a metre of one of its leaves.

‡ **Taking Control:** A brain leaf 's victim is nearly always unaware of the danger he is in and has a single chance to feel the prick of the leaf 's barbs, and rip it off before it is too late. A resilient, sealed covering over the victim's head and neck (sufficient to provide 2 AP) can protect against an attack. At the moment that a leaf makes contact, the target must succeed on an Agility Test or the leaf latches on and rapidly begins to subvert the victim's nervous system, causing the victim to fall prone and twitch. It takes 1d10 minutes to infiltrate the victim's nervous system fully and, if the leaf is removed during this time, the victim recovers consciousness but loses 1d10 points permanently from Toughness and gains 1d10 Insanity Points. Unless the process is stopped, after the required time has passed, the victim becomes a Brain Leaf Thrall.

# **Brain Leaf Thrall**

Thralls of the brain leaf are completely under the control of the malign plant, turning them into nerve-damaged, drooling, twitching shamblers. Modify the thrall Characteristics as follows. Where a "—" is listed, it indicates that the creature loses this Characteristic and can no longer take or fail Tests based on it.

| Brain Leaf Thrall Profile Adjustment |     |    |     |     |     |     |    |     |  |
|--------------------------------------|-----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|--|
| WS                                   | BS  | S  | T   | Ag  | Int | Per | WP | Fel |  |
| -10                                  | -10 | +0 | -10 | -10 | –   | -10 | –  | –   |  |

### **Wounds:** Halve.

**Skills, Talents and Powers:** The thrall loses all Skills, Talents and Psychic Powers whilst enthralled. All thralls gain the Fearless talent. They react sluggishly; their only evident behaviour is to stand sentry over their parent plant, hurling themselves spasmodically against anything threatening it.

### **Recovering from Thralldom**

Should the leaf be ripped from a thrall, the thrall mmediately lets out a horrific scream of agony and collapses unconscious, as the severing of the plant's control causes a massive trauma to the victim's nervous system. Once the leaf is removed, a thrall must pass a Toughness Test or die. If he survives he recovers but retains the reduction of Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Toughness, Agility and Perception as permanent Characteristic Damage. The released thrall also gains 3d10 Insanity Points. **Threat Rating:** Xenos Minoris.

# **Dusk Stalker**

A terrifying creature that has become the stuff of dark fable across the Calixis Sector, the stalker is one of the most feared of Dusk's many dangers, haunting the deepest swamps of that world. In appearance, it resembles a frightening hybrid of a withered elderly human and gigantic four-limbed spider.

# **Grox**

The demand for meat and livestock to feed the Imperium's countless mouths is immense, and while dozens of other (and far more palatable) species such as spiralhorns, demi-pach and tusk bison are common, it is the Grox that has become the Imperium's widest used staple.

# **Nightwing**

The ill-famed world of Dusk is known for its many horrific creatures and sinister predators, and the Nightwing is no exception. A nocturnal creature, strange and disturbing to look upon, its amber, slug-like body is the length of a man's arm and nearly featureless but for a small round mouth surrounded by hook-like barbs at one end.

**Traits:** Bestial, Fear 1, Flyer 6, Narcotic Dust† , Natural Weapon (Bite), Sonar Sense, Sucking Bite‡

This is a poisonous attack.

‡**Sucking Bite**: If a Nightwing successfully bites its prey, it automatically latches on and drains its victim's blood. Each Round, the Nightwing deals 1d10 points of Toughness Damage until the victim's Toughness falls to 0, at which point death occurs. In addition, the sucking bite inflicts 1 level of Fatigue per Round. The Nightwing can be removed by winning an Opposed Strength Test. While a Nightwing is attached, all melee attacks against it gain a +20 bonus.

**Weapons:** Bite (1d10+3 R; Primitive). **Threat Rating:** Xenos Minima.

# **Sabre-Wolf**

The Sabre-wolf is a custom-bred apex predator. Created by centuries of cross-breeding mutant creatures and xenos predators, its hunting grounds are the pleasure parks of the Calixis elite and, in some cases, the fighting pits of the less wealthy. Like its forebears, it is a quadruped and able to move with both stealth through the undergrowth and with frightening speed across open ground. Its disproportionately elongated skull has multiple rows of fangs designed to latch onto, then worry and rend away at its prey. Its body is lean but highly muscled and no larger than many of the felids kept by many nobles as pets and guard animals.

# **Saurian Carnosaur**

Giant reptiles and similar creatures, often classified under the name "saurian" by the Magos Biologis, are a relatively common form of life throughout the galaxy, often comprising the primary predatory species on many worlds. Sometimes farmed for meat, but more often aggressively hunted on colony worlds, large saurians remain a favourite of the Imperial fighting pits that operate on many worlds.

# FROM BEYOND

Being a treatise on the manifold terrors of the warp and its foul denizens. Whilst to the average citizen, the terrors of the Ruinous Powers and their minions are little more than myth, those of the innermost ranks of the Inquisition know all too well the true nature of the ultimate threats to mankind's future. B

# **Astral Spectre**

Spectres are powerful entities composed of congealed psychic energy and warp-stuff. When manifest in the physical world, they take the shape of incorporeal spectres: patches of moving darkness, unnatural mists boiling with flickering images, halftransparent figures that cast no shadow and a host of other forms.

# Chapter XIII: Illumination 
​￼# Ideas for Follow-Up Adventures **IDEAS FOR FOLLOW-UP ADVENTURES**

Whilst the Acolytes have, hopefully, dealt with the immediate threat posed by Aristarchus and Tsyiak, the work of the Inquisition never ceases. Corruption, deceit and heresy are always lurking, ever present, in the dark and grim world of *Warhammer 40,000*. What follows are some possible plot threads for followup adventures for you, the GM, to work up into full adventures.

​￼# **Xenos Technology**

Aristarchus' Emperor's Tarot deck was exposed as being constructed with xenos technology, but where did it come from? The investigation into the source of the illegal technology continues in *Rejoice For You Are True* found in the Dark Heresy adventure anthology *Purge the Unclean*.

​￼# **The Dancer at the Threshold**

Tsyiak is defeated but undeterred. The Daemon has yet again tasted the pleasures of realspace only to be cast back into the warp, serving to further fuel its anger and desire for revenge. The Dancer at the Threshold has a keen eye and will quietly search for a dark corner within one of the Acolytes' minds in which it can sow the seeds of corruption and downfall. Perhaps Tsyiak could become a major villain in your ongoing campaign of adventures, littering future missions with traps, deceit and murderous intent for the Acolytes to stumble upon. Over the course of time, disparate clues and encounters lead the Acolytes to realise that some unseen Daemonic hand is guiding their path into damnation, only to discover at the last that it has been their old enemy the Crow Father!

​￼# **Heresy Begets Retribution**

After undergoing contamination testing at Bastion Serpentis, the Acolytes are (hopefully) declared free of warp taint. The Inquisition is uncertain that the situation is so crystal clear back on Iocanthos and the Acolytes are tasked with returning to Stern Hope to determine if any of the populace was infected by the Daemonic incursion brought about by Abbot Skae. In the time since the Acolytes were last there, Seth the Voice has been waging a war against Warchief Kos'ke and the other leaders of the Ashleen. Amid this ongoing slaughter, the Acolytes arrive and are courted by both sides eager to have the favour of the agents of the Imperium. Is this just another tribal war like countless others on Iocanthos? Or is the unseen hand of Tsyiak guiding events, drawing the Acolytes back to Stern Hope and the revenge of the Dancer at the Threshold?

​￼# **Undercover**

As the time approaches for the next tithe of Ghostfire pollen to be collected, evidence of sabotage in and around Port Suffering comes to light. Port workers, tired of low-pay and harsh working conditions, murmur of rebellion. Bodies of murdered workers begin to appear, each choked to death by massive amounts of the pollen forced down their throats. Who is inciting rebellion and unrest in Port Suffering? Who is threatening the security of the port and the flow of the precious Ghostfire pollen? The Acolytes are sent in undercover, posing as workers themselves, to investigate the port worker guilds in order to seek out the root of the rebellious behaviour. They must discover who's committing the murders and put a stop to it all before the situation descends into a full-scale uprising and mutinous riot. Is this simply a case of defiance or does something corrupt and evil lurk in the shadows of Port Suffering?
†**Daemonic Presence:** Living creatures within 25 metres of an Astral Spectre feel chilled and unsettled. Shadows become unnaturally deep, and people may hear voices and glimpse eeting echoes of past events. Animals become restless and prone to panic, and machines suffer random glitches and breakdowns. All creatures take a –10 penalty to Willpower Tests.

**Threat Rating:** Malleus Minoris.

# **Charnel Daemon**

Accounts of encounters with the entity known as the Charnel Daemon are some of the most horrific records held by the Ordos Calixis. Powerful and singularly murderous, in order to gain a foothold in our reality, the Charnel Daemon must be summoned by extraordinarily bloody rituals performed by a powerful cult magus. Once manifested, it is in the form of an uncontrollable berserker, that will seek slaughter without end, working to remake the world in an image more pleasing to the Blood God.

†**Daemonic Presence:** The area within 25 metres of the Daemon is permeated with the radiation of the warp, manifesting as an all-pervasive smell of blood, rippling nausea, and the shrill of a continuous agonized scream on the edge of mortal hearing. All characters take a –10 penalty to Willpower Tests while in the area.

‡**Fuelled By Slaughter:** Every time the Charnel Daemon kills a living creature, it heals 1d10 points of Damage. **Weapons:** Teeth and claws (1d10+10 R; Pen 3, Tearing). **Threat Rating:** Malleus Majoris.

# **Incarnate Lesser Daemon**

The shapes and blasphemous hungers that a Daemon might exhibit are without number, and literally thousands of different manifestations are recorded within the restricted archives of the Ordo Malleus. Many reflect the nature and drives of their patrons among the powers of Chaos, acting as foot soldiers in the legions of hell, while others represent the congealed stuff of mankind's worst fears and hidden evils. Regardless of their shape, incarnate Daemons are formed from the pure substance of the warp and cannot maintain their grip on our universe without the aid of bloodshed, misery and death.

# **Dispayres**

Famished and tattered figures with hollow eye-sockets and mouths frozen in endless silent screams, these Daemons serve no single great power; they desire only to bring sorrow and madness. Darkness clings about them, and they make formidable stalkers and assassins for malefic cults.

# **horrors**

Rolling, twisting, twitching masses of iridescent flesh and fire. Horrors serve their master Tzeentch, Chaos power of change, intrigue and sorcery. Their many mouths scream and gibber, and their shifting, clawed hands twitch with incantations.

# **PsYchNeueIN—the mara straIN**

Thankfully rare, Psychneuein are vile warp entities drawn to the mental emanations of unprotected, badly injured or nascent psykers whose minds they attack for the obscene purpose of gestating their progeny. Psychneuein have been known to evidence various distinct genus, of which the Mara Strain is deemed among the most dangerous.

### **The Mara Strain**

The Mara Strain was first identified by Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Ark-Ashtyn during a heavy infestation at the mining penitentiary on the ice-world of Mara in the Calixis Sector, three centuries ago. Although the Mara facility was subsequently decommissioned, the tale of the "ice station massacre" remains a favourite dark fable among the sector's spacefarers. Since then, confirmed incidents of Mara infection have occurred on the sector worlds of Dusk, Lachrymae and Pellucida V as well as several vessels transiting near Mara, although these incidences remain thankfully very few.

#### **The Infested—Final Stage Mania**

The victim can be any creature with a Psy Rating of 1 or more. Apply all of the following modifications:

- Halve Intelligence and Fellowship Characteristics
- Increase Psy Rating by 1.
- Gain Corpus Conversion, Die Hard, Fearless talents.
- Gain immunity to Stun.
- • Creatures that attempt to establish any form of telepathic contact with the infected creature suffer a psychic backlash and takes a level of Fatigue.

• If the infected creature attempts a Psychic Power that results in Perils of the Warp, instead of rolling to see what happens, 1d10 adult psychneuein are born, killing the host in the process.

• If the psyker is slain, there is a 25% chance of 1d10 adult Psychneuein appearing. Otherwise, 1d10 larvae erupt instead.

# **Plaguebearers**

Bloated and malformed, clutching rusted butcher blades and glaring out with a single milky-white eye, these foulest of Daemons are walking incubators of the most terrible diseases and excrescence, serving Nurgle, Chaos power of decay and contagion.

# **Unclean Spirit**

The warp is a place of myriad horrors and numberless dangers, and the entities that seethe and boil within its turbulent depths range from the vast powers of the so-called Chaos gods to mindless, verminous predators. The Ordo Malleus classifies some in this latter category as unclean spirits, and while they lack the reality-damaging powers of true Daemons, they can still prove dangerous if loosed on the world.

**Threat Rating:** Malleus Minima.

# **DAEMONHOSTS** Daemonhosts

Daemonhosts are unholy creations of foul and dangerous rituals in which a powerful Daemon is bound into a living human host body and enslaved to its creator's will. An utterly foul act, the creation of a Daemonhost condemns the soul of the host body to eternal torment and provides a lasting home in the universe for a Daemon to work its evil. Despite the horror of their creation, there are those within the Inquisition itself, it is said, who have dared to replicate the act, hoping to turn their creations against enemies of the Imperium. Unfortunately, Daemonhosts are not only the preserve of a handful of Radical Inquisitors. Insane dabblers in proscribed knowledge and the most powerful of cults have also been known to create Daemonhosts to serve them in their designs. Daemons do not rest easily under the will of any mortal, and to earn the enmity of such a creature is to gain an immortal enemy, so a Daemonhost's creator is faced with a dangerous conundrum: the more powerful the Daemonhost created, the weaker the bindings of the Daemon.

### **Daemonhost Generator**

The generator included here is intended to give you a quick way of creating these most potent opponents, or even allies, of the Inquisition, while also giving you ideas to customize your own Daemonhosts.

#### **The Method**

Creating a Daemonhost has seven stages as detailed below:

**Stage One:** Roll on **Table 12-5: Binding** to determine how many times the Daemonhost has been bound. **Stage Two:** Generate the Daemonhost's Characteristics. **Stage Three:** Generate the changes wrought on the host body. **Stage Four:** Generate the phenomena of the Daemonhost's presence.

**Stage Five:** Generate the Daemonhost's Psychic Powers. **Stage Six:** Determine Skills and Traits.

**Stage Seven:** Add your own finishing touches.

#### **Stage One: Binding**

The less strongly bound a Daemonhost is, the more powerful it will be; but the weaker the binding, the greater the chance the Daemon has to slip its master's control.

### Table 12-5: Binding

#### **Roll Effect**

- 01–10 **Unbound:** The Daemon, within its host, has broken free of its fetters. Such a creature is the walking embodiment of the corrupting power of the warp.
- 11–40 **Once-bound:** A Daemonhost that has the least number of bindings placed on it is apocalyptically powerful, but only barely contained.
- 41–70 **Twice-bound**: More powerfully bound, a Daemonhost is still extremely dangerous, but its raw power is tempered and more easily controlled.
- 71–00 **Thrice-bound:** The most strongly bound Daemonhosts are the least likely to rebel, but are still not without inhuman strength and power.

# **Stage Two: Characteristics**

Once you have determined the extent of the Daemonhost's binding, cross-reference this with the profile given in the following table to give the Daemonhost's Characteristics.

| Table 12-6: Daemonhost Characteristics |         |            |             |              |

# **Stage Three: Unholy Changes**

Daemonhosts are covered with chains and amulets, their skin punctured by needles and their flesh etched with sigils. The host body beneath the bindings is warped by the terrible essence trapped within it. To determine what changes have been visited on the Daemon's fleshy prison, roll on **Table 12-7: Unholy Changes** that follows.

For unbound Daemonhosts, roll 1d5+1 times; for once-bound, roll 1d5; for twice-bound, roll 1d5–1 (minimum once); and for thrice-bound, roll 1d5–2 (minimum once). In all cases, re-roll duplicate results.

|       | Table 12-7: Unholy Changes                                                                                                                     |

| 01–04 | Vestigial Horns: Two small horns project from the Daemonhost's forehead.                                                                       |

| 09–12 | Boils: The flesh of the Daemonhost is covered with weeping boils and sores.                                                                    |
| 13–16 | Cat's Eyes: The Daemonhost's eyes are yellow and the pupils are black slits.                                                                   |

|       | Damage.                                                                                                                                        |
| 61–64 | Bloated Form: The host body is grossly bloated.                                                                                                |
| 65–68 | Snake Nest: Snakes coil around the Daemonhost, flowing from its mouth and rents in its flesh. Whenever it deals Damage, the target must        |
|       | succeed on a Hard (-20) Toughness Test or be affected as if by a hallucinogen grenade for 1d5 Rounds.                                          |
| 69–72 | Insect Hive: The Daemonhost's body is a hive for a mass of insects that crawl across it. It gains 1d10 Wounds.                                 |
| 73–76 | Corpse-Host: The host's body has expired during the ritual and is visibly rotting—yet it still lives! It increases its Toughness by 1d10.      |
| 77–80 | Elongated limbs: The Daemonhost's limbs are distorted and elongated. The Daemonhost can attack creatures up to three metres away in            |
|       | close combat.                                                                                                                                  |
| 81–84 | Scales: The Daemonhost's body is covered in a fine layer of snake-like scales. It gains the Natural armor 3 trait.                            |

| 89–92 | Featureless Face: Though it has no effect on its senses, the Daemonhost's head is smooth, featureless flesh.                                   |
| 93–96 | Charred Form: The host body appears horrifically burnt. The Daemonhost is immune to all forms of fire and heat damage, even psychic            |
|       | fire (but not holy flame).                                                                                                                     |
| 97–00 | Seeming Normality: If you roll this result, do not roll any further on this table. Also, any results already rolled are removed. The host body |
|       | seems perfectly normal, apart from the instruments of its binding. It adds 1d10 to its Fellowship.                                             |

### **Stage Four: Daemonic Presence**

The very presence of a Daemonhost has an effect on its surroundings. The diameter of this area is equal to the Daemon's Willpower Characteristic in metres. Within this area, all characters experience a particular set of phenomena and take a -10 penalty to Willpower Tests. The number of phenomena caused depends on how strongly the Daemonhost is bound: unbound Daemonhosts cause four phenomena; once-bound Daemonhosts cause three phenomena; twice-bound Daemonhosts cause two phenomena; and thrice-bound Daemonhosts cause one phenomenon. For each phenomenon the Daemonhost has, roll once on **Table 12-8: Daemonic Phenomena** that follows. Re-roll any duplicate rolls.

| 09–12 | …everyone tastes gritty ashes.                                                                                    |  |  |  |

| 29–32 | …liquid falls upwards in drops, pooling on the ceiling.                                                           |  |  |  |

# Example Daemonhost:

# **HEDRODAL**

### **Twice-bound Daemonhost**

Created by the false prophets of the Pilgrims of Hayte using the unwilling body of the fallen Interrogator Cripon, Hedrodal is a foul thing. A long purple snaketongue flicks from between its grinning teeth, glowing eyes burn with an icy light and its chain-crossed flesh is covered in rolling eyes and glistening boils. Everywhere Hedrodal passes there is the sound of nameless things scuttling, and lurking shadows of horrible visage can be seen inhabiting the darkness around it.
