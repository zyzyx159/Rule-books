*"The martyr's grave is the keystone of the Imperium."* — *Liber Imperialis.*

T The Imperium of Man is a war-torn empire, teetering on the brink of collapse. For ten thousand years it has been ruled by the deathless Emperor, a being of incredible power, to whom thousands of souls are sacrificed daily. The peoples of the Imperium live in a place where Daemons are real, mutation is frequent and death is a constant companion. To be alive in the 41st Millennium is to know that the universe is a terrifying and hostile place. It is a place where you are but one amongst billions and, no matter how heroic your death, you will not be missed.

A truly vast domain, the Imperium is spread amongst the many stars of the galaxy. Its territories encompass untold millions of stars and countless more human lives. In its name, terrible wars are fought and desperate sacrifices made, yet even this river of carnage and blood is a small price to pay, for the Imperium is the guardian of mankind. Were it to pass into nothingness, so too would the human race, destroyed by enemies uncountable, to the laughter of the Dark gods.

# The Feudal Order THE FEUDAL ORDER

*"The Emperor asks only that you obey." —* Queen Coralie of Acreage.

The Imperium covers a wide area of galactic space, sprawling over countless worlds. There are few universals amongst these varying planets. Culture, language and even the human form appear in seemingly infinite variation across the universe. One of the few constants (at least amongst those worlds of the Imperium that are aware of its existence) is the network of feudal obligation and responsibility.

Each Imperial planet owes fealty to a planetary governor. This individual in turn renders to the Imperium's priesthood a tithe of men, materials and loyalty. The governor is also expected to reject enemies of the Imperium, and to ensure that the psykers upon his planet do not fall into witchery or possession. In return, the governor can call upon the priesthood (or Adeptus Terra as they are properly known) in times of dire threat and request aid.

The Adeptus Terra comprises a bewildering variety of departments, bureaus, sub-divisions and offices, each of which deal with a particular aspect of maintaining the continuity of the Imperium. Each order has an obligation to care for its given area of control. This weight of responsibility grows as feudal obligation passes up through a mind-numbing array of ranks within each Adepta. From lowly scribes computing a hive world's annual nutra-slurry yield to mighty sector commanders overseeing the assemblage of a crusading fleet, vassalage and power passes ever upwards to the titular heads of the Imperium, the High Lords of Terra. These powerful individuals rule from ancient Terra in the Emperor's name.

Based on Terra itself, the Emperor is a silent being of awesome power. His withered carcass is cradled within an arcane artefact of incredibly occult design. This Golden Throne, as it is known, sustains the Emperor's life force whilst He guards humanity from the Daemonic beings that would destroy mankind utterly. For hundreds of centuries He has fought this psychic battle and for hundreds of centuries mankind has offered Him their fealty, worship and devotion.

# **THE ADEPTUS TERRA**

The priesthood which serves the Lord of humanity is often referred to as "the right hand of the Emperor". It falls to the Adeptus Terra to interpret His will and minister to the Imperium. Many hundreds of thousands of souls labour across the galaxy to serve this vast organisation. There are numerous ancient institutions that make up the priesthood, each with various names on various planets. These varying Adepta, as they are traditionally known, each have a specific function to carry out in the Emperor's name.

# **The Adeptus Arbites**

# **(The Judges, Lawgivers)**

The Adeptus Arbites are the watchers of the law. It is given to them to maintain order amongst the higher echelons of Imperial governance wherever a planetary governor seeks to abuse his rule, wherever populist unrest seeks to unseat the

rightful dominion of the Imperium, wherever thoughts of personal gain at the Emperor's expense cross the minds of the ruling classes, there you will find the dogged agents of the Lawgivers.

# **The Adeptus Astra Telepathica (The Astropaths, Psykers)**

Blessed are the blind, for they have looked upon the glorious light of the Emperor directly and no true servant of the Golden Throne could ask for more. Through the agonising ritual of soul-binding, these psykers have been gifted with a small portion of the Emperor's incredible will. Thus protected from the worst evils of predation by warp entities, these unseeing servants of Terra can fulfil their primary function, preserving communication between the far-flung worlds of the Imperium.

# **The Adeptus Astronomica (The Beacon, The Light of The Emperor, The Ward of Man)**

The Black Ships bring thousands of psykers daily to the birthplace of man and many of those so tithed find themselves contributing to the vast psychic choir of the Astronomican. This steady beacon burns bright in the warp; it is the Emperor's will manifest, shining from Holy Terra, and guides Navigators across the Imperium. The process of lending their psychic power to focus the beam quickly leaves the choristers as lifeless husks, but they give themselves willingly, for without the Astronomican the Imperium would cease to exist.

**The Adeptus Custodes (The Guardians, Watchers of The Throne, The Thousand Companions)**

These are among the mightiest warriors in all the Imperium, the praetorians of the Emperor. They stand ever-vigilant outside the 
brazen doors which seal His holy chamber. They are entirely beyond reproach and they are among the few over whom the Inquisition has no power.

They never leave the inner sanctums of the Imperial Palace and serve from birth to death within its hallowed halls. Yet they are among the few of the servants of mankind who will ever look upon the Emperor directly, and for that they receive blessings beyond all measure.

# **The Adeptus Mechanicus (The Priesthood of Mars, Tech-Priests)**

The domains of the Adepts of Mars exist semi-autonomously within the Imperium, an empire within an empire, a right given to them by the Emperor Himself at the very dawn of recorded history. They are the guardians of technology, the magi of

machinery. It is theirs alone to know how to coax forth the life of a sun in a plasma containment field, how best to apply the blessings of activation and maintenance to the massive Titan war machines, how to ensure that the engines of the Emperor's starships run smooth and true.

The Adepts of Mars worship the Emperor in the guise of the Machine God. To them, mankind is in a fallen state that was at the height of its powers during the Dark Age of Technology, when the secrets of the universe were known to all. Knowledge then, lies in the past and the Adeptus Mechanicus will go to any lengths to uncover the great secrets of antiquity, scouring the universe for any scrap of information from their holy book—the Standard Template Construct system. They hold that, were the STC to be restored in full, it would reveal all of the powers of the hallowed past.

The Tech-Priests venerate machines and regard them as superior to flesh. Many of them believe that the Machine God desires them to shed this weakness and so they often sport numerous bionic modifications. These mechanical enhancements add to their air of otherness and further help to set them apart from the rest of humanity.

Through rune and hammer, the Tech-Adepts are the wards of the arcane and they guard their knowledge jealously. But for all their might, they are not beyond the watchful gaze of the Inquisition.

# **The Administratum (The Scriptists, The Enumerators)**

The huge Administratum sees to the running of the Imperium. Needless to say, its servants are legion. At the will of the Adeptus Terra, the Administratum collects the Imperial tithe, sends out colonists, mobilises the military, catalogues planets and much, much more.

Truly stultifying levels of bureaucracy exist within the Administratum and some wayward souls believe that the Imperium survives despite, rather than because of, its efforts. The Administratum has become synonymous with the Adeptus Terra in many places and, incorrectly, the terms are often used interchangeably. The faceless servants of the Administratum can be found all over the Imperium, ensuring that all things are accomplished in the correct manner, even if that may take a thousand years.

# **THE ADEPTUS MINISTORUM (THE ECCLESIARCHY, CULT IMPERIALIS, MINISTORUM)**

The Adeptus Ministorum is not formally part of the Adeptus Terra. Rather it is a sister organisation which works hand-in-glove with the servants of Earth. The Adeptus Ministorum derives its power and authority from the common belief in the Emperor's divinity. Also known as the Ecclesiarchy, after its chief high priest, the Ecclesiarch, the Adeptus Ministorum is vast and powerful. Its duty is to guide and interpret the innumerable ways that humanity has found to worship the Emperor, shepherding the myriad worlds of man along the unsteady path that lies between heresy and true devotion. Whole worlds lie within its administration and on many others still they are the most powerful Imperial institution.

Like the Administratum, the Ecclesiarchy is a complex and byzantine organisation. A bewildering hierarchy of priests, confessors, cardinals, novices, clerics, bishops and missionaries all owe fealty to the Ecclesiarch in his palace on Earth. Just as varied are the various roles within the Ministorum, from wandering missionaries, to charismatic preachers and theosophical scholars. Two of the most famous institutions within the Adeptus Ministorum are the training orphanages of the Schola Progenium and the battle-sisters of the Adepta Sororitas.

# **THE INQUISITION**

The Imperium is assailed by countless enemies both from within and without. The attentions of unclean xenos, the invidious influences of the misguided followers of the Ruinous Powers, planetary unrest, mutation, rogue psykers, rebellious Imperial lords and more all work constantly to bring the Imperium down, to the ultimate extinction of mankind. Yet somehow it survives and humanity endures.

The Inquisition is one of the many reasons for the persistence of man in a hostile universe. Known as the "left hand of the Emperor", the Inquisition operates across the Imperium and beyond to suppress and eliminate those forces that would destroy the holy dominion of mankind over the stars.

Inquisitors are empowered to go anywhere and do anything whatever they must to ensure the survival of the Imperium. Their Inquisitorial Seal opens all doors bar none, and even the vaunted planetary governors must acquiesce to their demands without complaint or delay, lest they be themselves regarded as suspect. They will commit acts, no matter how vile, to maintain the unchanging integrity of the Imperium, and they will put whole planets to death in order to see that this is so.

The members of the Inquisition vary enormously in physical appearance, methodology and mentality. Some operate alone and in secret, hidden from the eyes of the common man, while others operate openly and carry dozens of acolytes and agents in their cadre. What they do have in common is that they answer only to their Order, and each Order answers only to the Emperor. Their efforts can be checked by no Adepta and they are utterly, fanatically devoted to the defence of the Imperium. Even the most loyal and honest Imperial citizen is likely to break into a cold sweat on learning that the Inquisition is nearby—and that suits its members perfectly. For more information see **Chapter X: The Inquisition.**

Types of Planets

# Planets of the Imperium Types of Culture 

*"True faith is blind and justified."*

*—* Confessor Faust.

T The Imperium encompasses countless worlds. No one has ever been able to map them and no one can even say how many there are. Entire departments of the Adeptus Administratum are devoted to cataloguing the worlds in the Emperor's domains, a never-ending task, for it is in a state of eternal flux.

> Furthermore, the Adeptus Terra holds that the whole human race and the entire galaxy are under the Emperor's rule—the Imperium has a manifest destiny to unite mankind, impose its laws on every human world and destroy all alien life. The true scope of the Imperium is, therefore, the entire galaxy, though this is far from actuality. The Imperium jealously guards its territory whenever it can but its sheer size means that it cannot react to every circumstance. Many planets live and die alone, with only the truly great threats commanding the attention of the Adeptus Terra. Worlds are frequently lost to aliens, rebellion or disasters, with news of their destruction sometimes taking centuries to reach Terra. The Imperium's borders undergo constant change, with new worlds discovered, conquered or colonized and old ones lost.

# **TYPES OF PLANET**

The galaxy teems with worlds—gas giants, worlds of frozen methane, huge, globular masses of hydrogen that failed to become stars, and many more besides. Some of these are mined or exploited in some way, they may even harbor their own forms of truly bizarre alien life, but it is mostly upon small rocky worlds that mankind, and its enemies, are found. Within this category of world, however, are many variations and humanity endures all manner of environments in its quest to survive in a cruel and unwelcoming universe.

# **Language**

Low Gothic (also called Imperial Gothic or simply Gothic) is the "official" language of the Imperium, the tongue of its Adepts and of Terra. Most worlds have been a part of the Imperium for long enough to have adopted Low Gothic as a universal tongue but there are still a great many feral worlds on which Imperial Gothic is not spoken. Inevitably, dialects of Gothic differ from world to world and can be mutually unintelligible. Older planets frequently maintain archaic tongues of their own, to the extent that ruling aristocracies might only know enough Low Gothic to swear in. For highly formal matters, the Adeptus Terra use High Gothic, a precursor language of Imperial Gothic. Many Ecclesiarchy rituals, Administratum edicts and Imperial charters use this ancient and venerable language.

# **TYPES OF CULTURE**

Just as the people of the Imperium live in hugely varied environments, so too do their cultures vary immensely.

# **Hive Worlds**

The Imperium's most populous worlds are its hive worlds. The populations of these planets are so high that the people live in huge cities, truly immense manylayered structures that reach high into the sky, each housing billions of individuals. Hive worlds often provide much-needed

labour, their manufactoria producing mountains of war materiel and other goods to meet the Imperial tithe demands. Most hive worlds started out as relatively hospitable places but have become severely polluted, the areas outside the hives reduced to ash wastes or radioactive desert by the never-ceasing industry of the great cities. Equally dangerous can be the hives themselves. The crimeridden, poverty-stricken areas, almost always found in the most polluted and decrepit lower levels of the underhive, are home to violent gangs, criminals and assorted scum as well as mutants and heretical cults who hide there from the authorities.

# **Agri-Worlds**

These farming planets, in their own way, are as vital to the Imperium as its hives. These planets are given over entirely to the production of food, which hive worlds cannot produce in sufficient quantities to keep their huge populations from starving. Many a world has whole continents given

over to livestock or fields of crops. Some agri-worlds are covered in oceans teeming with fish and a few are far stranger—worlds covered in edible fungus, scoured by swarms of nutritious insects or gas giants home to flocks of flying creatures. A few planets are used solely to provide clean water to nearby hive worlds. Agri-worlds are sometimes ruled directly by the Administratum, to help ensure that their produce is grown and harvested with maximum efficiency.

# **Forge Worlds**

Much of a forge world is like an immense factory, with industrial complexes soaring into the sky and mine workings burrowing deep into the crust. Forge worlds build great numbers of complex machines, like tanks or spacecraft parts. They are ruled by the Adeptus Mechanicus, whose training and

research facilities are located there, along with the grand cathedrals to their deity, the Omnissiah, in which the Archmagi of the Tech-Priests enact the grandest, most complex rituals to honour the Machine God. The Adeptus Mechanicus' fleets, its tech-guard armies and, most formidably of all, the Titan Legions, are also all based on forge worlds. The forge worlds are sovereign ground and the Adeptus Mechanicus is loath to allow anyone on their surface other than Tech-Priests and the legions of menials who serve them.

# **Developing Worlds**

These worlds are split into geographical areas with widely varying levels of advancement and culture. Depending on the prevailing governments, these might be countries, states, power blocks or tribal homelands. It may be the case that higher levels of technology and

wealth are concentrated around original colonisation sites. Other planets might exhibit gross variations in culture due to environment, with areas weak in natural resources being similarly weak in terms of military power, economic muscle and so on. Some planets preserve a great divide due to ancient tribal taboos, religious notions or plain old-fashioned habit. A great many worlds of the Imperium fit into this broad category, but no two are alike in the way they realise these divides.

# **Feudal Worlds**

These planets are populated by folk who have lost access to all but the most basic of technologies. Farming, simple machines such as pulleys, windmills and the like are known, but propelled flight, automatic weaponry and even powered vehicles are likely to be rare

or non-existent. These worlds are often said to be the most politically harmonious of all the planets of the Imperium, because their peoples know their place.

# **Feral Worlds**

These worlds are populated by tribal peoples largely living without the assistance of maintained technology. This may be due to a failed colonisation project, religious preferences, cultural choice, environment or some other reason. They may be aware of the Imperium in some fashion but are

unlikely to know much more than something about a large group of distant people living in the stars. These planets are frequently unsuitable for later colonisation, either due to the circumstances which drove the natives feral or because the natives themselves actively resist new people settling on their lands. People of feral worlds can range widely in culture, from Grox-hunting tribes of ancestor worshippers to wild-eyed, post-apocalyptic road warriors, fighting endlessly amongst the toxic, sand-strewn ruins of their civilisation.

# **Shrine Worlds**

These worlds are dominated by religion and acts of devotion. It may be that these places saw the birth of a famous saint or formed the battleground for a particularly important war. Often studded with temples and shrines, these worlds are frequently controlled by the Ecclesiarchy

and may form training grounds for members of their Adepta.

There are also the dark mirrors to these places of Imperial devotion—fallen worlds where the inhabitants offer up ceaseless prayer to the Dark Gods. These places of obscene sacrifices and bloody rites are not suffered continued existence for long.

# **Quarantined Worlds**

The existence of these planets is rarely made obvious but there are many of them throughout the Imperium. Travel to these worlds is forbidden except for the most well-informed and heavily armed expeditions, and even then only with a very good

reason. Death worlds, alien empires or planets where the creatures of the warp have broken through into realspace are all examples of quarantined worlds, as are planets wracked with plague. Some worlds are quarantined because no one can fathom the origins of what has been found there, be it mysterious artefacts or ancient cities—it is thought better to live in ignorance of what lies on such worlds than risk it becoming a threat. Other worlds are quarantined because every expeditionary mission there has failed to return. Planets are often quarantined by the pronouncements of Inquisitors, especially if they have uncovered some warp taint or xenos infestation that cannot be cleansed. Many quarantined worlds possess great resources that would be extremely valuable to the Imperium if they were properly explored and exploited, but there are enough tales of ancient horrors awoken on sinister alien worlds that few adepts would try to defy a planetary quarantine.

# **War Zones**

There are a great many worlds in the Imperium that can be classed as war zones. The Imperium is constantly at war and in those wars whole planets can burn. Massive campaigns can envelop dozens of systems and hundreds of worlds, many of which are utterly devastated by orbital bombardments and artillery in planet-spanning battles that last decades. Long-term war zones are hellish places where death comes quickly. The Imperium can field truly immense armies of millions of men, grinding their way across a devastated planet and reducing cities to rubble. Mercenaries flock to such places, hoping to leave soon after with their ships loaded with pay. Deserters and escaped prisoners form bands of pirates, preying on any ships unable to defend themselves or roam the war-torn planets in feral packs stealing and killing. The Administratum sends colonists from overcrowded worlds to populate war-torn worlds after the fighting has ended but the wheels of the Imperium grind slowly and a world can lie devastated for centuries before any effort is made to resettle it. These places can be some of the most ghastly in the Imperium, with ravaged environments, cracked planetary crusts, burnt-out cities and plains covered in the bones of the fallen.

# **PLANETARY GOVERNMENT**

Just as the environments and cultures of Imperial worlds vary, so too does the way they are governed. The Imperium allows most of its worlds to govern themselves, using whatever method of government the population gravitates towards. Some are hereditary monarchies, others ruled by aristocracies or warlords. Some are ruled by elected parliaments, while on others power is given to whoever can pay for it. On some worlds these are the same thing. Upon other planets, such things as democracy, free choice and even personal rights are present, though these are few and far between. Some worlds are administered directly by the various Adepta, such as agri-worlds run by the Administratum or cardinal worlds ruled by the Ecclesiarchy.

Whilst the individual countries, states, tribes, corporations, hegemonies, peoples' work collectives, and so on, may have their own various leaders, the Adeptus Terra will look to one person to fulfil the planet's tithes and obligations to the Imperium. Titles for this governor vary from planet to planet. In some cases the person judged responsible for the tithe may not even be aware that this is the case until too late. Certainly, more than one titular head of state has discovered this upon rejoining the Imperium after a period of isolation through warp storm, war or other calamity.

All governors are expected to recognise the authority of the Imperium and to uphold its laws. These responsibilities include aiding the agents of the Adeptus Arbites and the Inquisition, as well as arranging the allotted tithes for the Administratum. Governors are also expected to yield psykers up to the Black Ships of the Inquisition when required and to keep the population free of mutants, cultists, radicals and witches. In practice, some planets escape from these duties with relative ease, whilst others are placed under seemingly tyrannical restrictions. Due to the sheer size of the Imperium and the unpredictability of travel, there are many occasions where the Administratum never manages to extract its levy, or the Black Ships never arrive to take psychic individuals away. Planets can be isolated for generations and it is not unusual to encounter worlds where the Imperial tithe has been all but forgotten. Certainly the scribes of the Prol System have, in their vast libraries, several accounts of Administratum logisters arriving at worlds lost for centuries, only to discover their yearly tithe burning on vast pyres as the natives offer their dues up to the sky.

In some cases, a group of planets might have enough contact with one another to form political alliances and even minor empires. Other clusters of worlds might be connected by huge corporations, the powers of hereditary nobles, religious leaders or other such ties. In such cases, planetary governors must not only tend to the needs of the Imperium but also the whims of these power blocs.

# **Psykers**

Humans with psychic powers, from telepathy to pyrokenesis, have existed since the dawn of mankind, but their position in the Imperium is uncomfortable at best. An untrained psyker is an unguarded gateway to the warp, through which psychic predators can enter realspace and wreak havoc. It is said that whole worlds have been lost to hideous monsters of the empyrean, while rogue psykers have committed horrible crimes with their powers or led dangerous and destructive cults. On some worlds all psykers are tried as witches, subjected to tortuous ordeals and burned at the stake when their inevitable guilt is proven. Imperial law requires all worlds to monitor its psykers and subject them for testing by the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. Those who are strong enough to withstand the perils of the warp are trained to serve the Imperium. Those who are too weak are taken away by the Black Ships and never seen again.

# **PLANETARY APPEARANCE**

The peoples of the Imperium vary in their form just as their home worlds do. Whilst there is a generally agreed human standard, consisting of four limbs, one head, twenty digits and so on, local environment and genetic stock have caused all manner of interesting anomalies, evolutionary adaptations and fashions. These differences are usually cosmetic in effect; however, the more radical alterations walk the line between accepted variation and outright mutation. It is a subject of intense debate amongst some Inquisitors, and indeed the Ecclesiarchy, on what it is to be human and therefore accepted into the Imperium.

Certain planets will betray their colonial origins with the appearance of their peoples—perhaps a particular type of nose or skin colour will be dominant. Others will have clear tribal divisions. Some populations will possess unusual adaptations as a consequence of their environment. The folk of the agri-world Dreah, for example, have a grey skin, hair and eye tone, which exactly matches the flora, fauna, sky and waters of their notoriously dull planet. Some cultures may impose certain ideals of beauty that drastically alter the looks of their peoples. Certainly, many strange and terrible gangs of underhivers have been discovered, clad in hyper-fashionable armor, sporting glowing electoos, skull studs, gang mutilations and shiv scars with pride.

To some extent a similar appearance and culture binds the people of a planet together into a common stock. Usually speaking, citizens of the Imperium will prefer to spend their time with fellow natives of their world. That said, however, man has ever been titillated by the exotic, so friendship, love affairs and even children with off-worlders is not unknown on planets with a culture of such travel.

"For the warp is a strange and terrible place. You might as well throw a traveller into a sea of sharks and tell him to swim home as send him through the warp unprotected. Better it is not to let common man travel through the stars. Better still, let him not know such a thing is feasible."

> Fra Safrane, 5th aide to Navigator Da'el. Comment made prior to the departure of the second mission to search for the missing freighter 'Pride of Angelus'.

"The Revered Houses of the Navis Nobilite are one of the bastions upon which the Imperium is founded and the institution claims it can trace its ancestry back to the birth of our Great Empire.

The Great Families of the Navis Nobilite are uniquely composed of a particular form of human called a Navigator. Tech-adepts have speculated widely over the development and nature of the Navigators' unusual talents and many cast hints at shadowy genetic transmutation and interbreeding during the founding of the Navis Nobilite. Whatever their origins, the Navigators today are a glorious and esteemed organisation, loyal to the Imperium and stalwart in their faith. The peculiar powers of the Navigators can only be preserved by intermarriage; breeding with mundane humans eliminates the special abilities. This factor has led to the development of the closely-related Navigator families and the Navis Nobilite as a whole."

> Preface – Historia Et Structura Res Navis Nobilite

# Travel in the Imperium

*"You cannot fathom the mysteries of the Universe, you must simply trust in the righteousness of the Emperor's Command." —* Edicts of the Navigator Guild Calixis.

Travel between the worlds of the Imperium is rare and dangerous. The vast majority of civilians will never know the roaring tedium of shuttle flight, the sickening plummet of a drop pod or the unnerving silence of deep space. Given the huge size of the Imperium, it is impossible to cross it in the fleeting span of time given to ordinary men. Colonists, pilgrims and refugees spend many generations in the vastness of space, and many ships never survive the vagaries of travel to reach their destination. Some have theorised that the universe actively resists mankind's crude attempts to explore its mysteries. The darkness between the stars keeps its secrets close and yields them to inquisitive humanity only rarely.

# **SLOWER THAN LIGHT TRAVEL**

Used mostly for journeys between planets or closely neighbouring systems, slower than light travel involves speeds that confound mortal imagination and yet are still nothing when measured against the sheer size of the

Warp Trave l TRAVEL IN THE galaxy. Those attempting to use slower than light drives to travel any appreciable distance condemn themselves and their descendants to a shipboard life, endlessly whittling away the years until they arrive at the distant star they set out to reach.

> The average citizen is unlikely to experience slower than light space travel. Even those individuals living within a system with plentiful ships for interplanetary travel are likely to prefer the world of their birth over distant places with strange customs, odd food and "funny-looking" people. In many places, space travel is reserved for the privileged few who can afford to maintain the rituals, priests and shrines that such craft require, as well as the vast cost of the ships themselves. Tech-Priests do what they can to sate the spirits of these craft, but often even their unfathomable lore is not enough to prevent these temperamental ships from venting their rage (and oxygen) to the detriment of passengers. Sheer odds dictate that sooner or later those that frequently travel in ships between planets will experience such a disaster.

> Those worlds that have not lost the art of creating and maintaining slower than light ships jealously guard their arcane craft. This reluctance to share their guild secrets ensures the reliability and price of their vessels but also robs others of vital information required to placate their own craft.

> Institutions such as the Imperial Navy, Inquisition and various Adepta have access to much better-quality vessels, maintained with religious awe and reverence by countless generations of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

 The Chartist Captains

The space lanes of the Imperium are plied by huge, often ancient, merchant ships commanded by the Chartist Captains. Lacking Navigators or Astropaths to guide them, these civilian craft take years to travel their circuitous routes between the stars, trading and bringing supplies to worlds which need them. The ships of the Chartist Captains are the only contact many worlds have with the galaxy at large, and to some primitive worlds their arrivals are long-prophesied events of great spiritual significance. Similarly, the reports of Chartist Captains are the only evidence that many worlds still exist at all. The route of each ship, set down in its charter written up by the Adeptus Terra, can take generations to complete and a Chartist ship is home to a spacefaring community of "void born" souls who can live and die without ever setting foot on the surface of a planet.

# **WARP TRAVEL**

To move any appreciable distance within the Imperium, voyagers must resort to warp travel. This method of faster than light travel is rare, expensive and dangerous, as it requires the use of the unpredictable realm known as the warp, or immaterium. Vessels equipped with a functional warp drive are able to translate themselves into this other dimension of being by generating an envelope of Geller fields. These quixotic waves "bend" the ship through the veil of realspace into the immaterium. Once within this strange place, the ship is able to ride the currents and eddies that flow within the warp, frequently dropping back into realspace to check its positioning.

The immaterium is a bizarre and contradictory place, entirely unnatural to mankind. Looking upon the warp unprotected causes madness and corruption, and thus is greatly feared by almost everyone. Dimensions, colours, forces and emotions operate entirely differently within the warp's embrace, and this can drive even the most thick-headed crewman insane. Psykers of course, find such travel even more disturbing as their mystical senses are able to comprehend much more of the immaterium and the foul creatures that dwell within it.

Those that travel through the warp emerge to discover another of its disconcerting effects. Time does not operate normally within this other realm and so travellers can emerge to discover that centuries have passed since they started their journey, that they have merely been absent for a few seconds, or have even arrived before they left. Even skilled Navigators cannot predict how much time will be lost, gained or repeated over the course of a journey. Those that embark upon warp travel know that they will probably never return home, or that if they do so they will find it so changed that it is unrecognisable. When two or more captains of ships meet, they invariably trade dates, attempting to reconstruct the time they are missing or have gained. Needless to say, warp travel is not embarked upon lightly.

The warp is occasionally prone to great turbulence or storms of activity. These strike at random and last for an unpredictable amount of time. Whilst these storms rage, any vessels within are tossed about on roiling currents, sometimes being spat out at random locations. Other ships simply become trapped, unable to translate back into realspace, cursed to an eternity upon the waves of the warp. These storms disrupt communication across the Imperium and can sometimes herald a great disaster within realspace.

Navigators

The Navis Nobilite, or Navigators network of extended families , form a sprawling Navigator gene , all of which bear the . Navigators are different to other men, with some seeing them as mutants, but their differences are stable and, unusually, are not only tolerated by the Imperium but are essential to its very existence. A Navigator possesses a third eye in his forehead through which he can perceive the warp itself and read its currents and eddies. For anyone else to look upon the warp would be to invite madness and possession Navigator's power allows him to guide a ship through the , but a warp and reach its destination far faster than any ship could travel without him. Navigators use the great psychic beacon of the Astronomican as a fixed point to aid their route-finding. In this way they are able to complete a journey with far fewer drops into realspace to plot position. The great majority of Navigators serve in the Imperial Navy and many Navigator families are tied to Naval aristocracies by complex bonds of honour, debt and patronage.

# **COMMUNICATION**

Just as travel within the Imperium is a complicated and inexact science, so too is the business of exchanging messages between the many and varied planets that make up the Empire of Man. Planetary communications systems such as vox-casters, hardwired lines and the more advanced vox-communicators suffice to pass messages amongst the nations of a world, yet have almost no use beyond the bounds of the planet's surface. Such devices require many years for their signal to reach even the nearest planet and have no surety of even being detected when they arrive. The perils of travel ensure that human or servitor messengers are just as unreliable and potentially as slow as radio or other energy wave communications.

The Imperium then, is forced to rely upon communication by psychic, or astropathic means. Astropaths communicate with symbols and iconic images, projecting these messages through vast distances of space by means of psychic power. This process is usually exhausting and requires ritual and focus in order to keep the pskyer in the right frame of mind. These can take a wide variety of forms, such as use of the Emperor's Tarot, vision quests, automatic writing, trances, séances and the like. The Gaolist Astropaths of Hredin for example, spend many years etching their messages onto painstakingly illuminated sheets of iron and then destroy the work of art upon a massive grinding wheel. The pain of annihilating a much-loved labour is said to produce psychic messages of unparalleled clarity.

These messages are received by fellow astropaths in various ways. Some appear as vague and troubling dreams, whilst others appear as visions or mystic portents. Others appear within whatever ritual method or divination technique the receiving psyker happens to practise. Thus warning of an Ork invasion might appear as a glistening imperfection in fish entrails, a looming cloud of smoke, bleeding orifices or a worrying combination of runes or sigils within a holographic matrix.

These messages must not only be transmitted from one astropath to another but decoded at the other end. Each astropath employs slightly different symbols and each has a preferred style or "flavour". Some messages take weeks of poring over tomes of augurs and symbolism before they can be reconstructed, though the best astropaths can do this word for word. Some remain a mystery forever. Some messages are received by astropaths at entirely the wrong end of the galaxy and must be passed on to others who are nearer the place in question.

Some messages simply do not get to their intended recipient or are drastically misinterpreted along the way. In addition, there are too few astropaths. Most worlds, especially those with small populations or on the fringes of the Imperium, have no astropaths at all, and must rely on the infrequent visits of passing Chartist ships or Administratum census-takers to make contact with the outside galaxy at all. For this reason the Adeptus Terra cannot react quickly to every event in the Imperium, even when an event occurs that is great enough to attract the notice of the vast and ponderous bureaucracy. On most worlds, the Imperium feels very far away.

# **THREATS TO HUMANITY**

*"Beware the enemy within! Scorn the enemy without! Fear the enemy beyond!"* — Excerpt from *The Acolyte's Oath*.

P Perversely, for the largest empire that humanity has ever known, many planets within the Imperium feel isolated and alone in the long night of space. Across all the peoples and planets of the Imperium, fear gnaws away at the psyche, worming mistrust and desperate faith into the conscious and unconscious mind. Time and again the universe has proved itself an uncaring and frightening place. People sicken, the warp rages, xenos attack and worlds die. The people of the Imperium watch their neighbours for signs of heresy and witchery. Mankind prays to the Emperor to protect them from the woes of the universe, of which there are many.

# **DISCIPLES OF THE DARK GODS**

Time and again, the minds of man have proven fertile soil for the seeds of corruption. There are certain dark powers abroad in the universe that seduce the weak and foolish into their damnable service. These ageless beings, their names unspeakable, prey upon mankind's needs and desires. With honeyed words, forbidden knowledge, bloody rites and festering secrets they lure humanity to become their slaves.

Some within the Imperium choose to worship these Daemon gods. The ways of these cults are many. Some meet in clandestine rituals of sacrifice and incantation. Others are foolish scholars, meddling with powers beyond their ken. Others still are organisations, companies or political groups drunk with power gained through pacts with unspeakable creatures of the warp. Perhaps worst of all are the instances of entire worlds that worship the Chaos gods through ignorance or choice. All of these profane cultists invite ruin upon themselves, the Imperium and humanity.

The Adeptus Terra, planetary governors and the Inquisition watch for these disciples of Chaos, for the inevitable consequence of their meddling is pain, disaster and blood shed. The ordinary peoples of the Imperium rightly fear these cults and their malevolent masters. On many worlds an undercurrent of paranoia, suspicion and fear of Chaos cultists is the norm.

# **MUTATION**

The degeneration of the holy human form is one of the Ecclesiarchy's greatest concerns. Environmental pollution, deliberate genetic alteration, stellar radiation, alien diets and simple evolutionary adaptation have wrought manifold changes upon the physique of man across his empire of stars. Some of these mutants have a standard, stable, morphological type and are tolerated by the authorities—notable among them being the abhuman Ogryns and the ancient and noble Navigators. But to find whole worlds where the population has no eyes due to never-ending darkness, or unusually long legs because of millennia of nomadic living, is not unusual. Whether these aberrant populations are declared acceptable or not is the business of the Adeptus Terra.

But mutation can also be a sign of the Dark gods. Just as they twist and destroy the minds and souls of man, so too do they toy with his flesh, bending it into profane shapes, gifting strange abilities and creating monsters for their perverse amusement. Where such mutation is present, it is rightly abhorred. Few are willing to tolerate such a aberation within their midst and fear of mutants runs through the populations of many worlds, even those

where such things have happened but once in a hundred generations. Perhaps worse still is the constant fear of becoming a mutant oneself. Many folk pray that should this worst of all things occur, they will have the strength to end their own lives, before the mob or the Inquisition does it for them.

Some poor fools are willing mutants, seeing the distortion of their flesh as a sign of favour from the Dark gods. They seek out ways to gain more of these gifts, either by begging the Daemon gods for more of their touch or by doing their bidding in the hope of reward. Others, more poignantly, claim innocence of any wrong doing or foul worship. Whatever the case, a mutant is a mutant and must be feared, hated and destroyed. This is but one of the many reasons Imperial citizens tend to be highly intolerant and many innocent men, upon finding themselves on a new world, have been murdered by a frenzied mob for merely appearing to be different.

On WitchcraftThe question of witchcraft exercises the minds of a great many of the Emperor's servants. Indeed, one whole arm of the holy Inquisition Ordo Hereticus—has the finding and destruction of these dangerous beings as one —the of its primary activities, and several other organisations exist to contain, exploit and control these human psychics.

It is said by a heretical few that mankind stands upon the brink of an evolutionary change, that every year the incidence of psykers rises and that one day the entirety of mankind will become a new, psychic race True or not.

 , the psykers of the Imperium are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they enable the continued existence of the Imperium—the astropaths, the seers, Imperial psykers, the savant battle-psykers of the Guard the Space Marines , the Librarians of , even the Emperor Himself—these loyal servants of mankind are psykers all , good and necessary . Yet they are few in number and for every mind that is strong enough to stand against the perils of the warp hundreds of others whose minor gifts , there are , whether they seem a boon or a burden to the individual, are a clear danger to the worlds of man lead to intrusions into the physical universe by warp entities or leave the individual.

Concerning The Three Great Threats To The Safety Of Man On Daemons

On Daemons we shall not dwell here, for the very existence of such fell beings is a terrible secret and must be hidden from the minds of those who would fall prey to them. A Daemon is a warp entity, a terrible creature of thought and energy brought forth into existence by the twisted needs of sentient beings, or at least so the high masters of the Ordo Malleus say. To even think of them is to invite their attention and only the steeliest mind, the most powerful faith, is enough to overcome their utter, monstrous evil. Inconceivable as it may seem, there are those who would consort with the Daemon, for they whisper dark things in the night to those who would listen and make many promises of temporal or eternal power. They can be brought forth willingly, by the witch or by certain arcane sorceries, or they may try to force a way through into the world through the unsuspecting portal of an untrained psyker's mind. However they become incarnate, if they achieve their goal, just one Daemon can bring ruination to all it encounters. One need not talk of the Night of Silence in Atraxian III's capital, nor of the lost world of Abandoned Hope, which to this day is warded by the Inquisition, knowledge of its existence forbidden to all. Make no mistake, to face a Daemon is to face damnation, to court a Daemon is to embrace it.

Concerning The Three Great Threats To The Safety Of Man On Xenos

It is mankind's manifest destiny to rule this galaxy, of that there is no doubt. Spiritual perils may beset us, the physical universe may assail us, but it is the Emperor's will that mankind and mankind alone will bestride the stars, and to that end we fervently bend our lives. There are many other creatures in this galaxy, unclean creatures born of worlds far from the sacred soil of Holy Terra, whose misbegotten forms are an insult to those who wear the shape decreed by the Lord of Man as fitting and right. Some of these creatures are weak and harmless, and easily extirpated, their planets expropriated for the true masters of the stars, their memory expunged. But there are other foiled and mankind cast down , stronger races that would see the will of the Emperor Among them are the savage greenskin Orks

 galaxy with their endless desire for war , whose numberless multitudes plague the . Hulking creatures, bigger than a man, they are mindless, yet powerful and unafraid. Elsewhere can be found the fickle Eldar, those who cannot be trusted, beings which extend the hand of friendship whilst clasping a dagger behind their back. Beware these fiends deadly as their lying tongues ; their machineries of war are as swift and as . Likewise the Tyranids, blasphemous monstrosities who reduce worlds to bare rocks in their feeding frenzy, their endless armies made up of hell- spawned bio-constructs.

Other things dwell in the dark places of space—the Hrud, whose very presence is poison even to the rightful progression of time; the Tau grotesque ends with no thought for the proper rites , whose heretical technicians enslave technology to their ; the Verminthiculians, wild mercenaries and reavers. But fear not, the alien may be legion but man is the stronger, and their warmongering is but the desperate savagery of those who know that their end draws near.

# **REBELLION**

The Imperium is the only rightful authority of mankind. It has been decreed by the Emperor, and His will, executed by the Adepts of Terra, is absolute. But man has ever been a fractious creature and not all agree that this should be the case. Therefore the rule of Terra must, by necessity, be harsh. Be this as it may, the size of the Imperium means the grip of governance is, perforce, loose, and rebellion is only regarded to have taken place when one of the tithes goes refused.

Worlds which rise up to shake off the fatherly hand of the Emperor fall into the following four main categories:

**Governmental Revolt:** Occasionally the ruling body of such a world might misguidedly decide that their world would be far better off outside of the Imperium. They might not have been visited for a thousand years or the planetary governor may harbor territorial ambitions, but whatever their motivations, the result is the same—ruthless and immediate repression. These revolts must be dealt with swiftly and graphic examples made of the ringleaders, for if just one planet is shown to succeed in such a quest, others will certainly follow. It may take centuries to quash a revolt, but no human world must be allowed to secede. Assassination, planetary assault and, occasionally, Exterminatus are all righteous tools that may be employed to bring the wayward world to heel.

**Popular Revolt:** It is a regrettable fact that many citizens of the Imperium suffer the most horrendous living conditions in less than ideal environments. From time to time, a particularly bold demagogue may rally his fellows and overthrow the government. This only becomes a problem if they then go on to defy the authority of the Imperium, otherwise the new regime will go unmolested—it is ordinarily not the adepts' way to impose governmental form upon a population. Foolishly, flush with success, the rebellious people of a world often go on to do just that, mistakenly identifying the Imperium with their oppression and not their salvation.

Also, it is sometimes better in planets with a particular strategic importance to ensure continuance of governance. In both these cases the forces of the Imperium are brought to bear.

**Xenos Infiltration**: There are many creatures in the universe that exist by using other creatures as their proxy. These may be creatures from the physical realm, such as Genestealers, or beings such as the Enslavers, who somehow have a material being but dwell within the empyrean. Sometimes these worlds carry on seemingly as normal, the rest of the galaxy unaware of the dark, alien cancer eating at their heart. As often as not though, the alien-dominated population will rise up in armed rebellion. In either case, utter destruction of the infested inhabitants is, regrettably, the best course of action. This can be effected via tectonic destabilisation, Exterminatus, cyclonic torpedoes or viral (general or geno-tailored) bombardment, dependant upon the importance of the world and possibilities of recolonisation.

**Daemonic Infiltration:** A planet may turn to worship of the Dark gods under a number of circumstances. Suppression of such revolts must be handled carefully—destruction of the population may be the Dark Powers' actual aim, as the psychic death scream of millions of people can be enough to permanently open a rift between the warp and the real universe. Planetary invasion by specialist formations is advisable, followed immediately by planetary cleansing or destruction.

# **ON ORGANISATIONAL DISAGREEMENT**

*Regrettably, even the true organs of galactic governance can become embroiled in disagreements with each other. The very creation of the Imperium as it stands today is entirely predicated by the actions of the Warmaster CENSORED—CODE 15/775/Sigma and one only has to look at the wickedness perpetuated by the High Lord Goge Vandire to see that it is inadvisable to rest too much power in the hands of any one of the Emperor's hands. It is only fitting that each Adept should maintain a healthy suspicion of his peers.*

*Divided we stand, united we fall. E Unis Pluribum.*

*Taken from The Inquisitorial Omnibus of Actual Governmental Destabilisation vol 987, Chapter 2: Threat & Consequences. Passages quoted penned by Explicator-General Diomedes Gann, of the Cross-Ordo Harmonisation Conclave, M36.3679. Revised by Inquisitor Eusebius Bhail, M39.4487.*

# WAR

*"The Emperor asks only that you hate." —* Last words of Commissar Roth.

I I n war humanity excels, and the Emperor's armies are spread across the galaxy. The threat or effects of war are never far away, no matter where you go in the Imperium. Mankind seeks to purge the stars of its enemies, and the bloody carnage it wreaks in doing so shows no sign of abating. The Imperium's military is at once mighty, glorious and terrible.

# **IMPERIAL GUARD**

The Imperial Guard is the backbone of the Imperium's military might. Millions upon millions of well-trained men and women, organised into thousands of regiments, make up the Guard. With lasgun and bayonet they march upon alien battlefields and garrison vital worlds. They form the Imperium's first line of defence and they strike the first blow in many crusades. Its regiments are drawn in great tithes of manpower from the Imperium's worlds and each regiment has a unique character and fighting tradition, from the rigid discipline of the Steel Legion to the stealthy brutality of the pale-skinned Stygian 23rd and the unflinching bravery of the Vostroyans. Vast conscript armies, elite special forces, massive tank columns and glorious sabre-wielding cavalry can all be found in the Imperial Guard, often fighting alongside one another on Emperor-forsaken worlds they have never heard of. Regiments do not remain on their home worlds but are raised explicitly to be sent to fight and die light years away from home. And die they do, for the Imperial Guard bear the weight of the Imperium's wars. It is said that the Emperor knows the name of every soldier that has fallen fighting in His wars—but if that is true, He is the only one who can comprehend just how many Imperial Guardsmen have died in the ten thousand years since the Emperor ascended to the Golden Throne. Those who survive the grinding horrors of a lifetime of war are frequently gifted a portion of the very land they fought to conquer as a reward. As with many things in the Imperium, this is a mixed blessing indeed.

The Imperial Guard regiments are raised from the local armies of the Imperium's worlds as part of a planet's tithe to the Imperium. These regiments are normally deployed according to the orders of the Adeptus Terra. However, when the High Lords declare a major military campaign (often referred to as a "crusade") they appoint a Warmaster chosen from among highranking Imperial Guard officers to command the campaign's regiments. One of the most famous Warmasters, Macharius, was given the title Lord Solar on account that he conquered a thousand worlds on the Imperium's eastern fringe and expanded the Imperium to the very edge of the Astronomican's reach.

# **IMPERIAL NAVY**

The Imperial Navy holds nearly all of the Imperium's fighting vessels; local governments, Warmasters and others are forbidden to maintain their own fleets of warships. Their spacecraft include some of the most potent engines of destruction in the whole galaxy, including mighty battleships thousands of years old. The Navy's ships range from small escorts with a crew of a few dozen to the immense Emperor-Class battleships which might have tw-

# The Commissariat

The Imperial Guard is exposed to terrible threats which can shake the resolve of even the most steel-hearted veteran, from bizarre aliens to the terrifying inhabitants of the warp. To encourage the men to fight the most horrendous of situations, commisars are attached to regiments of Imperial Guard. The role of a commissar is to fight alongside the regiment when morale is flagging or the men are not fighting with sufficient zeal 's officers and take control . In such situations a commissar can take over command from an officer and summarily execute any man who tries to flee. Even the colonel of a regiment must be sure to display courage and zeal at all times when a commissar is watching him. Commissars are orphans educated within the Ecclesiarchy and selected from among those who show fearless faith in their Emperor 's Schola Progenium . They are then assigned by the Commissariat to Imperial Guard regiments whether the regiment in question likes it or not. Commissars are pious, self-righteous and unswerving in their purpose. They are exceptionally brave and many a seemingly hopeless battle has been turned by a commissar taking command. However, they are universally feared and loathed by the men of the Imperial Guard and are always the first against the wall when a regiment mutinies.

enty thousand souls or more on board. The Navy also includes fighter and bomber crews and aircraft that support the Imperial Guard on the ground.

The Navy's officer class is highly traditional and aristocratic in character. The Imperium's noble families frequently boast naval officers among their number and naval dynasties dominate many battlefleets. Elitism is a virtue on most ships, where the officers' lives are in stark contrast to those of the ratings and engine crews. With thousands of crew living and dying on ships that can spend decades without seeing port, a ship of the Imperial Navy becomes a society in its own right; a city in space. Mutinies are not unknown and the Naval security battalions are a familiar sight on the decks of all Naval ships, their black visors and shotguns constantly reminding the men that obedience is their duty to the Emperor.

The Navy relies on many other organisations to function. Perhaps most importantly, these ancient and complex ships could not function without a complement of Tech-Priests who know how to appease the ships' machine-spirits and maintain technology that is too old and mysterious to be replicated. The Navy is also reliant on the Tech-Priests of Mars for refits, upgrades, repairs and new ships.

It is usual for a warship to have astropaths on board, for proper communication is essential if the Imperium is to be defended. Many captains are glad to have Ministorum clergy among their crew, ministering to the spiritual needs of the men and steeling their spirits with sermons. Commissars are appointed to the larger ships, watching over the moral fibre of the crew and providing a watch against mutiny and impiety. Then, of course, there is the Navigator of each vessel, whose family can occupy entire spires jutting out into space atop the ship.

# **THE ADEPTUS ASTARTES**

The Adeptus Astartes, known as the Space Marines, are the elite warriors of the Imperium. They are few in number and regarded with almost mythical awe by most folk, for they are inheritors of traditions founded by the Emperor Himself. The Space Marines are divided into Chapters, each possessing a thousand Space Marines along with its own support staff and spacefleet. It is said that there are around a thousand such Chapters in the Imperium.

A Space Marine is recruited in adolescence from among the most violent cultures of the Imperium. His body is hugely enhanced with new organs promoting muscle and bone growth to give him immense strength, size and resilience. His mind is similarly enhanced; hypno-doctrination and sleeplearning give him both a fervent belief in the Imperium and the knowledge of weapons and tactics to bring the Emperor's wrath to the battlefield. Upon completing his augmentation and training (which not all novices survive), he is issued with his wargear, including a suit of power armor. This armor is one of the most powerful symbols of Imperial might, depicted in statuary and stained-glass windows across the Imperium. Equipped with nerve-fibre bundles so it moves in sync with his body, a Space Marine's armor not only grants him great strength and protection but is a work of art, resplendent in the heraldry of his Chapter.

Each Chapter is independent from the Adeptus Terra. While most will eagerly answer the summons of a Warmaster or a plea for help from somewhere in the Imperium, some Chapters have their own agendas and cannot be relied upon entirely. All, however, serve the Emperor loyally with complete devotion.

All Chapters have proud traditions and distinct characteristics that translate into the way they fight. The ferocious Space Wolves, for instance, are more fiercely independent than most other Chapters and fight on their own terms up close with chainswords and bolt pistols. The Iron Hands, on the other hand, have close ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus and are the masters of siege warfare, arming their warriors with an array of devastating heavy weapons and tanks. Many Chapters are legends, and names such as the Blood Angels, Ultramarines, Dark Angels and Imperial Fists are spoken of with hushed awe among Imperial citizens. A Space Marine Chapter has its own fleet of fast spacecraft and can react far more quickly to a threat than the Imperial Guard or Navy, making the Adeptus Astartes one of the only forces in the Imperium that can mount a rapid response to a crisis. The Space Marines are extremely few in number compared to the size of the Imperium and few citizens will ever see one in the flesh, but without them the Imperial military and the human race would slide ever faster towards destruction.

**GREY KNIGHTS** Deathwatch

The Space Marines of the Grey Knights Chapter are amongst the most highly specialised of the Adeptus Astartes, designed to specifically defend the Imperium against the threat of Chaos. The Grey Knights are permanently attached to Ordo Malleus and their Chapter Master is rumoured to be a member of the Inner Conclave of the Inquisition. No ordinary warriors, Grey Knights are chosen from amongst the most fearsome and savage feral cultures, each one an emergent psyker who has undergone arduous tests of faith, strength, endurance and courage that would break all but the strongest.

Grey Knights fight in baroque, heavily ornamented suits of armor, carrying mighty sigil-encrusted swords and halberds. These warriors alone can stand before the might of a Greater Daemon with any hope of banishing it back to the warp from whence it came.

The millennia the Grey Knights have spent in battle against the forces of Chaos has furnished them with blasphemous knowledge, painstaking pieced together by the Inquisitors of Ordo Malleus. Each warrior carries a copy of the sacred Liber Daemonica, the holy battle rites of the Chapter, in a ceramite case on his breastplate, and it is this which most symbolises a Grey Knight's most potent weapon; an unshakable faith in the Divine Emperor of Mankind.

# **DEATHWATCH**

Mysterious figures who battle in black power armor, fighting with preternatural skill and dedication against the most terrible of alien creatures. Appearing without warning and vanishing as quickly as they arrived, leaving no trace of themselves or of the creatures they have fought. These are the Imperium's most highly trained xenos fighters, known simply as the Deathwatch.

Forming the chamber militant of Ordo Xenos, the Deathwatch uniquely draws its members from across the many different Space Marine Chapters, all of which have sworn sacred oaths to maintain specially trained xenos fighters and stand ready to deploy them at a moment's notice. These specialised warriors are drawn together as and when needed by the Ordo to combat alien menace whenever and wherever it rears its vile head.

Rumour has it that Ordo Xenos maintains a number of secret fortresses at the fringes of the Imperium where the Deathwatch keeps a silent and constant vigil, ever watchful for the tell-tale signs of alien encroachment.

# **SUPERSTITION & FAITH**

*"Thought for the day: Blind faith is a just cause." — Liber Imperialis*.

T The weapons of war may do much to guard the Imperium from the threats that assail it. Yet the strongest armor is not forged from ceramite, it is formed of faith.

# **THE CULT OF THE EMPEROR**

The Cult Imperialis is one of the few common factors that link the disparate worlds of the Imperium together. No matter what conditions prevail upon a world within the Imperium, the Imperial cult will be found there.

The ways in which the Emperor is worshipped are multitudinous. To some He is revered as a distant, patriarchal and human figure. Others identify Him with some aspect of nature, many others, such as the primitive Epheisians of Dwimlicht, regard Him as a star-god, for His agents only visit occasionally and they descend from the heavens when they do so. But all the creeds of the cult agree upon this one thing: there is only one Emperor. To worship a pantheon of gods and put other gods alongside Him is heresy. However, there have been many individuals over the millennia who have been seen as His saints, people visibly touched by the Emperor, and they are venerated all over the Imperium. There are saints for every aspect of life and there is a thriving trade in their relics on many worlds.

The worship of the Emperor is, in the main, highly organised. Cathedral complexes can be found in the capitals of all worlds of any meaningful populations. On the densely populated, teeming hive worlds, these can occupy entire spires. The graceful structure of the Emperor Triumphant, constructed after the Second Armageddon war at Hive Primus on Armageddon, climbs delicately skyward, its main tower nearly a full kilometre in height. The statue of the Emperor at the top brushes the troposphere, looking benignly down upon the seething, polluted world below. Most towns will have a church or temple to the Emperor and even the crudest village of the most primitive tribesman will sport a sacred cave or grove dedicated to his name.

Of course, in some places, the worship of the Emperor supercedes all other aspects of life—these are the shrine worlds of the Imperium, where perhaps one of the great saints, or even, in the distant past, the Emperor Himself, performed a great deed. These planets can be one, vast, religious complex, or huge cemetery worlds such as Granithor, where the wealthy spend vast fortunes bringing the dead scions of their families for burial, usually those who have perished in the service of the Emperor. Then there are the cardinal worlds, which attract millions of pilgrims and are the strongholds of the cult. These planets are directly governed by the Ecclesiarchy and are the seats of functionaries high in the Cult, responsible for the spiritual health of vast areas of space.

The Ecclesiarchy maintains and promotes the cult galaxy-wide and, where possible, tries to sanction the worship of the Emperor no matter how bizarre it may seem. Very few practices are proscribed, and even such abominations as human sacrifice to the Emperor are useful to the Imperium, for it is easy to convince a newly encountered culture that approves of such custom to give up its psykers to the Black Ships.

One of the Ecclesiarchy's tasks is to record this multiplicity of tradition with which the Emperor is honoured. In that way, two preachers from opposite sides of the galaxy will know, no matter what their title or manner of expressing their devotion might be, that neither is a heretic. The Ecclesiarchy sends out mission fleets for precisely this purpose, whose flotillas of blessed spacecraft slowly circle a particular part of the galaxy, recording new variants of the cult, correcting serious heresies and proselytising to newly discovered populations of humans.

To all, the Emperor is a living god. He may be tens of thousands of light years away, but that He exists, the inhabitants of the Imperium know, so faith is an easy thing. Some amongst the Ecclesiarchy and Inquisition may argue that men should be more ardent in their devotion to Him, but though some may be lax in their adulation and may blaspheme or heretically curse the Master of Mankind for their lot, it is nevertheless rare to meet a man who would dare to deny the Emperor's divinity.

# Preachers & Confessors

The Ecclesiarchy presides over the souls of the Imperium's citizens, dividing its countless diocese into parishes, some of which are centred upon a particular planet, others focused to tending to a particular locale or holy shrine. Each parish is ministered by a preacher, seeing to the well-being and purity of his flock souls. It is their duty to watch for deviancy and ensure that heretical belief is purged wherever found 's A truly pious preacher may rise to become a pontifex . , whose authority extends over several parishes and preachers. The responsibilities of a pontifex are diverse and can encompass the protection and ministration of routes of pilgrimage, the consideration of beatitudes and recommendation of canonisation to the holy synods Confessors are the booming voices of the Ecclesiarchy . , exalting the faithful to deeds of penitence righteousness. , fervour and Confessors are not charged with the ministrations of a diocese, but rather roam the Imperium

# **THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE**

Technology and its mysteries are the preserve of the followers of the Machine God, the Tech-Priests. For they believe that machines are imbued with a life-force of their own, a soul granted to them by the Machine God—a will and a personality. The more ancient a piece of technology, the greater reverence it will elicit from these robed followers, who will spend many hours anointing a machine with the correct unguents before pressing the sigils of activation to coax its spirit into life.

A machine that is both old and complicated is given the same status by the Tech-Priests as the Ecclesiarchy would give a major saint, for many of the systems on these machines are irreplaceable, their secrets lost to time. Among the greatest of such machines are the vast battleships of the Imperial Navy, or the super-heavy Titan war machines. But the Tech-Priests will also lavish their attention upon an antique lasgun or prognosticator and will spend much time trying to understand the intricacies of a device's workings. All machines though, no matter what their pedigree, are treated as living things by the Tech-Priests and they will treat all with reverence, for all are gifts from the long-lost past, knowledge of their function handed on through time only by the beneficence of the Machine God. Woe betide any man who fails to treat his weapon with respect or hurls abuses at his desktop logicator within the range of the machine enhanced senses of a Tech-Priest.

Paradoxically, true machine intelligences are held to be anathema by the Tech-Priests, for they view these as soulless automata, spiritless things cast into the galaxy to confound the will of the Machine God. Shrouded in myth and legend, these abominations are rumoured to have originated during the Dark Age of Technology. Supposedly pathologically dangerous, an Inquisitor may encounter them, although rarely, in the course of his duties. Should they learn of these creations, the Tech-Priests will hunt them down, investigate them and then destroy them. Only properly sanctioned logic engines, those deemed to have a spirit gifted them by the Omnissiah, are allowed to persist.
