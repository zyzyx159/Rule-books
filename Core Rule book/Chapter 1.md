# <span id="page-12-0"></span>Chapter 1: Character Creation

*"What is your duty? To look the universe in the face and then spit in its eye. To die with a curse on your lips and your finger on the trigger. To know that you are doomed, but try anyway."* — Inquisitor Soldevan, Ordo Hereticus.

In Dark Heresy, you take the role of an Acolyte, a trainee investigator in the service of a powerful Inquisitor. You, out of the countless billions, have been chosen to play a part in a war so great and terrible that ordinary men must never learn its secrets. Your master will task you with all manner of missions, in which you will encounter witches, aliens and even Daemons. You will be tempted with power and exposed to corruption. You, your allies or even your master may fall under the thrall of the Dark Gods. Should this happen, it will be your duty to purge with fire and righteousness, for the Ruinous Ones, the Chaos Powers, are insidious in their evil and would destroy you and all of mankind if they could.

You and your fellow Acolytes must struggle to hold back the many threats that face humanity. You must do this knowing that your name will never be recorded in the annals of history. Power, fame and grandeur shall never be yours but you do not fight for these things. You fight because you must. You fight because failure will mean the destruction of the Imperium… the destruction of all mankind.

It's not going to be easy. In the earliest stages, you are little better than anyone else of the 41st Millennium. You are merely one of the many scores of Acolytes recruited into the Inquisition. You'll need to use your wits, luck and the skills of your companions to the best of your abilities if you are to survive. The longer you last and the stronger you become, the greater the foes you will be asked to face. The war for the soul of mankind is unending, and even should you live long enough to become an Inquisitor, you will never know peace until the cold embrace of death.

When you die, you will not be missed, but then mere glory never made heroes. Your struggle, your triumph, your failure—these are the things that matter. They matter because, Emperor willing, you will have made a difference, however small. In the 41st Millennium, that is the greatest legacy a man may dare hope for.

# Creating your Acolyte Creating your Acolyte

*"You are not required to think, only to act!"* — Cadet Commissar, Jourian Eutar.

To get started on your mission, you need to make your alter ego, known as a Player Character (PC). Creating your Player Character is a simple process that many people find fun in itself. As you move through this chapter, you will find the tools to construct an interesting persona with a history, motivations and a clear idea about what the future will hold. Be aware, there may be unfamiliar terms, places and concepts within this chapter, but have no fear all will be explained as you explore the rest of this rule book and learn of the Dark Heresy.

Before you get started, you will need to gather some supplies. You will require two ten-sided dice (or 2d10 as they will be referred to throughout the rules), a character sheet, a pencil and an eraser. It is best to write everything in pencil to start with, as you may end up changing or adding to things as you go along. You may like to have some spare scraps of paper to make notes. It is also useful to get together with the group of people you'll be playing with when you make your PC. Not only is it more fun to compare things as you go along, you will also be able to make sure that your characters all complement one another.

There are six steps you should follow whenever you are creating a new Acolyte. Each step is relatively simple, consisting of making a few choices and recording your selections onto your character sheet. Each stage in the character creation process is as follows.

# **Stage One: Home World**

The very first step in creating your character is to determine your Home World. The Imperium is a vast place, filled with innumerable worlds, cultures and civilisations. Dark Heresy contains four broad Home World archetypes common to the Calixis Sector: Feral World, Hive World, Imperial World and Void Born. Your Home World says a lot about you, where you came from, what you may look like, your mannerisms and your perspective on dealing with others.

# **Stage Two: Generate Characteristics**

Many of the key things about your character are defined in terms of numbers. These are called Characteristics. They represent your Acolyte's capabilities, ranging from physical Characteristics such as Strength and Toughness, to mental ones like Intelligence and Willpower.

# **Stage Three: Determine Career Path**

While your Home World and Characteristics are important for understanding your character, it is your Career Path that defines your character's function within the game. Dark Heresy has eight Career Paths: Adept, Arbitrator, Assassin, Cleric, Guardsman, Imperial Psyker, Scum and Tech-Priest. As you play the game, your Rank within your Career Path will increase. This opens doors to a host of new options, giving you the means to customize your Acolyte.

# **Stage Four: Spend Experience Points, Buy Equipment**

This is where you can further customize your Acolyte. All characters begin play with an amount of Experience Points (xp) to reflect their lives prior to serving an Inquisitor. You may spend your starting experience to purchase new Skills and Talents or improve your Characteristics. See **Chapter II: Career Paths** for details.

Acolytes also receive some starting money, which you can use to buy additional weapons, armor and equipment from **Chapter V: armory** for your character should you so choose.

This is also the point where you add Fate Points and Wounds.

# **Stage Five: Bringing your Character to Life**

Once all the numbers are finished with, it is time to flesh out your Acolyte. This stage helps you define your character's appearance, their past, temperaments, beliefs and more. This is an important step as it helps you portray the character during game play and makes your Acolyte a unique being, helping to set him apart from others who may fill a similar niche.

# **Stage Six: Play Dark Heresy**

With all of this complete, you are now ready to play Dark Heresy!

# Stage One: Home world

*"Your home is no longer a place, but a people. The Imperium is yours, and you are the Imperium's."*

— Catechism of the Founding, Gunmetallicus 104th.

Y Your Dark Heresy character may work for the Inquisition now, but that was not always the case. The type of world a character grew up on affects many things about them, from their physical abilities, skills and temperament to their appearance and the Career Paths they may choose. If you have an idea about the type of character you would like to play, you may select a Home World from any of the types described on **Table 1-1: Random Home World**. Otherwise, feel free to roll the dice and see what the Emperor has chosen for you.

# Table 1–1: Random Home World  **Roll Result**

### **(D100)**

- **01–20 Feral World:** Feral worlders are big, strong and tough—perfect if you want to play a character that is good at fighting.
- **21–45 Hive World:** Hivers are fast-talking, quick thinking individuals, perfect if you want to play a character who can bluff their way out of anything.
- **46–90 Imperial World:** Imperial citizens come from all sorts of different planets and cultures, so make great characters if you want to play someone who is a good all-rounder. Imperial citizens have the widest choice of careers available to them.
- 9**1–00 Void Born:** Void Born are weirdly lucky and strong willed—perfect if you want to play a psyker or scholastic character.

When you have chosen your Home World, note down your starting Skills and Traits on your character sheet and move on to the next stage.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>Feral World **FERAL WORLD**

*"Most of your life has been spent among your people on a harsh feral world, where strength, courage and martial skill are valued above all else. You are big, strong and brave, but also superstitious. You almost certainly belonged to a warrior clan, and you are valued for your skill in battle."*

Feral worlds are tough places in which to survive. Whether living in a steaming death-filled jungle or upon the burning sands of a desert planet, man has reverted to a more primitive existence, living in tribes, gangs or creeds without much care for technology or the soft living ways of the so-called "civilized folk".

# **Life on a Feral World**

Feral worlds are among the most primitive of populated planets in the Imperium, partly due to the environment and partly because they have long been out of touch with the rest of the Imperium. These planets often have a technological base that is pre-black powder, even Stone Age in the most backward cases, and the inhabitants have often descended into savagery. When a feral world lies in a war-zone, the Imperial Guard may supplement the natives' armaments and train them in the use of lasguns, heavy stubbers and the like. Despite a rudimentary knowledge of such weapons, the feral worlders have no concept of how to manufacture or maintain them.

Some feral worlds are planets that are simply too dangerous to support widespread human settlement. These death worlds vary a great deal in type. Some may be covered in jungles, which harbor man-eating plants and fearsome carnivorous animals, or barren rock-scapes strewn with volcanoes and wracked by nuclear storms. Some lie close to a sun and mostly consist of parched deserts, which are sometimes home to small tribes of nomadic humans. Conversely, some worlds are covered largely in ice and arctic tundra, utterly inhospitable and inhabited only by the most resilient humans. Death worlds are almost impossible to colonize, but are often explored as they can harbor rich minerals, gas deposits or other attractive resources.

human settlers in these places, though uncommon, can take several forms. They could be remnants of an ancient colony, long since fallen into ruin. Perhaps they are the researchers and Imperial Guardsmen from an outpost gone feral, or perhaps the descendants of stranded spacefarers who have been forced to survive generations of terrible hardship. Whatever the case, feral worlders are likely to be primitive headhunters, beast-hunting nomads, ax-wielding barbarians or other such folk.

Like all worlds brought back into the bosom of the Emperor's rule, feral worlds are controlled by a planetary governor. In many cases, this ruler governs his planet from orbit, travelling to the surface only to establish purges of psychic talent and mutation. Religious deviancy is rife on feral worlds, especially amongst the warrior cults, and vigilance is a necessity. However, governors in charge of feral worlds are often under close scrutiny, frequently under suspicion of "going native". With some feral world tribes, people cling to the belief in deities other than the Emperor. These have often been modified by the Ecclesiarchy, or just brutally stamped out. Heretical cults are constantly hunted down by the authorities and feral worlds are a haven for such heretics.

# **Feral World Careers**

Characters from feral worlds may take the following Career Paths:

### **Assassin**

Feral world Assassins are usually plucked from their home world at a young age by Death Cults or Assassinorum schools. They soon begin a savage training regime which thins out the unworthy. Learning the art of the kill, they become fierce and merciless Assassins, much in demand on many worlds. Inured to pain and accustomed to death, they are deadly in the extreme.

# **Guardsman**

Feral world Guardsmen are usually tribal warriors tithed to the Imperial Guard by the elders of their particular clan. They are sometimes trained en mass in vast drill camps or ship holds, whilst others are merely shown a lasgun and trusted to get on with it. Also, there are those instructed by members of their tribe, using rote-learned rites and religious rituals. They make tough and dedicated warriors—perfect for protecting a cadre of Acolytes.

# **Imperial Psyker**

Imperial Psykers from feral worlds were once the shamans, witch doctors or cunning folk of their clan. Their talent is such that they have been sought out and taken away for sanction by the agents of the Black Ships of the Inquisition. They wield strange powers, from healing charms to deadly, unstoppable hexes. Some peer into entrails to perceive the future, whilst others can create blight dolls to strike down their foes. They are naturally tough and hard to kill, which can be both a blessing and a curse.

# **Scum**

Feral world Scum are the scavengers and survivors of their peoples. Some hang around colonies and outposts, thereby becoming semi-civilized, whilst others have come from post-apocalyptic worlds where theft and gang warfare are the norm. Adept at thievery and tricks, they manage to survive by using a combination of wits, light fingers and barefaced cheek.

The inhabitants of feral worlds are strong, hardy people, who disdain weakness and often band together in tribal warrior clans. The survivalist mentality and physical prowess of feral worlders makes these planets good recruiting grounds for the Imperial Guard or even the Space Marines. Sometimes, removing a feral worlder from their familiar environment will be an unnerving experience for them, and their primitive mind will be unable to cope with the knowledge of basic concepts such as space travel. In these instances, madness ensues and the poor feral worlder must either be imprisoned or put out of his misery. Even those who make it into the wider Imperium retain many of their tribal traits and traditions. Sometimes this can be incredibly useful—the Catachan jungle fighters or the Space Wolves of Fenris are prime examples—but sometimes these traditions can appear to be strange affectations or social hindrances, such as an insistence on wearing the bones of dead comrades in battle, spitting whenever a psyker uses his powers, or applying war paint before a mission.

# **Feral World PCs**

Feral World characters are those who have made it off world and remained sane—for the most part. They are robust, straightforward characters, most usually following the Guardsman career, and they excel at close combat due to their size and strength. However, feral worlders are uncomfortable in any strange situation, and do not react well to psychic phenomena, extremes of technological accomplishment or the polite society of the Imperial nobility. They are born to fight and to survive, and they do it well.

# **Feral Worlder Skills**

All feral worlders can converse in their regional tongue, unique to their world of origin. Feral worlders gain the Speak Language (Tribal Dialect) (Int) skill.

# **Feral Worlder Traits**

Feral worlders gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

# **Iron Stomach**

Food is often scarce on feral worlds and those born on such worlds learn to set aside their revulsion and eat whatever they must to survive.

**Benefit:** You gain a +10 bonus to Carouse Skill Tests made to resist the effects of ingested toxins, poison or tainted foods. This bonus applies to Tests made to consume unusual or unpleasant meals—rotting meat, Grox testes, corpse starch rations, to name a few—as well as Tests made to resist throwing up.

## **Primitive**

Feral worlders have no time for the mysteries of technology or the rubbishy constraints of etiquette and social niceties. **Penalty:** You take a –10 penalty on Tech-Use (Int) Tests and a –10 penalty to Fellowship Tests made in formal or civilized surroundings.

# **Rite of Passage**

Life is harsh for a feral worlder, and blood spills all too frequently. Whether through surviving a brutal initiation ritual or through tribal teachings, feral worlders are adept at tending bleeding wounds.

**Benefit:** You may spend a Full Action to make an Intelligence Test to staunch Blood Loss (see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**). This is a Full Action. On a success, you manage to stop the bleeding.

### **Wilderness Savvy**

Feral worlders are accustomed to hunting their own food. **Benefit:** Navigation (Surface) (Int), Survival (Int) and Tracking (Int) count as Basic Skills for feral worlders.

# **HIVE WORLD**

*"The great hives are not like other worlds in the Imperium, and you are not like the common man. Technology has surrounded you all your life, and you find its rarity elsewhere bemusing. You are an adventurer, an opportunist—more inquisitive than your fellows and certainly quicker on the draw!"*

Hive worlds are home to countless teeming millions. The population is so dense that frequently the entire surface of the world is covered with enormous cities stretching from horizon to horizon. Many hivers labor in thankless obscurity, manning huge factories that churn out endless streams of weapons, chemicals or other vital goods. Others run with violent gangs in the dark of the under hives, living off their wits, guts and firepower.

# **Life on a Hive World**

Hive worlds are vital to the welfare of the Imperium. They are industrial worlds, producing munitions for the Emperor's armies in vast factories, mining valuable minerals and refining fuel for the Imperial fleet.

These planets are usually barren and hostile with the much of the hive world's surface inhospitable, sometimes deadly to human life after centuries of pollution. The hives themselves are astonishingly large—massive urban conglomerations, spires of adamantium and rockcrete that can cover continents and stretch for miles into the sky. Each hive houses millions, even billions, of Imperial citizens, and is a nation in its own right, with noble houses ruling mini-empires, trading and sometimes fighting with other hives.

Palls of thick, acrid smoke cling to the lower portions of the hives below the upper sections—those gleaming spires that rise above the cloud cover. Only the wealthy can afford to live in the upper sections of a hive, and the working classes never see the light of the sun. Within the spires reside the noble houses—decadent, wealthy members of great Imperial families, or the richest merchant overlords. Spires contain broad, airy spaces and splendours unimaginable to those who dwell in the darkness below.

Below the spires, heavy gateways and security patrols regulate passage between the upper levels and the rest of the hive. Beyond this point lies the vast bulk of the working hive—the hive-city. The populations are often so large as to be unmanageable, and the hives rely on constant recycling and imports to provide food

# **Hive World Careers**

Characters from hive worlds can take the following Career Paths:

# **Arbitrator**

Hive world Arbitrators are usually skilled riot officers, adept at beating down uprisings and sedition in the tightly packed corridors of the hive. They may come from a family of traditional law keepers, or perhaps they joined out of a sense of hivic duty. Whatever the case, they learn to bring justice to those that would threaten the order of the Imperium.

# **Assassin**

Hive world Assassins are usually prowling bounty hunters, skilled in finding and destroying their man. They might be hired by rivals to settle a difficult gang war or end a competing trade house. Others move amongst the glittering spire nobility, sowing poison and death in their wake—a deadly instrument in the cut-and-thrust world of politics.

# **Cleric**

Hive world Clerics usually minister to the toiling masses of the middle hive, exhorting them to ever greater works in the Emperor's name. Others may tend to the spiritual needs of the upper classes, or even seek to save the souls of gang scum deep in the bowels of the hive.

# **Guardsman**

Hive world Guardsmen are often from the ranks of the hive militia or Imperial Guard tithe—trained troops who act to defend the hive against rival cities, attacks by out-wall savages or internal strife. Others are "Privates", foot soldiers drawn from the ranks of the personal armies controlled by nobles or trade houses. Others still are brutal gangers, adept at dealing death and defending their gang territory.

# **Imperial Psyker**

Hive world psykers are usually plucked from their birth class and dragged into the service of the nobility. Many endure a life of indentured servitude, truthsaying business dealings or reading fortunes for fashionable noble matrons. Others are recruited to dampen the psychic resonance of the millions of souls packed within the metal skin of the hive. Some soothe and numb the workers, whilst others hunt out the seditious, mutated or secretly psychic.

# **Scum**

Hive world Scum are usually of the downtrodden lower classes of the hive. Some are vicious gangers, ready to murder at a moment's notice, whilst others are petty thieves and cretescreevers. Some may be middle hivers living a life outside the norm, whilst a rare few might be the children of noble families, driven to a life of disrepute by scandal, disinheritance or boredom. Whatever the case, they possess a reckless disregard for authority and law, living by theft, lies and chicanery.

# **Tech-Priest**

Hive world Tech-Priests are usually recruited from hereditary castes dedicated to maintaining the fabric of the hive itself. Many Tech-Priests view other hivers as little more than organic components in the glorious machine-spirit of the city. Others delve into the deep and forgotten places to seek out the lost secrets of the hive's origins.

and basic materials for the teeming masses. For most people, life in the hives is tough. Conditions are squalid and unsanitary. The very air breathed by the countless hivers is recycled from the spire above and pumped through the rest, growing ever more bitter and poisonous the further down it filters. Even the water is distilled from the discharge of the upper hive, and food is factoryproduced, sometimes algae-based or spun from corpse starch. Pollution and overcrowding are the least of the hivers' worries, as gang violence and outright anarchy is part of everyday life, particularly in the lower levels. Most hivers know only their own hive-city and do not leave it during their lifetime. They never see the sky or set foot on the surface of their own planet. Their life is one of servitude in a manufactorum, coupled with a struggle for survival in the increasingly crime ridden hab-levels. Those few that do manage to leave the hives are often of a nervous disposition, and suffer terribly from agoraphobia.

Beneath the hive-city is a lawless frontier known as the underhive. These underhives are creations of catastrophe—explosions, water pollution, power failure and collapsing access tunnels are common occurrences in the lowest parts of the hive-cities. Sometimes the damage is repaired, but more often than not the appeals of the refugees fall on deaf ears and the underhive expands. In this area, normal habitation is impossible, but the underhive still serves as a refuge for hive scum, outlaws and the mentally unstable, though in some rare instances entire sub cultures manage to develop and subsist in this inhospitable realm. It is a region outside the formal social structure of the hive, though some people are forced to live there as entire levels are accidentally cut off from the hive-city. Heavily barricaded settlements form the only havens of order in the underhive, though even here the law of the gun is the only recognised authority, and those who go unarmed are rare.

Underhives are frontiers in more ways than one, and are often seen as a necessary evil. They separate the hive-city from the hive bottom—a desolate, polluted waste, long since abandoned, and partially flooded by centuries of effluence and industrial waste. In the hive bottom, the only living things are the most monstrous mutants. Sometimes these foul creatures find their way into the underhive, and in a hive-city, parents scare their children with stories of sump spawn and plague zombies. Minor mutation is common in the underhive and is often overlooked by the desperadoes who reside there. However, sometimes fanatical cults, such as the Redemptionists, launch one of their crusades into the underhive to cleanse it of mutants. Some are never seen again.

# **Hive World PCs**

Not all hivers are content to serve their world in the timeless fashion: some dream of better lives, driven by a desire for wealth, freedom, power or adventure, or just the urge to escape bludgeoning poverty. You are one such hiver—a young adventurer, willing to chance all for a taste of wealth, prestige and power. Hivers are resourceful and quick-witted, more likely to rely on gadgets and fast-talking than outright confrontation.

# **Hive Worlder Skills**

All hive worlders can converse in the common cant of their home, each one unique to their hive of origin. Hive worlders gain the Speak Language (Hive Dialect) (Int) skill.

# **Hive Worlder Traits**

Hive worlders gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Accustomed to Crowds**

Hivers grow up surrounded by immense herds of humanity. They are used to weaving through even the densest mob with ease.

**Benefit:** Crowds do not count as Difficult Terrain for hivers, and when Running or Charging through a dense crowd, hivers take no penalty to the Agility Test to keep their feet.

### **Caves of Steel**

To a hiver, surrounded at all times by metal, machinery and industry, the arcane mysteries of technology are not so strange. **Benefit:** Hivers treat the Tech-Use (Int) skill as a Basic Skill.

### **Hive bound**

Hivers seldom endure the horrors of the open sky or the indignity of the great outdoors.

**Penalty:** Hivers take a -10 penalty to all Survival (Int) Tests, and while out of a "proper hab" (e.g. places without manufactured goods, solid ceilings and electrical power) the hiver takes a –5 penalty to all Intelligence Tests.

#### **Wary**

Hivers are constantly alert for the first hint of trouble, be it a gang shoot-out, hab riot, or hivequake.

**Benefit:** All hivers gain a +1 bonus to Initiative rolls.

# Imperial World

*"You hail from an Imperial world, one of a million planets united by a belief in the immortal Emperor. Soldier, fanatic, thief, mercenary, noble: these are some of your many possible backgrounds. Whatever your previous calling, you are now in the employ of the Inquisition, and your adventure has only just begun…"*

A bewildering variety of worlds are known to the Imperium. From hyper-technological democratic societies to drudging medieval worlds, many planets offer their fealty and devotion to the immortal God-Emperor of Man.

# **Life on an Imperial World**

The Imperium covers such an utterly vast area of the galaxy that it is almost impossible to conjure an image of a "typical" Imperial world. In truth, no such thing exists. Amongst the million worlds of man, there is endless variety. Agri-worlds, for instance, are little more than vast farms, producing food for the good of the Imperium. Similarly, mining worlds produce ore and raw mineral for use in the vast factories of the forge worlds. Cardinal worlds are ruled by the Ministorum and are given over entirely to the Priesthood of the Imperium—the mysterious Ecclesiarchy. Stranger still are the garden worlds, which serve as havens for Imperial nobles. Paradise, however, comes at a price, for temptation and heresy may be rife in these places. Some Imperial worlds are utterly remote, having had no contact with the rest of humanity for centuries. As a result, cultural and societal diversity is to be expected from planet to planet, sometimes even within the same solar system.

The closer a world lies to Holy Terra—the home planet of mankind—the more important, advanced and well governed it is likely to be. Those far-flung planets on the fringes, on the other hand, are likely to be frontier worlds, left to their own devices for much of the time, and lying under the constant threat of attack, both physically and spiritually. Many worlds have a technological base akin to Holy Terra, while many more have devolved into

# **Imperial World Careers**

Characters from Imperial worlds can take any of the following Career Paths:

### **Adept**

Imperial Adepts are the civil servants that run the Empire of Man: the Administratum. They ceaselessly work to record and archive the workings of the Emperor's dominion with nearly all information passing through their ink-stained fingers. Whether interpreting ancient tomes of lore, stamping Imperial Tithe orders or sending fleets to war, they administrate the vastest Empire mankind has ever known.

### **Arbitrator**

Imperial Arbitrators are tasked with defending the rule of the Imperium. They might be part of an Adeptus Arbites precinct on some technocratic capital, or a law keeper upon an emerging colony world. Others still are stationed upon shrine worlds to watch for signs of Ecclesiarchy schism, whilst others itch for action upon peaceful paradise worlds.

### **Assassin**

Imperial Assassins are often members of a minor death cult or else professional killers. Some may hunt criminals for money, whilst others may act for powerful nobles or even governments. Indeed, some are products of planetary or Imperium controlled Assassinorum schools, whilst others have merely found themselves as accomplished executioners due to war, persecution or other circumstances.

# **Cleric**

Imperial Clerics are valued members of the Ecclesiarchy. They might hail from a shrine world or minister to the peoples of an agri-world. Some might be the orphans of war heroes, raised by the Ecclesiarchy to be fanatically loyal servants of the Emperor. Some work amidst the blood and gunfire of the battlefield, whilst others may seek to raise the spirits of frontier world colonists in the face of terrible hardships and ravening xenos.

# **Guardsman**

Imperial world Guardsmen are usually warriors and troopers tithed to the Imperial Guard. Given up as part of their home world's obligation to the Emperor, these Acolytes have been trained and equipped with the best their world had to offer. Other Guardsmen may have been seconded from mercenary or private armies controlled by the rich and powerful.

# **Imperial Psyker**

Psykers from Imperial worlds are sanctioned by the Throne of Terra, thereby gaining some measure of respectability and acceptance. Most are servants of some Imperial institution, camouflaged behind scholastic-seeming titles and almost Ecclesiastical robes. Largely indistinguishable from their fellow adepts, they advise, investigate and serve the Imperium as best they may. Their superiors, meanwhile, watch them closely for signs of corruption or betrayal.

## **Scum**

Imperial Scum are the smugglers, thieves, deserters and desperados of the Imperium. Some hail from rogue worlds, where there is no government or law, whilst others have been plucked from the penal legions for their dubious skills. Many prey like parasites upon the society of their planet, perhaps trading in forbidden materials, or siphoning off food supplies.

# **Tech-Priest**

Imperial Tech-Priests are often the children of a forge world. Some are brought up to be part of the Adeptus Mechanicus, whilst others join due to natural skill. They attend the rites of technology for their world, be it tending the harvester machines, spaceport cogitators, governmental vox mechanisms or colonial mining gear. Some do little more than contemplate the ancient Standard Template Constructs, whilst others actively search them out.

feudal backwaters with little more than black powder technology. Such worlds make excellent recruiting grounds for the Imperial Guard, the Space Marines and the Inquisition, as nothing assures obedience quite so well as fear. Upon such planets, the Imperial Cult is surrounded by an atmosphere of superstition, demanding fealty to the immortal God-Emperor who, for many citizens of the Imperium, is so distant as to be little more than a myth.

Most major scientific advances in the Imperium come from the rediscovery of forgotten secrets from the Dark Age of Technology. The reliance on these ancient templates creates a mishmash of tech-use on many worlds. For example, it is possible for a planet's industry to rely on gigantic steam-powered monorails for long-distance transport, yet still be unable to produce smaller versions of these aged devices, resorting instead to horse-drawn carts for commuting. Governmental organisation is equally as varied. Most Imperial worlds are ruled by a planetary governor, who assumes absolute control either by birthright or by election. The nobility frequently assume all positions of power and privilege on a planet, while the lower echelons of the class structure comprise workers, militia, fanatics, slaves and dregs. While many planets are free of the levels of scum that infest hive worlds, those closer to the Emperor's grace harbor countless numbers of crazed individuals workers who have lost their place in a zero-tolerance society, or who have realised that the galaxy is not only unimaginably vast, but full of hate and hostility towards mankind. Such realisation often leads to paranoia or outright insanity, and Imperial worlds are rife with broken individuals, prophets of doom, criminals and gutter-trash.

The waifs and strays of society, however, also serve their purpose. The millions of orphans produced by constant warfare, within and without, are taken in by the Schola Progenium. Many Imperial Worlds are pocked with vast orphanages, where the strict drill-abbots of the Ecclesiarchy produce faithful servants of the Emperor. Those of noble blood may become officers in the Imperial Navy, or even commissars, while the rest will undoubtedly find employment with the Ministorum, the Adeptus Terra or one of the Emperor's armies.

With religion, superstition and fear dominating so much of society within the Imperium, deviancy is rarely tolerated. People place their faith in good, honest hatred to guard them against the manifold horrors of the universe. Man swarms in vast numbers working, praying, eating and sleeping in an endless cycle, each soul forming a faceless cog in the endless grinding machinery of the Imperium. Law and order within society is often kept by the Adeptus Arbites. Sometimes, however, more remote worlds employ civil militias instead. On such planets, mercenaries sometimes even off-worlders—are hired to bulk out the standing garrisons that not only provide domestic security, but also form part of the Imperial Guard. If a world lies within a war zone, then often these fighters are the only thing that stand in the way of the destruction of an entire world.

# **Imperial World PCs**

To have broken away from the dogmatic constraints of Imperial life, your character must either be of exceptional spirit or have real potential. Perhaps you are an adventurer or soldier, or a true believer beginning a long pilgrimage to prove your faith; maybe you are a mercenary, brought in to defend a planet during wartime. You have undoubtedly seen conflict, madness or perhaps even heresy, and now, for whatever reason, you are embarking into the unknown in the name of the Emperor.

# **Imperial Worlder Traits**

Imperial worlders gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

### **Blessed Ignorance**

Imperial citizens know that the proper ways of living are those that are tried and tested by the generations that have gone before. Horror, pain and death are the just rewards of curiosity, for those that look too deeply into the mysteries of the universe are all too likely to find malefic beings looking back at them.

**Penalty:** Your wise blindness imposes a –5 penalty on Forbidden Lore (Int) Tests.

### **Hagiography**

Meditation upon the lives–and, more importantly, deaths of the Emperor's blessed saints grants Imperial citizens a wide knowledge of the Imperium of Man.

**Benefit:** Imperial worlders treat the Common Lore (Imperial Creed) (Int), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), and Common Lore (War) (Int) skills as Basic Skills.

### **Liturgical Familiarity**

Surrounded as they are by folk of the faith, Imperial citizens are accustomed to the preaching of the Ecclesiarchy.

**Benefit:** Imperial world characters treat Literacy (Int) and Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int) as Basic Skills.

### **Superior Origins**

Imperial citizens know that of all the worlds in the Imperium, theirs is, in fact, the most beloved of the Emperor. **Benefit:** Increase your Willpower by +3.

# Void Born **VOID BORN**

*"You were not born on one of the Emperor's worlds, but instead on a vast ship in the depths of space–perhaps even in the warp itself. Why this sets you apart from your fellow man is unknown, but the way you look, act and think is somehow different. You have been raised in the company of psykers, and what other men fear or loathe is commonplace to you."*

Born out in the darkness between the stars, the void born are an odd collection of misfits, strangers and ill-omened folk. Perhaps birthed in the belly of a pilgrimage ship, or aboard an ancient orbital satellite, these people are often considered to be somehow touched by the taint of the warp.

# **Life as a Void Born**

The Imperial fleet is a vital factor in the maintenance of the Imperium; without it human worlds would be isolated from each other and from the protection of the Imperium. Trade could not exist, weapons could not reach the Emperor's armies and world after world would grind to a halt.

Space travel throughout the Imperium is dangerous and arduous. Most interstellar travel is undertaken using powerful warp engines. Within the warp, a ship can cover many thousands of light years within a relatively short time, dropping back into real space far beyond its starting point. Some parts of the warp, however, act as power vortices sucking helpless spacecraft to their doom. There is also the constant danger of turbulence, warp storms and loops. Ships can be sent thousands of light years off course, or trapped in stasis forever. In the warp there is no time and distance only the constantly flowing stream of the immaterium. On board a ship in the warp, a single month of perceived time may pass, yet in the material realm anything from six months to several years may elapse. Fleets responding to distress calls, or supply vessels on long voyages, have been known to arrive months or even years too late.

# **Void Born Careers**

Void born characters can take any of the following Career Paths:

# **Adept**

Void born Adepts are often part of the adminisphere of the ship, acting to serve the officer caste by analysing data, attending the Navigators, recording the contents of various holds and so on. Others are tasked with more bizarre duties, such as keeping accurate maps of the vessel, preserving the integrity of the ship's bloodlines or engraving the names of every crew member into the hull of the craft.

# **Arbitrator**

Void born Arbitrators stride the corridors of the ship ever alert for trouble and sedition. Some work at the behest of the captain, watching for signs of witchery and rebellion in the crew. Others maintain close links with the Adeptus Arbites, and instead watch the officers for signs of corruption.

# **Assassin**

Void born Assassins frequently take orders from the high-ranking officers of the ship. These Assassins kill off troublemakers and suspected cult leaders before any corruption or sedition can spread through the ship. Others are members of strange death cults, mandated by the enginseers, plucking their victims seemingly at random to offer up to the Emperor.

# **Cleric**

Void born Clerics often act as padre to the lower orders of the ship, walking the bunk-holds offering confession to the sleepless, or screaming blessings amidst the crash and thunder of the gun deck. Some lead choirs of bilge-scrubbers in litanies against the warp, whilst others ensure the Emperor icons are properly adored. Others act as spiritual advisors to the captain, while others still are part of the officer class.

# **Imperial Psyker**

Void born psykers are prized and feared members of the crew. Some are employed to detect emerging psykers within the crew, hunting them out before they can become prey to some malefic horror of the warp. Others act to maintain defences against such intrusion, whilst others bleed out portions of their soul to aid the ships' Navigators, and some are trained to receive astropathic communications. Whatever their role, they are watched closely by everyone aboard their ship.

# **Scum**

Void born Scum are the misbegotten and outcast members of the crew, perhaps spawned through some forbidden inter-caste liaison or maybe from a traditional class of untouchables. Whatever the case, void born Scum drive and control the black market aboard ship and are adept at scrounging, stealing or concocting all manner of illicit treats—from alcohol to fresh meat and worse.

# **Tech-Priest**

Void born Tech-Priests are those given to care for the fabric and soul of their ship. Perhaps dedicated from birth, or recruited through natural aptitude, these Tech-Priests display an eerie connection with their vessel. Some specialise in knowing the ways and rites of particular systems, whilst others dedicate themselves to repair. Others still whisper into the captain's ear, their buzzing voices speaking of the desires of the ship itself.

Those who live their lives on spacecraft must become used to the reality-altering process of warp space, of living in low or even zero-gravity environments and of never knowing the feel of solid ground beneath their feet. Quite often a ship conducts its business in an endless cycle. Trade or mining vessels may never make berth, instead raising generations of families in the cold depths of space. Gravitational pressures, inbreeding and warp anomalies take their toll. What effect the warp has on these void born workers is uncertain, but there is something strange about them for all to see. Their features are drawn and their skin pallid. They may have some minor deformity, or oddness about their speech, gait or general appearance.

Some void born are raised on huge space stations—asteroid mining bases, battlefleet refit stations or research platforms. The rest come from a variety of backgrounds: the crew of merchant vessels or warships, miners, prison guards (or prisoners) or even the servants of a Rogue Trader. The largest ships are vast, city-sized constructions, many of which are thousands of years old. Lobotomised servitors and tech-adepts scuttle about their business, while menial crew, passengers and merchants co-exist in cramped corridors and tiny quarters. At the head of the ship's crew sits the Navigator, a strange breed of psyker who expertly guides the vessel through the immaterium, following the psychic beacon of the Astronomicon. Those void born raised in the service of the Imperial Navy or among the crew of a Rogue Trader know first-hand the horrors of space and the sheer multitude of the Emperor's enemies. This knowledge often forces ships' crew to form insular cliques, too afraid to look up from their duties or mini-societies for fear of what might stare back at them from the void.

Worst of all are the Black Ships of the Inquisition. These vessels are part of a large fleet travelling the Imperium in a huge circuit, visiting each Imperial world on their route once every hundred years or so. Their mission is to collect the psychic levy from each world—hundreds of psykers rounded up and handed over to the authorities for some unknown fate. Only when the vast holds of these ships are full of psykers do they return to Holy Terra. Some may display the strength and potential to serve the Imperium, however most are sacrificed to the God-Emperor, their gruesome deaths ensuring the survival of the Imperium. Life aboard these vessels is particularly harsh, for the psykers themselves are packed into huge holding cells, treated little better than cattle.

# **Void Born PCs**

You have called the interior of a hulking vessel or space station home all your life. Now you have been thrust into the company of others—people completely unlike you—and the culture shock is akin to plunging head first into freezing water. You feel awkward in the company of anyone who is not void born. Your lack of social skills, unusual appearance, nervous disposition and inability to carouse like your comrades combine to make you feel like a loner, a fish out of water. You only come into your own when your expertise is required—unlike the rest of them, you are at ease around psychic phenomena, warp anomalies and spacecraft, and as such your kind make the best Adepts and Imperial Psykers. As long as the common man stands in awe of you, he'll leave you alone, and that's just how you like it.

# **Void Born Skills**

All void born can speak a language unique to their home vessel. Void born gain the Speak Language (Ship Dialect) skill.

# **Void Born Traits**

The void born gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

# **Charmed**

The void born unconsciously channel the fickle powers of the warp, making them preternaturally lucky.

**Benefit:** Whenever you spend a Fate Point (though not if you burn one), roll a 1d10. On the roll of a natural 9, you do not lose the Fate Point.

# **Ill-Omened**

Whether because of their strange looks, clannish ways or unwholesome air, the void born are shunned and mistrusted by most. In addition the void born are most likely to attract any negative attention that the party of Acolytes creates accusations of curdling milk, disgruntled merchants, children with handfuls of Grox dung and so on.

**Penalty:** You take a –5 penalty on all Fellowship Tests made to interact with non-void born humans.

# **Shipwise**

Birthed in the depths of a spacefaring craft, the void born have a natural affinity for such vehicles.

**Benefit:** Navigation (Stellar) (Int) and Pilot (Spacecraft) (Ag) are Basic Skills for you.

# **Void Accustomed**

Due to their strange and unnatural childhood, the void born are used to the vagaries of changing gravity.

**Benefit:** You are immune to space travel sickness. In addition, zero- or low-gravity environments are not considered Difficult Terrain for you.

# **Example**

*Steve sits down to create his character. Since this is his first character for* Dark Heresy*, he's not quite sure what he wants to play, so he leaves his choice to fate. He rolls percentile dice (d100) and gets a 60. Comparing the result to Table 1-1: Random Home World, he finds his Acolyte hails from an Imperial world. He reads over the description and makes a few notes about his life before serving an Inquisitor. Then he records all of the information on his character sheet and then applying the effects of his Traits to his Skills (Forbidden Lore, Literacy and Speak Language (High Gothic)). Finally he makes a note to increase his Willpower Characteristic by +3. Now that he's done with this step, he's ready to generate his Characteristics.*

# Stage Two Generate Characteristics Stage Two: Generate Characteristics

*"Character is forged upon the anvil of war, hammered by circumstance and shaped by will."*

— War master Slaydo.

C Characteristics represent your character's raw ability in a variety of physical and mental areas. Characteristics are rated on a scale of 0 to 100. Your character's Characteristics are important for a variety of reasons, but principally, they reflect your ability to succeed at certain actions. Since you want to roll under your Characteristic when attempting to do something in the game that has dramatic consequences, the higher your Characteristic the better off you will be.

# **Weapon Skill (WS)**

Weapon Skill measures your character's competence in hand-to-hand fighting, whether using fists, knives or chainswords.

# **Ballistic Skill (BS)**

Ballistic Skill reflects your character's accuracy with ranged weapons, such as lasguns, crossbows and autopistols.

# **Strength (S)**

Strength describes how physically strong your character is.

# **Toughness (T)**

Toughness defines how easily you can shrug off injury as well as how easily you can resist toxins, poisonous environments, disease and other physical ailments.

# **Agility (Ag)**

Agility measures your character's quickness, reflexes and poise.

# **Intelligence (Int)**

Intelligence is a measurement of your character's acumen, reason and knowledge.

# **Perception (Per)**

Perception describes how well your character perceives his surroundings. It reflects the acuteness of senses.

# **Willpower (WP)**

Willpower demonstrates your character's ability to withstand the horrors of war, the terrors of space and the awfulness he is bound to encounter in his missions.

# **Fellowship (Fel)**

Fellowship is your character's ability to interact with other creatures, to deceive, charm or befriend.

# **Characteristic Bonuses**

Each Characteristic has a corresponding bonus. A Characteristic Bonus equals the tens digit of the score. For example, a character with 41 Strength has a 4 Strength Bonus. Generally, Characteristic Bonuses are used to determine success in situations or tests that have variable results. See **Chapter VII: Playing the Game** for more details.

# GENERATING CHARACTERISTICS**

Characteristics All Characteristics are generated by rolling 2d10 and adding the numbers on the dice together. This done, you add a modifier determined by your Home World. These modifiers can be found on the **Table 1-3: Generating Characteristics** table. Do this for each Characteristic until you have results for all nine. When recording your Characteristics on your character sheet remember to write the first digit of the number in the circle. This is so you can see what your Characteristic Bonuses are at a glance.

Since you are playing a character that is expected to be a cut above the rest of humanity, you may re-roll any one result. Should you choose to do this, you must keep the new result, even if it is worse than the old one.

# **Example**

*From our previous example, Steve's character is from an Imperial world, so when he rolls for his starting Characteristics, he uses the Imperial column. He rolls 2d10 and adds the Home World modifier nine times. Then he records the results on his character sheet. He rolls the dice, getting the following results:*

| Characteristic       | Dice    | Roll | Total        |
|----------------------|---------|------|--------------|
| Weapon Skill (WS)    | 2d10+20 | 10   | 30(Average)  |
| Ballistic Skill (BS) | 2d10+20 | 6    | 26 (Average) |
| Strength (S)         | 2d10+20 | 9    | 29 (Average) |
| Toughness (T)        | 2d10+20 | 7    | 27 (Average) |
| Agility (Ag)         | 2d10+20 | 12   | 32 (Average) |
| Intelligence (Int)   | 2d10+20 | 15   | 35 (Average) |
| Perception (Per)     | 2d10+20 | 12   | 32 (Average) |
| Willpower (WP)       | 2d10+20 | 13   | 33 (Average) |
| Fellowship (Fel)     | 2d10+20 | 7    | 27 (Average) |

*Steve gets one re-roll. Looking at his Characteristics, his worst score is Ballistic Skill. Since he hopes to be gunning down mutants and xenos, he decides to roll for Ballistic Skill again. He rolls 2d10 and gets a 15! He replaces his BS with 35, so his Characteristics now look like this.*

| WS | BS | S  | T  | Ag | Int | Per | WP | Fel |
|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|----|-----|
| 30 | 35 | 29 | 27 | 32 | 35  | 32  | 33 | 27  |

# Stage Three: Determine Career Path 

*"Be what the Emperor intended you to be, for then you shall succeed."*

— Chant of Abrogation, *The Books of Solace*.

A After generating your Home World and Characteristics, your next step is to determine your Career Path. A Career Path is a rough guideline to who you are, what you can do and your place in the Imperium. A Career Path helps guide your character's development, determining your starting gear, Skills, Talents and a variety of other factors, helping to build a place for yourself within your party of Acolytes.

To determine your Career Path you may either choose from those available for your Home World or, if you wish to trust your fate to the Emperor, you can generate it randomly. If you choose the latter, roll a d100 and compare the result under your Home World column on the **Table 1-4: Career Paths**. Once you know which Career Path your character is on, copy down all of the relevant information onto your character sheet starting Skills, Talents and Gear. In some cases you will need to make a choice between one thing or another. If in doubt over which to choose, ask your GM for advice. In addition, some Talents require prerequisites, such as having a certain score in a Characteristic; for the purposes of starting Talents characters may ignore these prerequisites.

Before play begins, you will get the chance to make further improvements to your character (for details, see **Stage Four: Spend Experience Points, Buy Equipment**).

**"As the mind to the body so the soul to the spirit, as death to the mortal man so failure to the immortal, such is the price of all ambition."**

# **ADEPT**

*"Knowledge is power. Do not waste it on the masses."* — Sector Governor Marius Hax.

Adepts are wise and learned scholars, at least they hope to be one day. They are skilled with languages, knowledge and often act as the brains of the group. They are not very good at fighting, and some are very poor at talking to people. When it comes to the realm of the mind however, they leave everyone else for dust.

**Starting Skills:** Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int), Literacy (Int), Trade (Copyist) (Int) or Trade (Valet) (Fel), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Scholastic Lore (Legend) (Int) or Common Lore (Tech) (Int).

Assassin

**Starting Talents:** Melee Weapon Training (Primitive) or Pistol Training (SP), Light Sleeper or Resistance (Cold), Sprint or Unremarkable.

**Starting Gear:** Stub revolver and 6 bullets or staff, Administratum robes (Common Quality Clothing), auto-quill or writing kit, chrono or hour glass, data-slate or illuminated tome, backpack.

**Starting Rank: Archivist***

# **ARBITRATOR**

*"No shield may stay the blade of justice."*

— Meditations of the Adeptus Arbites.

Arbitrators are tough law-keepers and judges. They ensure that the Imperium's laws are maintained, whilst also acting as executioners for rebels, seditionists and trouble-makers. Arbitrators do not serve on any local planetary police force, rather they are members of a higher organisation: the Adeptus Arbites. Arbitrators are not very strong, and they sometimes lack social graces. When it comes to sheer ability to soak up damage and to track down their prey, however, they are certainly the ones you want on your side.

**Starting Skills:** Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int), Literacy (Int), Common Lore (Adeptus Arbites) (Int), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Inquiry (Fel).

|                 |             | —Home World— |                |           |

# **ASSASSIN**

*"The Emperor wills all things, even death. Some deaths He wills swifter than others…"*

— Asthrid, Assassinorum Priestess.

Assassins are skilled killers, adept at getting close to a target and ending their days. Some are cold-blooded executioners that revel in bloodshed, while others are consummate professionals who take great pride in their art. Whatever their motivations, they represent some of the most dangerous men and women of the Inquisition, each one a finely honed tool of murder.

**Starting Skills:** Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int), Awareness (Per), Dodge (Ag).

**Starting Talents:** Melee Weapon Training (Primitive), Ambidextrous or Unremarkable, Thrown Weapon Training or Pistol Training (Las), Basic Weapon Training (SP), Pistol Training (SP).

**Starting Rank: Sell-Steel

# Cleric **CLERIC**

*"A man without faith is a man without a soul. Suffer not the soulless in thy ministry, for they make doors for dangerous forces."*

— *Commandments to the Ecclesiarchy*.

Clerics are the priests of the Emperor, members of the vast organisation known as the Ecclesiarchy. They are charismatic and capable leaders, as well as respected figures of authority. Clerics are trained in a wide variety of abilities, and can turn their hand to pretty much anything. Most notably they know how to lead and inspire, preaching from the front line as they charge into battle.

**Starting Skills**: Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int), Common Lore (Imperial Creed) (Int), Literacy (Int), Performer (Singer) (Fel) or Trade (Copyist) (Int), Trade (Cook) (Int) or Trade (Valet) (Fel).

**Starting Rank: Novice

# **GUARDSMAN**

*"Life is war. And I'm gonna win!"*

— "Trench Head" Jones.

Guardsmen are the fighters, killers and warriors of the 41st Millennium. Some may be members of a formal army, or even part of the Imperial Guard. Others may be nothing more than mercenaries and thugs. Some may even be convicted criminals, fitted with explosive collars and sentenced to serve in penal legions to pay for their terrible crimes. Needless to say, Guardsmen are neither particularly smart nor sociable. They more than make up for this with their ability to make things die in loud and unpleasant ways.

**Starting Skills:** Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int), Drive (Ground Vehicle) (Ag) or Swim (S).

**Starting Talents:** Melee Weapon Training (Primitive), Pistol Training (Primitive) or Pistol Training (Las) Basic Weapons Training (Las), Basic Weapon Training (Primitive) or Basic Weapons Training (SP).

**Starting Gear:** Sword or ax or hammer, flintlock pistol and 12 shots or laspistol and 1 charge pack, lasgun and 1 charge pack, bow and 10 arrows or musket and 12 shots or shotgun and 12 shells, knife, guard flak armor, uniform or stealth gear or street clothes (Common Quality Clothing), 1 week corpse starch rations, mercenary licence or explosive collar (still attached) or *Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer*.

**Starting Rank: Conscript

*"I have stood within the palace of the Throne on Holy Terra itself. There my soul was shattered and re-formed, a living weapon forged on the Emperor's will."*

— Primary Psyker Thassail Kain.

Psykers are otherworldly individuals with supernatural powers, they have many and varied abilities, from reading minds to throwing bolts of bio-electrical energy. These strange powers come with a terrible price however, for each psyker is a doorway to the hellish dimension of the immaterium, the abode of Daemons, psychic predators and worse.

| 43-49  | Dental Probes: You no longer have any teeth in your head. Perhaps they were shattered, or removed, or simplyfled your skull in protest at the psychic agony within. You have a set of carven dentures, formed from the teethof dead pilgrims. They are of Good quality and, whilst they have inestimable sentimental value to you, on theopen market they are worth approximately 50 Thrones. |
| 50-57  | Optical Rupture: Your sanctioning rituals have done great violence to your eyes. They have been removed andreplaced with Common quality cybernetic senses. See Chapter V: armory for more details on these.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 58-63  | Screaming Devotions: Your ruined vocal cords have been replaced with a vox inducer. This thumb-sized implant gleamsin the flesh of your neck. Other than granting you a rather mechanical timbre to your voice, this has no game effect.                                                                                                                                                              |

*"Yeah, crime pays. Why else do you think I do it?"* — "Verbal" Boze, Fenksworld Hive Ganger.

Scum are the criminals, outcasts, conmen, gangers, thieves and desperados of the Imperium. They are the flotsam and jetsam of society. For all their dubious origins, they do have numerous skills that are highly useful for secretive, quasi-legal tasks. From picking locks to street stabbings, forgery and fencing illegal goods, Scum have what it takes to get dodgy things done. Whilst neither strong nor particularly tough, Scum are good at social skills, as well as being rather agile. Perfect for getting in and out of trouble.

# **TECH-PRIEST**

*"I am a Child of the Omnissiah, cultist of the Machine God. The rites of manifold applications, the liturgies of ignition and the songs of Engine-seeing are mine own to know. I speak to the spirits of ancient tech-machines, from the warrior heart of a battle tank to the secret wisdom of the cogitator."*

— Vox Servitor Th3ta, on behalf of Cult Mechanicus Adept Manuel.

Tech-Priests are the guardians of machine-spirits and the preserver of the traditions of tech. They tend to incredibly arcane machines and learn many mysteries, such as the rites of ignition and the art of maintenance. As they learn of ancient science, they seek out lost technology, and also replace their frail flesh with gleaming steel or chattering circuitry.

**Starting Skills:** Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int), Tech-Use (Int), Literacy (Int), Secret Tongue (Tech) (Int), Trade (Scrimshawer) (Ag) or Trade (Copyist) (Int).

**Starting Talents:** Melee Weapon Training (Primitive), Basic Weapon Training (Las), Pistol Training (Las), Electro Graft Use. **Starting Traits:** Mechanicus Implants.

**Starting Gear:** Metal staff, las pistol and 1 charge pack, las carbine and 1 charge pack, knife, flak vest, glow lamp, data-slate, Mechanicus robes and vestments (Good Quality Clothing), 1d10 spare parts (power cells, wires, chronometers etc), vial of Sacred Machine Oil.

**Starting Rank: Technographer

# **Trait: Mechanicus Implants**

Over the course of many complicated rituals, you have been blessed and purified. You have been judged a suitable vessel for the following implants:

# **Electro-Graft**

This is a small port that is grafted into your nervous system. Once you have been properly trained, this will allow you to interface with machine data ports, and certain types of data nets. Electro-grafts can take many forms, such as electoos, skull shunts, finger probes or spine jacks.

# **Electoo Inductors**

These are palm-sized metal skin grafts that appear much like tattoos to the uninitiated. The electoos are wired into your nervous system, where they derive power from the bio-electrical emanations of the flesh. They can be used to emit or siphon power in many ways. Electoo inductors can be any colour, and can appear anywhere on the body—though hands or mechadendrites are the usual sites.

# **Respirator Unit**

This implant covers the lower half of your face with a network of grilles and tubing. It purifies your air supply, granting a +20% bonus to resist airborne toxins and gas weapons. The respirator unit also contains a vox-synthesiser capable of transmitting your voice in a variety of ways. Respirators can appear as simple grille units or intricate mask-like carvings.

# **Cyber-Mantle**

This is a framework of metal, wires and impulse transmitters that is bolted on to your spine and lower ribcage. As you gain further implants, this mantle will act as a sub-dermal anchorage point. Amongst some servants of the Omnissiah, this cyber-mantle is often referred to as 'the true flesh'. One would have to look beneath the red robes of a Tech-Priest to discover what a cybermantle looks like, and thus no one admits to having seen one.

# **Potentia Coil**

Cradled within the cyber-mantle is a power unit known as the potentia coil. This mass can store energy and produce various types of fields. Coils come in many types, from small crystal stack affairs, to bulky electrical galvinators salvaged from vehicle engines. Many a hunchback within the Adeptus Mechanicus is blamed upon a primitive coil.

# **Cranial Circuitry**

This is a series of linked processors, implants and cortical circuits that augments your mental capacities. Most sit within housing bolted onto the skull, whilst others nestle within the brain itself. As you grow in the seriousness of your devotions, more and more of the brain that deals with useless things such as emotion and intuition can be scooped away to provide room for additional augmentations. Cranial circuits are often very crude-looking, and frequently rather aged.

# **Example**

*Steve is now ready to determine his Career Path. He rolls a d100 and compares the result to the Table 1-4: Career Paths. He rolls a 44, indicating he is an Imperial world Cleric. He records his starting Skills, Talents and Gear, but he has some choices to make. He may select Performer (Singer) or Trade (Copyist), Trade (Cook or Valet), Basic Weapon Training (Primitive) or Thrown Weapon Training (Primitive). Steve opts for Trade (Copyist) and Trade (Valet) for his Skills and selects Basic Weapon Training (Primitive) for his Talents—the latter since he has a good Ballistic Skill. Steve has the following Skills and Talents:*

*Skills: Speak Language (Low Gothic), Common Lore (Imperial Creed), Literacy, Trade (Copyist, Valet).*

*Talents: Melee Weapon Training (Primitive), Basic Weapon Training (Primitive), Pistol Training (SP)*

*Steve also has a few choices about Gear. He chooses those that reflect his Talents and begins play with the following stuff:*

*Gear: Hammer, stub revolver and 6 bullets, crossbow and 10 bolts, flak vest, aquila necklace, Ecclesiarchy robes (Good Quality Clothing), 4 candles, charm (skull), backpack.*

# Stage Four: Spend Experience Points, Buy Equipment

*"If you knew back then, what you know now, you wouldn't ask 'Why, my lord?', but 'How?'"*
— from *The Rhyme of the Ancient Acolyte*.

Once you have determined your Career Path, your next step is to note down your character's Wounds, Fate Points, Movement and starting Wealth. Finally you spend your starting Experience Points by referencing the appropriate Rank Advances in **Chapter II: Career Paths** before moving onto Stage Five.

# **WOUNDS**

Wounds are a vital part of any character and represent how much punishment they can take before suffering serious injury. Roll on **Table 1-6: Starting Wounds** to determine your character's starting number of Wounds.

# Movement **MOVEMENT**

Characters may move at one of four speeds: Half Move, Full Move, Charge, or Run. The number of metres a character may move in his turn is determined by his Agility Bonus. Traits can modify some or all Movement speeds. Details on these modes of Movement can be found in **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**

Intelligence Advance Simple (+5) 100 Drive (Ground Vehicle) 100 Common Lore (Administratum) 100 Sound Constitution 100

# **Arbitrator**

Ballistic Skill Advance Simple (+5) 100 Awareness 100 Scrutiny 100 Sound Constitution 100

# **Assassin**

Weapon Skill Advance Simple (+5) 100 Inquiry 100 Heightened Senses (Sight) 100 Sound Constitution 100

# **It's a Hard Life**

A starting Experience of 400 represents the fact that your Acolyte is freshly recruited to the Inquisition, one amongst the hundreds conscripted by each Inquisitor. Surviving the 41st Millennium is going to be tough, but the challenge of surviving and rising above the common herd is a rewarding one. If your Game Master is running a campaign intended for more experienced characters, he may decide to gift your character with additional starting Experience and Money. If this is the case, simply spend the xp as if you had earned them through play. **Chapter II: Career Paths** describes this process in detail. For each 400 xp you are given, you receive a full month's wages (see **Chapter V: armory** for more details).

# **Cleric**

Fellowship Advance Simple (+5) 100 Awareness 100 Inquiry 100 Sound Constitution 100

# **Guardsman**

Weapon Skill Advance Simple (+5) 100 Ballistic Skill Advance Simple (+5) 100 Pistol Training (SP) 100 Sound Constitution 100

# **Example**

*Steve's character is now taking shape; the next step is to spend his starting Experience. He has 400 points and looking at the first Rank Advances for Clerics he decides to buy the simple advance for Fellowship, costing 100 points and increasing his character's Fellowship by 5. He then decides to buy a couple more Skills, purchasing both Awareness and Inquiry for 100 points each. Finally he chooses to make his Cleric a little more robust and spends his last 100 points on the Sound Constitution talent, increasing his character's Wounds by 1.*

# Stage Five: Bringing your Character to Life

*"There is surprisingly less to most men than meets the eye."* — Lady Olianthe Rathbone, Inquisitrix Prima.

T The numbers and words that you have written down so far are the nuts and bolts that define your character's capabilities. They say little about the character's appearance, age and other personal details that help you and others visualise your Acolyte. The following tables provide a randomised method for generating these details, but you need not roll on all of them; you may choose which features take your fancy if you prefer.

# **GENDER**

The wartorn 41st Millennium is not always an encouraging place to be for a female. Few get the opportunities of their male counterparts, but by the same token they also do not get exposed to the dangers out there in the wilder parts of the galaxy. Certain Imperial Guard regiments recruit females to fight alongside men; the Ecclesiarchy and the Inquisition likewise employ females at all ranks, but again their numbers are not in proportion to men. For Dark Heresy, players may pick whichever gender they wish to play, with no handicap. On some planets, however, as the GM determines, being a female will present its own extra challenges.

The Past

Note that in the text we refer to "he" throughout, but only as shorthand. This can equally be considered to say "she".

# **APPEARANCE**

Appearance encompasses all of your character's physical traits, such as build, age, coloration and physical quirks. Note down your quirks and history in the background section of your character sheet. While it is fun to randomly generate your appearance, you should feel free to alter any rolls on these tables if you want to, or even make up your own results to suit your needs.

# **THE PAST**

Your past has a strong influence on your character (unless of course, your maddened mind is choosing to block it all out). You may already have a great idea about where your character comes from, or what may have happened to them. If this is the case, go ahead and write it all down. If you would like a little inspiration, use the tables to figure out what happened before fate chose a greater role for your insignificant life.

# **Handedness**

Whether your character is left- or right-handed can have an effect on the game. You can either choose the handedness of your character or roll a die. On a 9 you are left-handed, otherwise you are right-handed. Obviously characters with the Ambidextrous talent do not need to know which hand they favor.

# **Feral World: Tribal Taboos**

Life on a feral world is often short and bloody. Monstrous beasts, harsh living conditions, disasters and war cut short many a life. Feral tribes know all too well that the universe is a cruel and savage place, hostile to man and full of malevolent forces that must be placated at all costs. There are many strange and varied beliefs upon these worlds, and growing up in such a place, your character has undoubtedly been affected by them. **Table 1-14: Feral World Superstitions** provides examples of the sorts of taboos your character might believe in, though obviously these are just a few of the many and varied superstitions that exist.

# Table 1–14: Feral World Superstitions  **Roll Belief**

- 01–10 **Dirt Ward:** Bathing allows enemy spirits to smell you out. You must keep a protective layer of grime to ward their bad luck away.
- 11–20 **Unlucky Colour:** Orange is the colour of disaster and death.
- 21–30 **Hunter's Oath:** Never eat something you could not kill yourself lest fate punish you for your arrogance.
- 31–40 **Thirsty Blade:** The spirit of your weapon is a hungry ghost. It must taste blood every time it is drawn lest great ill befall you and yours.
- 41–50 **Spirit Shackle:** If you take a trophy from a vanquished foe, you own their soul.
- 51–60 **Warrior Death:** A glorious death honours your people, whilst a coward's death shames them. Your ancestors are watching; do not disappoint.
- 61–70 **Power of Names:** Never use the true names of your friends and loved ones, lest daemons hear and use them for evil.
- 71–80 **Lonely Dead:** Never utter the names of the dead, lest you summon them back from the void.
- 81–90 **Living Record:** Scar your victories into your skin, so that upon your death your flayed hide may be presented to the Emperor that He may read of your deeds.
- 91–00 **Nemesis:** The Emperor has decreed the time and manner of your death. Somewhere out there is the beast that will kill you. Your fate is to seek out this creature and face it head on. Until that time, you believe that nothing will harm you.

# **Hive World: Hive Class**

Life within the packed spires of a hive is frenetic at best. A strong sense of place runs through many hives and it is frequently this alone that stops the untold masses from rising up and attacking their betters. Your character's position within the hive determines whether he was forced to struggle up from the hyper-violent filth of the underhive or had it easy as a high-living spire noble. **Table 1-15: Hive Class** will determine your position within hive society.

# Table 1–15: Hive Class

#### **Roll Result**

- 01–20 **Dross Hound:** You grew up in the dankest, darkest depths of the hive, scrabbling for food, light and warmth. You have had to be vicious to survive, and likely prize your possessions and comfort above all.
- 21–40 **Ganger Scum:** You ran with a pack of violent gangers to survive the squalid underhive. You have seen turf war, betrayal and outstanding loyalty—often in the same gunfight. You likely prize your pride, territory and gang mates above all.
- 41–60 **Factory Dregs:** Your parents toiled in the manufactorum, working themselves into the grave for the good of the hive. You were poor, but at least you were honest, unlike the ganger scum. You likely prize duty, honour and obligation above all things.
- 61–80 **Middle Hive:** You grew up in the middle hive, where things were cramped, but at least you did not have to work in the more dangerous manufactorum. You have always been part of a vast crowd—whether sleeping, eating or relaxing of an eve-cycle. You likely prize individuality, privacy and your personal rights above all things.
- 81–90 **Specialist:** Your family were of a special caste. Perhaps they knew the arcane workings of the air conditioning units or they cleansed the outside of the hive. You have grown up part of the hive, but apart from it all. You likely prize your area of expertise, opinions and individual merits above all things.
- 91–00 **Hive Noble:** Your family were of the privileged few at the top of the spire, living in luxury unimaginable to other hivers. You had everything you could ever want: space, privacy, sunlight—yet also the burden of leadership. You likely prize dignity, respect from your lessers and strength above all things.

# **Imperial World: Birth Planet**

The Imperium sprawls across the galaxy, filled with a near-endless variety of planets. Mankind survives on all manner of worlds, living in all manner of societies. The type of planet your character grew up on will determine much about them. **Table 1-16: Planet of Birth** gives an idea of the sorts of worlds you may call home, and what that means for your character.

# Table 1–16: Planet of Birth

- **Roll Result**
- 01–20 **Agri-world:** You were born on a world devoted to producing food. Perhaps your home world supported a nearby hive world, or the Imperial tithe inexplicably demands it. Your people likely seek excitement and the exotic to vary the dull routine of the farm.
- 21–40 **Backwater:** Your home world is largely forgotten by the Imperium. Lost from the Administratum scrolls and isolated from the universe, your people are likely to be self-sufficient and sceptical.
- 41–60 **Feudal World:** Your home world is a primitive planet, with but the simplest of technologies, such as swords, chariots and black powder. Your people are likely to be loyal, practical and highly superstitious.
- 61–70 **War Zone:** Whatever your home world once was, it is now a seething mass of bloodied ruins, struggling soldiers and whistling ordnance. Perhaps civil war rages, or maybe Orks seek to destroy all. Whatever the case, your people are likely to be grim, tenacious and dedicated.
- 71–80 **Dead Planet:** Your home world is little more than a habitat perched upon some blasted rock. Maybe a mining colony upon an airless moon, or perhaps an expedition to uncover some longdead alien race, your people are likely to be thoughtful, melancholy types, with a curiousity for greenery and the outdoors.
- 81–90 **Shrine World:** Your home world is controlled by the priests of the Emperor. Perhaps it is covered in gleaming spires and vast temples, or perhaps it welcomes countless pilgrims to its holy battle sites. Whatever the case, your people are likely to be devoted servants of the Emperor, pious, dependable and honest.
- 91–00 **Paradise Planet:** Your home world is one of the rare and coveted paradise planets, where it is forever summertime, and the living is easy. Aside from being objects of envy and scorn for the rest of the Imperium, your people are likely to be somewhat bemused by the cruel nature of the universe, with a naive optimism that others find highly foolish.

# **Void Born: Ship Tradition**

Reared aboard spacecraft travelling between the distant stars, the void born, like all ship crew, are intensely loyal to the vessel of their birth. Rather like those living within the protective walls of a city-state, the void born look to their craft for protection, employment and identity. Many go from cradle to coffin without ever leaving their ship, and often that suits them very well. The type of craft dictates much about the lives of the people aboard it, from their daily routine to their personalities and desires. Roll on **Table 1-17: Void Born Craft of Origin** to find ideas of how the ship of your birth might affect your character.

# Table 1–17: Void Born Craft of Origin **Roll Result**

- 01–20 **Space Hulk:** You were born upon a ragged mass of flotsam and jetsam—space worthy, but only just. Probably the survivors of some terrible accident stuck aboard an abandoned wreck, you grew up in a world of leaking door seals, dark corridors, haunted decks and the knowledge that "things" were aboard ship just out of sight. You are likely to be cautious, superstitious and trigger-happy.
- 21–40 **Orbital:** You were born upon a vast and ancient satellite, orbiting some star, moon or planet. Likely part of a scientific mission, isolationist retreat or military stationing, you grew up in a world of routine and repetition, with endless orbital cycles, rituals of observance and maintenance rotes. You are likely to be very methodical, with a secret desire for rebellion and indulgence.
- 41–60 **Chartist Vessel:** You were born upon one of the great trading vessels of old. As part of a crew endlessly plying a traditional route, you grew up within the gloomy holds, packed with exotic riches you could never own. Fearfully accepted into port, yet welcomed at none, you are likely to be materialist in nature, with a great eye for deals and a cynical view of human nature.
- 61–80 **War Ship:** You were born amidst the crash and thunder of battle, and grew up amidst the gun crews and the troopers, crammed into ranksmelling bunks or the stultifying formality of the officers' quarters. You are likely to be a great respecter of authority, with a liking for procedure and a no-nonsense attitude towards slackers.
- 81–00 **Rogue Trader:** You were born on an eccentric craft that knew no authority other than the charismatic Rogue Trader at the helm. You grew up in a chaotic whirl of exploration, battle, flight and negotiation with all manner of aliens, nations and forces. You are likely to be rebellious by nature, with a dislike of routine and discipline.

# **Divination**

Many folk look to the Imperial Tarot as an instrument of the Emperor's divine guidance. On entrance to the service of the Inquisition, many Acolytes take part in strange and terrible divination rites, in order to learn more of their part in the Throne's great plan. In smoke-filled rooms, blind robe-clad seers peer into their holorogic decks, proclaiming sage advice for those who would serve at the left hand of the Emperor. Sometimes these divinations point to the death and undoing of a soul, other times they are stout words to live by. In some cases, they have a bitter irony only discovered in hindsight. To discover what words of wisdom were bestowed upon your character, roll on **Table 1-18: Imperial Divination**. All divinations provide a mechanical effect that further alters your character.

# **NATURE**

The character creation process provides you with the skeleton of your alter ego, however these numbers and notes are not the sum total of your character—there is of course a vital fifth element: you! The background details of your character's life are largely up to you as is of course their personality.

Some people like to develop their characters during play and that is a perfectly reasonable approach. When you start to play, it may be enough to know that your character is hive world Scum who has left Scintilla to serve the Inquisition. Many players, however, prefer to work out background and personality before play begins. If you need some help fleshing out your character, try answering these six questions. They should allow you to focus your thoughts on your emerging alter ego.

# **What is Your Personality Like?**

Perhaps the first thing to consider is your disposition. What are you like? Fiery and passionate or earthy and practical? Are you pessimistic or do you always believe the best will happen? Are you a people person or a misanthrope? How do you take to extremes of pressure? What makes you different to the other Acolytes in your group? Here are some traits that might get you started:

**Bilious:** Suspicious, angry yet very watchful and aware. 

**Cardinal:** Seeks balance in all things, yet often cannot choose a path forward.

**Choleric:** Active, takes charge, yet easy to anger.

**Fixed:** Solid, unyielding and definitive in all things.

**Melancholic:** Thoughtful, introspective and prone to depression.

**Mutable:** Unpredictable, undisciplined and rebellious. 

**Phlegmatic:** Practical, careful, yet very reserved. 

**Sanguine:** Confident, optimistic, yet prone to dreams and whimsy.

**Supine:** Loyal, devout yet easily led.

# **How Did You Meet Your Inquisitor?**

Your introduction to the Inquisition would have been a crucial moment in your history. Did you meet by chance, or did your Inquisitor seek you out for recruitment? Perhaps you saved your Inquisitor's life upon the battlefield, or maybe a chance ink blot on an Administratum scroll saw you chosen above another. Maybe you accused a stranger of heresy, only to discover the stranger was an Inquisitor. Perhaps you were sold upon the slave block in an exotic bazaar, or perhaps your shiv-crew gave you away as a blood debt. Perhaps you were hired to catalogue the ancient library of a noble, only to discover a secret cache of heretical tomes, and that your true patron was involved in dark conspiracies. Perhaps a great chariot arrived from the sky, in a mist of flame and smoke, and you were offered to its master as a way of appeasing the great Eagle of the Sun. Whatever the case, the circumstances of your

initiation into the Inquisition will likely colour your opinions and beliefs for some time to come…

# **What Does the Inquisition Mean to You?**

The Inquisition is a bastion of defence in a universe hostile to mankind. Threats are all around, and certain doom looms closer than folk know. The forces of Chaos, heresy, xenos and sedition would drag the Imperium into the blackness of oblivion, were it not for people like you… or so they say. Do you believe what you are told about the horrors of the universe and your role as a foot soldier in the great and secret game? Is your role as an Acolyte a holy one, ordained by the Emperor, or is it a chance to gain power, possessions or maybe even revenge? Will you work to defend the Imperium, or merely your own skin?

# **What Will You Sacrifice?**

The Emperor will not judge you by your medals, but by your scars. How many are you willing to receive in the name of the Inquisition? How far will you go to do your duty? Death is certain, but does its manner matter? What methods are you willing to use in order to fulfil your obligations to your Inquisitor? Perhaps you are willing to sacrifice the flesh, but the thought of insanity turns your stomach. Perhaps you arrange things so that other Acolytes take the fall, and you are left with naught but a guilty conscience. Perhaps your zeal is so deep that you are willing to deal with dark forces to get results, no matter that it costs your very soul.

# **What Do You Desire?**

You stand at the left hand of the Emperor, ready to give your life to defend all that humanity holds dear. What are the things that warm your heart through the long dark night of the soul? Perhaps a person or place, or a world destroyed? Perhaps you love the God-Emperor with great fervour, or perhaps you are very attached to your own hide. Maybe you love the muzzle flare of your boltgun and the satisfying smack of chainblade on xenos bone. Perhaps you love justice, truth or violence a great deal. Maybe you'll settle for a lho-stick and a measure of rotgut in a dirty glass…

# **What Do You Hate?**

Hatred's flame burns long and cold, even when all hope is extinguished. What will sustain you through violence, horror and death? Do you seek to purge all mutants? Do you wish to lay low the vile aliens that slaughtered your colonist friends? Perhaps a loved one fell foul of the blandishments of the Dark Powers. Maybe you escaped the clutches of a cult, or perhaps you have seen the despair of war. Perhaps you hate the enemies of mankind with a passion. Maybe you simply cannot stand to be wrong, or to miss a shot. Maybe there is a secret weakness in your soul, a fault line of corruption that only you can see…

# **NAME**

*"What's in a name? An Ork by any other term would still see us as meat."*

— Catuldynus, *The Once-Pure Hive.*

Choosing a name for your character can be very difficult. If you are lucky enough to have a name in mind, go ahead and write it down. If, like most of us, you have difficulty coming up with a name on the spot, this section will help guide you in creating a great name for your Player Character.

Names within the 41st Millennium are as varied as the many thousands of worlds that make up the Imperium. As mankind is an inventive and contrary creature, there are no standard or universal conventions that govern the names people give themselves. In some places, a single simple name might indicate low birth and ignominy, whilst in others it might act as a mark of extreme power, fame and good breeding. When deciding upon a name, feel free to mix and match any of the suggestions made by the naming tables. The idea, of course, is to create a name that suits your character, and no one knows more about your character than you do.

**TYPES OF NAME**

There are five types of name presented here:

**High Gothic** names are drawn from the ancient High Gothic tongue. They have an air of authority, seriousness and power to them.

**Primitive** names are short and brutal—often like the lives of their owners.

**Low Gothic** names trace their lineage to a High Gothic past, but have become much debased with centuries of use and abuse.

**Archaic** names herald from the distant past. They might be the names of mighty saints, heroes or other figures from Ministorum legends. Others are so incredibly old as to have lost all trace of their origins.

**Informal** names are just that—nicknames, terms and slang names that a person might earn through deeds (or misdeeds).

You may decide that a particular type of name is especially appropriate for your character. If this is the case, you should roll or pick from the appropriate list for your character's gender. If nothing immediately springs to mind, roll the dice, consult name tables and choose the name you prefer.

# **Multiple Names**

Man is a superstitious creature, and rightly so, for the universe is filled with beings that seem bent on his destruction. A surprising number of cultures believe that a person needs a selection of different names for different purposes. Many have a common or "use" name which is for everyday purposes. These are often debased terms, worn down with use into short, strong-sounding names. In contrast, a personal name with soft and pleasant connotations might be used with family and friends. Some cultures have a secret or "true" name which is believed to hold considerable power over a person. These names are said to be consumed should a person foolishly make some form of pact with a daemonic entity. If you would like multiple names for your character, feel free to roll several times on the name tables.

# Stage Six: Play the Game!

With your Dark Heresy character created, you are ready to play the game. Before you start throwing dice around and getting into all sorts of trouble, you should probably take a good look at **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**, which describes what all of these numbers mean, how to fight and move about the worlds of the 41st Millennium. Once you have a handle on game play, it won't hurt to give a look at **Chapter IX: Life in the Imperium**, which explains the core setting concepts that define the world of *Warhammer 40,000*. Other than these two chapters, you are ready to embark on your new adventure into the darker corners of the Dark Heresy universe! W

# EXAMPLE CHARACTER SHEET

As a player, the Character Sheet is your most important possession as it clearly details everything about your Player Character. One side of the sheet details all of your character's Skills and Talents—called the investigation side of the sheet. The reverse of the sheet details your equipment, weapons and armor—called the combat side. You'll refer to both sides throughout a game of Dark Heresy. Here are some tips for its upkeep:

**Make a back-up:** Every few gaming sessions, make a photocopy of your character sheet, or copy it onto a new sheet. If you don't, a split drink or pizza accident is all that it will take to spell disaster!

**Share with your Game Master:** Let your GM see your sheet

**Character Folio:** You'll probably find that you go through a number of sheets as your character progresses. This is where the Character Folio comes in—a deluxe version of a Character Sheet, with more space and sections for fully detailing your character and their exploits in the service of the Inquisition. Printed in a small booklet form and on quality paper, the Character Folio is a more permanent option. Character Folios should be available wherever you bought this book.
