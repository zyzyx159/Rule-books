*"Use the talent that your toil has made, for what use a solar-cell in the shade?"*

— Catuldynus, *The Once Pure Hive.*

A An Acolyte's duties will see him performing all sorts of deeds in the name of the Inquisition. From fighting debased mutants to investigating ancient xenos ruins, Acolytes will need a wide array of abilities to survive in the 41st Millennium.

Just like Skills, Talents represent some of the things your character can do. These are often things your character has learnt through training, such as running faster or being able to shrug off near-fatal wounds. Sometimes they are special or unique powers, such as Psychic Talents, or miraculous Tech-Priest abilities. Unlike Skills, you usually don't need to test against Talents to activate them. Most are always active. In fact, there are many Talents that will give you bonuses to your Skill Tests, or even allow you to use Skills in different ways.

Deciding which Talents you would like to give your character is an enjoyable process, but it can be very hard to choose. Fortunately, the advancement schemes in **Chapter II: Career Paths** provide plenty of help.

# Gaining Talents

During character creation you will automatically receive some Talents, and be asked to choose between others (see **Chapter I: Character Creation** for more information). Once you've started playing, you can use Experience Points to purchase new Talents from the various Advancement Schemes in your Career Path (see **Chapter II: Career Paths** for more information).

# Talent Groups

Some of the listed Talents are actually groups of related abilities. Talent groups are listed under one entry for the sake of ease, but each one is a separate ability that must be acquired individually. For example, Basic Weapon Training (Las) and Basic Weapon Training (Bolt) are different Talents. If a character wanted to effectively use both a lasgun and a boltgun they would require both Talents.

# Prerequisites

Some Talents may require the character to meet some form of prerequisite before they can be acquired. This is usually a certain level in a Characteristic or another Skill or Talent, though sometimes a Talent may require something more dramatic such as the character being able to use Psychic Powers.

# **Air of Authority**

### **Prerequisites:** Fellowship 30.

You exude a natural aura of command, instilling subservience in all around you. On a successful Command Test, you may affect a number of targets equal to 1d10 plus your Fellowship Bonus.

You may attempt to get non-servants to follow your commands by making a Command Test with a –10 penalty.

# **Ambidextrous**

### **Prerequisites:** Agility 30.

Whenever you engage an opponent and make a melee attack, you may make an Acrobatics Test to move at your Half Move rate as a Free Action. Your opponent may not take the customary free attack.

# **Autosanguine**

Ancient and blessed technology filters your blood. Handed down from generations past, your implants repair minor injuries. For the purposes of healing, you are always considered to be Lightly Wounded. In addition, you naturally heal at an increased rate, removing 2 points of Damage each day. Your autosanguinators also sooth the minor pains and sores caused by the blessed metal of your implants pressing upon your weak flesh. This has no game effect, but does make you slightly less irritable than before.

# **Basic Weapon Training**

You are nimble and balanced, like a cat, and are able to fall much greater distances unharmed than others might. Whenever you fall, you may Test Agility as a Free Action. On a success, and for every degree of success, reduce the distance fallen by a number of metres equal to your Agility Bonus for the purposes of determining the Damage dealt by the fall.

# **Chem Geld**

A variety of chemical and surgical treatments have rendered you immune to the temptations of the flesh.

When you take this Talent you gain one Insanity Point.

If the searcher employs additional technology, such as a medicae scanner or chem-sniffer, this difficulty is reduced to Ordinary (+10).

# **Corpus Conversion**

# **Decadence**

You devote a great deal of time and effort into mastering your Discipline. Choose one of your Disciplines. You gain a +2 to Power Rolls made to manifest any powers of this Discipline.

You take a –10 penalty to Fellowship Tests when dealing with persons who are likely to be off put by your manner (psykers, small children, nervous Grox and so on).

# **Fearless**

Whether through fervent loyalty or a derangement of the mind, you are impossible to frighten or unnerve. You are immune to the effects of Fear and Pinning, but to disengage from combat or back down from a fight you must first succeed on a Willpower Test.

# **Feedback Screech**

**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Respirator Unit).

By muttering illogical formulae under your breath, you are able to foment rebellion within your vox synthesisers. Your audio circuits protest in a screeching blast of noise, shocking and distracting others in equal measure. All creatures, except Daemonic and machine-based, within a 30 metre radius must make a Willpower Test or lose a Half Action on their next Turn as they shudder, swear, cover their ears or otherwise react to the horrid noise. This is a Full Action and may not be used again for 1d5 Rounds while your audio circuits reset.

You can incite yourself into a frothing rage. You must spend one Round psyching yourself up (howling, beating yourself or injecting psychosisinducing drugs). The next round you lose control and go berserk, gaining a +10 bonus to Strength and Willpower but a –10 penalty to Weapon Skill and Intelligence. You must attack the nearest enemy in melee combat and you may not flee, retreat or Parry. When possible, you must use the All-Out Attack Manoeuvre. You remain frenzied for the duration of the combat. Some creatures, particularly certain types of Daemon, do not need to spend a Round inciting the frenzy—they are either permanently Frenzied or can Frenzy at will. Unless you have a Talent that allows you to do so, you may not use Psychic Powers whilst in Frenzy.

# **Furious Assault**

**Prerequisites:** Willpower 30, Command. Not through mercy and kindness but through a stern demeanour and a sense of justice do you inspire loyalty in your followers. So long as you are visible to them, your minions may reroll failed Willpower Tests made to resist Fear and Pinning.

You are made of sturdy stuff and can weather minor blows. When you become Stunned you may make a Toughness Test to shrug off its effects.

# **Prerequisites:** Agility 30.

You are hard to keep down. You may stand up as a Free Action.

# **Light Sleeper**

# **Prerequisites:** Perception 30.

You are a light sleeper and remain alert when most would be fast asleep.

The downside is that you often feel tired during the day and as a result are grumpy or distracted.

# **Prerequisites:** Swift Attack.

As a Full Action, you may make three melee attacks on your Turn. This Talent replaces Swift Attack. You may not use the Dual Strike talent during a Lightning Attack Full Action.

You are so impassioned in your hatred that you can rouse others to similar heights of emotion. As a Full Action, you may make a Charm Test to extend the effects of your Hatred talent to those around you. A successful Test grants a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests to one target per point of your Fellowship Bonus when fighting your hated foes. The effects last for the duration of the encounter.

# **Logis Implant**

You may utilise analytical circuits to calculate trajectory and reactions to a preternatural extent. Your ability to read possible outcomes lets you anticipate the movement of your opponents. As a Reaction you may make a Tech-Use Test to activate your Logis Implant. Note that this uses up your Reaction for the Round.

Each time you use this Talent, you gain a level of Fatigue.

# **Luminen Charge**

**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo inductor/Potentia coil).

You have learnt how to lend your life force to technology. On a successful Toughness Test you may use your bio-electrical field to recharge or power machinery.

| Difficulty       | Example                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ordinary (+10)   | Chemical battery, glow globe.                          |

| Difficult (–10)  | Overcharge pack, air conditioning unit, servo skull.   |
| Hard (–20)       | Land speeder engine, las cannon charge pack, servitor. |
| Very Hard (–30)  | Industrial press, cogita tor engine, xenos tech.       |


Note that at the GM's discretion, some technology is simply too arcane, broken or power-hungry for you to be able to activate. Each time you use this Talent, you gain a level of Fatigue.

# **Luminen Shock**

**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo inductor/Potentia coil).

By focusing your bio-electrical energy through electoo inductors, you are able to damage your opponents. You must touch your enemy for this ability to work.

Each time you use this Talent, you gain a level of Fatigue.

By long hours of rote learning, you have mastered one of the miracles of the Omnissiah.

You may move at your normal walking pace and must employ a Half Action each round to concentrate on maintaining the rite. You may activate this rite whilst falling to slow your rate of descent. Treat all falling Damage as 1d10+3 Impact Damage. Each Maglev Grace exhausts the power stored in your potentia coil, and thus you may only use this rite once in every twelve hour period.

# **Maglev Transcendence**

**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Potentia coil), Maglev Grace.

Devotion to the Machine God has granted you greater knowledge of miracles. As a Half Action, you may hover 20–30 centimetres off the ground for a number of minutes equal to 2d10 plus your Toughness Bonus. You may move at your normal running speed and must employ a Half Action each Round to concentrate on maintaining your rite. You may activate this rite whilst falling to produce a controlled descent.

You are trained in the most advanced medical techniques known to man. You gain a +10 bonus on all Medicae Tests.

On a failure, the psyker takes 1d10 points of Damage plus 1 Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus. This Damage is considered Impact Damage, directed at the head (more specifically, the face). The psyker can reduce this Damage by an amount equal to his Willpower Bonus. This Damage bypasses armor and any Toughness Bonus.

You channel your madness and hate into your Psychic Powers. You may use your Psychic Powers whilst in a Frenzied state,.

You know how to blast away with a gun to cause the most damage to a target. You add +2 to Damage you inict with a ranged weapon.

# **Mimic**

You have an extraordinary ability to copy another person's voice patterns. This may be due to implanted vox synthesisers, training or natural Talent. You must have listened to your target for at least one hour in order to study their voice properly. You must also understand their language and be of the same race (a human, for example, cannot convincingly copy an Ork). Listeners must succeed on a Difficult (–10) Scrutiny Test to realise that you are not the person you are mimicking. If you have based your voice patterns on anything other than "live" conversations where you are in the same room as your target (for example vox recordings, or commlink conversations), the Difficulty of this Scrutiny Test is reduced to Challenging (+0). Note this does not make you look like your target; you merely sound like them. If a listener can clearly see you are not the person you are copying, your deception automatically fails.

# **Rite of Awe**

**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Respirator Unit).

You may recite an infrasonic liturgy that causes awe and fear. All humans within a 50 metre radius regardless of their ability to hear, feel a sense of dread and religious guilt. Alongside these emotional effects, all humans take a –10 penalty to their next Skill Test. Characters may make a Willpower Test to shake off these effects. Whilst incanting the rite, you may not talk on any additional frequency. The rite is two minutes long, and it is considered very bad form to break off incantations at any point within the liturgy. Note that humans without auditory implants cannot hear infrasonic sound, and thus will assume you are not speaking.

# **Rite of Fear**

**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Respirator Unit).

You may recite an infrasonic dirge, which causes terror within the weak. All humans, regardless of their ability to hear, within a 50 metre radius consider you to have a Fear Rating of 1. Whilst incanting the dirge, you may not talk on any additional frequency. The rite is two minutes long, and it is considered very bad form to break off incantations at any point within the liturgy.

You have replaced the creative right half of your brain with a cogitator. You no longer feel emotion, and are instead filled with the cold purity of logic.

You strike with precision, landing your blows wherever you intend them to hit. When determining where you hit an opponent with a melee attack, you may use the dice as you rolled them or reverse them, choosing the location you prefer. *For example, Beam rolls a 37 to hit an Ork. Ordinarily, Beam would strike location 73—the right leg but because he has the Sure Strike talent, he could choose to hit the alien in location 37—the body.*

# **Swift Attack**

**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 35.

As a Full Action, you may make two melee attacks on your Turn.

# **Takedown**

You are skilled at taking an opponent alive. As a Half Action you may declare that you are attempting to Takedown an opponent before Testing Weapon Skill. If you hit and do at least 1 point of Damage, this damage is ignored and your opponent must make a Toughness Test or be Stunned for one Round.

# **True Grit**

### **Prerequisites:** Toughness 40.

You are able to shrug off wounds that would fell lesser men. Whenever you suffer Critical Damage, halve the result (rounding up).

# **Example**

*Drake has the True Grit talent and is shot for 12 points of Damage. He has a TB of 3, 2 points of armor and 3 Wounds remaining. This means that after reduction for TB, armor and Wounds, the Critical Damage he takes (i.e. damage suffered once a character reaches 0 Wounds) is 4 (12-3+2+3=4). Because he has the True Grit talent this Damage is then halved. Drake therefore only takes 2 points of Critical Damage.*

# **Two-Weapon Wielder**

**Talent Groups:** Ballistic, Melee. **Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 35 or Weapon Skill 35, Agility 35.

When armed with two weapons of a particular type, you may spend a Full Action to attack with both on your turn.

# **Wall of Steel**

## **Prerequisites:** Agility 35.

Your blades are so quick that they form a wall of impenetrable steel. You may make an additional Parry once per Round. In effect, this gives a character a second Reaction that may only be used to Parry, thus allowing them to make two Parries in a Turn. Note they may still only attempt a single Parry against any one attack.
