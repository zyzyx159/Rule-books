# Chapter II: Career Paths

*"There is no greater glory than a lifetime of dutiful service."* — Imperial adage.

As an Acolyte of the Inquisition, you are apart from everyone else in the Imperium of Man. Humanity toils and prays, forever ignorant of the great forces threatening to destroy the galaxy. Whilst they go about their lives, Acolytes like you wage a secret war against malefic beings whose names must never be spoken. Whilst the masses sleep at night, you are investigating secretive cults who meet in darkness to spill blood and pray to their obscene gods. As they slave in the manufactorum, you are bringing righteous fire to twisted mutants in the depths of a hive. As they peer fearfully at the blackness of space, you are plunging into the very darkness between the stars, uncovering ancient horrors upon planets long dead. You of all the teeming billions have been chosen to serve at the Emperor's left hand. Yours is a weighty duty, yet a vital one.

Not all Acolytes serve the Inquisition in the same way. Sometimes an Inquisitor has need of capable Guardsmen who can purge a nest of xenos cultists or an Arbitrator who can wring the truth from a petty thief. Sometimes an Inquisitor will need the services of an Adept to translate an ancient tome of knowledge or perhaps he must resort to dealing with Scum to get what he needs.

Your Career Path represents your character's abilities and potential—effectively, your role within an Inquisitor's retinue. It defines what you were before you joined the Inquisition, and how you will continue to develop. Your career will define how you are viewed, what new abilities you can learn, as well as the sorts of things you will be getting up to. Part of the fun of Dark Heresy is deciding exactly how your character will develop within your Career Path, for there are many choices available and no one "right" way of progressing.

# Getting GETTING STARTED

*"Serve the Emperor today, for tomorrow you may be dead!"* — *Lexiconum Moralis*.

Your character's Career Path is decided during the character creation process. Your choice of Home World will determine what paths are available to your character. You may decide to pick your Career Path for yourself, or to use the random tables in **Chapter I: Character Creation** to choose for you.

Each Career Path has its own dedicated section within this chapter. Once you know what path your character is following, take the time to have a good read through the appropriate section. This will tell you all the important things you need to know about playing your character, and how you can expect them to develop over time.

# **CAREER PATH FORMAT**

Each Career Path uses the following format:

# **Description**

In each Career Path section you can find a description and illustration to help give you some ideas about what your character might be like. This section tells you a little bit about the background for the career and how it fits into the Imperium as a whole.

# **Rank Chart**

Each Career Path is divided into a series of Ranks. This chart tells you the name of each Rank, as well as the level of progression necessary to reach a certain Rank.

# **Characteristic Advance Scheme**

Each Career Path allows you to improve your character's raw abilities, or Characteristics. Depending on the nature of the Career Path, some Characteristics are more difficult to increase than others. This chart lists the cost of each Characteristic Advance you can take.

# **Rank Advance Scheme**

For each Rank within your Career Path you will find a table that shows you what new abilities your character can learn, and what you must do in order to learn them. You'll also find a short quote and description for each Rank.

# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENTS

*"Thought for the day: hard work conquers everything."* — *The Gunmetallicus Primer*.

A As you adventure through the 41st Millennium, your character will have plenty of opportunity to improve. Your Game Master will reward you with Experience Points that you can spend to further develop your character. Each career has plenty of room for you to customize your character and make them unique.

There are three types of improvement that can happen to your character:

- Characteristic Advance—Increases your raw abilities
- Rank increase—Opens new training opportunities
- Skill or Talent Advance—Learn new Skills or Talents

In addition to the Advances listed for the Ranks within your Career Path, sometimes your GM will allow you to purchase an Elite Advance.

# **CHARACTERISTIC ADVANCE**

A Characteristic Advance is an increase to your character's raw abilities. When you buy a Characteristic Advance, you add +5 to the Characteristic on your character sheet.

Characteristic Advancements are divided into four progression levels. These are as follows:

**Simple:** A small fulfilment of your potential.

**Intermediate:** A significant improvement to your capabilities. **Trained:** Active, focused effort upon improving one's prowess. **Expert:** The limit of your natural capabilities.

As you set about increasing a Characteristic, you must progress through each of the progression levels in turn, starting at Simple and ending with Expert.

The costs for each career are listed in the relevant career section in a table, which looks like this:

# **Arbitrator Characteristic Advance Scheme**

**Characteristic Simple Intermediate Trained Expert** WS 250 xp 500 xp 750 xp 1,000 xp

As you can see, the first +5 increase to an Arbitrator's Weapon Skill costs 250 xp; the next +5 (the Intermediate progression level) would cost 500 xp; a further +5 improvement (the Trained progression level) would cost 750 xp; while the final possible improvement (Expert progression level) costs 1,000 xp.

The costs for Characteristic Advances are cumulative. So you couldn't just pay 500 xp for a +10 increase. Instead, you'd pay 250 xp for the Simple Advance, and then pay 500 xp for the Intermediate Advance.

# **Example**

*Steve decides he wants to improve his Arbitrator's Weapon Skill. His starting profile is 25. Steve wishes to increase it to 35. Looking at the Characteristic Advance Scheme for the Arbitrator career, Steve notes the cost of a Simple progression is 250 xp. He purchases this advance, and increases his Weapon Skill to 30 (25+5=30). Next, Steve notes the cost of an Intermediate progression, which costs 500 xp. He purchases this advance, increasing his Weapon Skill from 30 to 35 (30+5=35). In total Steve has paid 750 xp to increase his Weapon Skill by 10 (250+500=750).*

# **RANKS**

Your Rank is a general measure of your experience and capabilities. It represents the progression of your character's abilities as they try to prove themselves worthy of Inquisitorial status. Your Rank is determined by the total amount of Experience Points your character has spent. The Advancement Scheme for each Rank has a combination of Skills and Talents, which you may purchase with xp.

You may buy Advances from any Rank Advancement Scheme that you currently or have previously held.

As your Rank rises, you have access to more and more Advancement Schemes, and therefore have more options on how to customize your character.

As with Characteristic Advances, it is easy to gain Ranks to start with, and becomes progressively harder throughout the life of your character.

Each Career Path has unique Ranks. As your character progresses in power, you may sometimes find yourself eligible for two or more Ranks. When this occurs, you must make a choice between the Ranks available to you.

Some of the greater Ranks have prerequisites attached to them. These are things like Skills, Characteristic levels, or previous Ranks that you must possess before you can choose a particular Rank.

Career Rank tables look like this:

# **Gaining Ranks**

Characters automatically gain Ranks by spending xp. Once a character's total spent xp reaches the necessary amount, the character's Rank increases. Note, Rank increases always occur after an Advance has been taken.

# **Example**

*Steve's Guardsman character has spent 2,800 xp in total on advances. Steve decides to spend a further 500 xp to increase one of his Characteristics. Steve gains permission from his GM to take the advance, then crosses 500 xp off his current xp score. He then notes down the name of the advance, and alters his Characteristic profile. Finally, he adds the 500 xp he has spent to his total xp score. Steve has now spent 3,300 xp (2,800+500=3,300). Looking at the Guardsman Ranks, he sees he has now spent enough xp to earn a new Rank, Veteran. He removes his old Rank and notes "Veteran" on the Rank section of his Character Sheet.*

# **SKILL AND TALENT ADVANCES**

A Skill Advance teaches you a new Skill or improves an existing Skill to make it more effective. A Talent Advance gives you a knack or aptitude for something.

Depending on your career choice, some Skills and Talents are easier to learn than others. A scholarly Adept, for example, would have to spend far fewer Experience Points to learn Logic than a Guardsman would. The wide range of Skills and Talents allows you to customize your character as you would wish.

# **Prerequisites**

If you take a look at the listed Advances for each Rank, you'll notice some require you to have a Talent or a Characteristic at a particular rating. You must meet all the listed prerequisites before purchasing the Advance. If you are ever in doubt about a prerequisite, ask your GM, who can overrule or change prerequisites as they wish.

# **BUYING AN ADVANCE**

Buying an Advance is simple. Once you have had a good look at your Advance schemes, and chosen what you want to buy, follow these steps:

1) Check with the GM to make sure the Advance you'd like is available (the GM may restrict certain Skills and Talents to meet the needs of the campaign, or he might offer a better option).

2) Deduct the Advance's cost from your current pool of Experience Points.

3) Write down the name of the Advance on the Advances section of your Character Sheet.

4) Apply any changes to Characteristics, Skills, Talents or Traits that the Advance brings.

5) Finally, add the spent xp to your total xp.

As you undertake adventures, you will earn more Experience Points as a reward for good role playing, completing missions and for coming up with clever ideas. These rewards allow you to buy further Advances for your character.

# **Deciding How to Advance Your Character**

Figuring out which Advances you should take can be a little daunting at first. Whilst Characteristic Advances are expensive, they do have wide-ranging effects on your character's ability. Meanwhile, Skills and Talents are relatively cheap and do open a lot of new opportunities. You will need to decide if you want to focus on improving your core abilities, concentrate on gaining Skills and Talents or forge a compromise between the two tactics.

You can expect to gain around 200 xp with each session of play, provided you are reasonably successful and role play well. When planning your Advances you might find it handy to use this as a measure of how long it will take you to gain a certain improvement. For example, a Simple +5 Weapon Skill Advancement which costs 250 xp will take roughly two sessions to gain. Meanwhile, a new Talent which costs 100 xp could be gained after only a single session of play. If you get stuck, or simply aren't sure which would be a better Advance for your character, ask your GM to help you out.

# **Elite Advances**

Your character is broadly described by their Career Path, however the Advancements listed are not the sum total of all that your character could learn. Sometimes your character will be exposed to certain Skills or Talents during play. For example you might spend an adventure living amongst the dialect-jabbering Yakzi nomad tribe, or riding strange xeno beasts. If you think that you have a good reason for learning a Skill or Talent not listed on your Advancement Scheme you can request an Elite Advance from your GM. To make a request you will need the following:

• Logical justification for the Elite Advance—e.g. "I've spent 3 months with the tribe, so it makes sense I would pick up the Speak Language (Yakzi Tribe Dialect) skill."

•In-character explanation for howyou gained theAdvance—e.g."I was taught by one of the cauldron-maidens who took a shine to me".

• An offer of how many experience points you are willing to pay to gain the Advance—e.g. "I'll happily pay 200 xp to learn Speak Language (Yakzi Tribe Dialect) skill".

Your GM may decide not to grant you the Elite Advance, or request a higher Experience Point cost than you have suggested. In these cases, gracious acceptance of the GM's decree is the best course. Your GM may also rule that you need to pass a series of tests in order to successfully learn the requested Skill or Talent. This will usually tie into your explanation for how you gained the Advance; e.g. "Make a Charm Test to convince the Yakzi cauldron-maiden that you are worth teaching". The quest for an Elite Advance can be an adventure in and of itself.

Sometimes your GM will offer you an opportunity to take an Elite Advance as part of the reward for completing an adventure. For example, you may have encountered a powerful psyker during your investigations. Having defeated the witch, your GM might offer you the chance to purchase Forbidden Lore (Warp). Sometimes these Elite Advances will come with additional side effects, such as Corruption or Insanity points. Think carefully before taking up such an offer!

Occasionally, you can gain Elite Advances as the consequence of specific acts, such as making a pact with Daemonic forces. See **Chapter VIII: The Game Master** for more information on Elite Advances and Dark Pacts.

# **Creating Your Own Career Paths**

Whilst the Career Paths detailed here are purposely broad in scope, once you've had some experience adventuring within the 41st Millennium, you might find it fun to develop something a little more specific. Perhaps you feel like making up an alien race, or maybe you've always wanted to be a Grox Herder. If this is the case, work closely with your GM to develop an Advance scheme that is balanced and sensible. Remember to make sure that your new career fits in with the other members of your group—after all, if Acolytes cannot work smoothly together, mutants, aliens, and the forces of darkness will be only too happy to exploit your weaknesses.

# **Completing all the Ranks**

Through a combination of skill, caution and sheer luck, your character may survive the manifold horrors of the 41st Millennium long enough to progress to the top Rank within their career. In game terms, the character who has attained the top Rank of their career is considered to have completed their Career Path. The character has now passed beyond the scope of Dark Heresy, and into the realms of other *Warhammer 40,000* role playing games.

It might be that such a character is invited to become an Interrogator (after suitable purifying rituals of course) or that they might find a way to escape their master altogether. Perhaps they will be given a role within the Imperium as a planetary governor, Administratum official or Ecclesiarchy pontiff. Some might simply retire, whilst others might choose to plunder the far-flung stars with a Rogue Trader crew. Some might become nothing more than whispered legend and infamy. There are many options, only limited by your imagination.
