# Chapter II: Career Paths

*"There is no greater glory than a lifetime of dutiful service."* — Imperial adage.

As an Acolyte of the Inquisition, you are apart from everyone else in the Imperium of Man. Humanity toils and prays, forever ignorant of the great forces threatening to destroy the galaxy. Whilst they go about their lives, Acolytes like you wage a secret war against malefic beings whose names must never be spoken. Whilst the masses sleep at night, you are investigating secretive cults who meet in darkness to spill blood and pray to their obscene gods. As they slave in the manufactorum, you are bringing righteous fire to twisted mutants in the depths of a hive. As they peer fearfully at the blackness of space, you are plunging into the very darkness between the stars, uncovering ancient horrors upon planets long dead. You of all the teeming billions have been chosen to serve at the Emperor's left hand. Yours is a weighty duty, yet a vital one.

Not all Acolytes serve the Inquisition in the same way. Sometimes an Inquisitor has need of capable Guardsmen who can purge a nest of xenos cultists or an Arbitrator who can wring the truth from a petty thief. Sometimes an Inquisitor will need the services of an Adept to translate an ancient tome of knowledge or perhaps he must resort to dealing with Scum to get what he needs.

Your Career Path represents your character's abilities and potential—effectively, your role within an Inquisitor's retinue. It defines what you were before you joined the Inquisition, and how you will continue to develop. Your career will define how you are viewed, what new abilities you can learn, as well as the sorts of things you will be getting up to. Part of the fun of Dark Heresy is deciding exactly how your character will develop within your Career Path, for there are many choices available and no one "right" way of progressing.

# Getting GETTING STARTED

*"Serve the Emperor today, for tomorrow you may be dead!"* — *Lexiconum Moralis*.

Your character's Career Path is decided during the character creation process. Your choice of Home World will determine what paths are available to your character. You may decide to pick your Career Path for yourself, or to use the random tables in **Chapter I: Character Creation** to choose for you.

Each Career Path has its own dedicated section within this chapter. Once you know what path your character is following, take the time to have a good read through the appropriate section. This will tell you all the important things you need to know about playing your character, and how you can expect them to develop over time.

| Table 2-1: Careers |                                      |

# **CAREER PATH FORMAT**

Each Career Path uses the following format:

# **Description**

In each Career Path section you can find a description and illustration to help give you some ideas about what your character might be like. This section tells you a little bit about the background for the career and how it fits into the Imperium as a whole.

# **Rank Chart**

Each Career Path is divided into a series of Ranks. This chart tells you the name of each Rank, as well as the level of progression necessary to reach a certain Rank.

# **Characteristic Advance Scheme**

Each Career Path allows you to improve your character's raw abilities, or Characteristics. Depending on the nature of the Career Path, some Characteristics are more difficult to increase than others. This chart lists the cost of each Characteristic Advance you can take.

# **Rank Advance Scheme**

For each Rank within your Career Path you will find a table that shows you what new abilities your character can learn, and what you must do in order to learn them. You'll also find a short quote and description for each Rank.

# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENTS

*"Thought for the day: hard work conquers everything."* — *The Gunmetallicus Primer*.

A As you adventure through the 41st Millennium, your character will have plenty of opportunity to improve. Your Game Master will reward you with Experience Points that you can spend to further develop your character. Each career has plenty of room for you to customize your character and make them unique.

There are three types of improvement that can happen to your character:

- Characteristic Advance—Increases your raw abilities
- Rank increase—Opens new training opportunities
- Skill or Talent Advance—Learn new Skills or Talents

In addition to the Advances listed for the Ranks within your Career Path, sometimes your GM will allow you to purchase an Elite Advance.

# **CHARACTERISTIC ADVANCE**

A Characteristic Advance is an increase to your character's raw abilities. When you buy a Characteristic Advance, you add +5 to the Characteristic on your character sheet.

Characteristic Advancements are divided into four progression levels. These are as follows:

**Simple:** A small fulfilment of your potential.

**Intermediate:** A significant improvement to your capabilities. **Trained:** Active, focused effort upon improving one's prowess. **Expert:** The limit of your natural capabilities.

As you set about increasing a Characteristic, you must progress through each of the progression levels in turn, starting at Simple and ending with Expert.

The costs for each career are listed in the relevant career section in a table, which looks like this:

# **Arbitrator Characteristic Advance Scheme**

**Characteristic Simple Intermediate Trained Expert** WS 250 xp 500 xp 750 xp 1,000 xp

As you can see, the first +5 increase to an Arbitrator's Weapon Skill costs 250 xp; the next +5 (the Intermediate progression level) would cost 500 xp; a further +5 improvement (the Trained progression level) would cost 750 xp; while the final possible improvement (Expert progression level) costs 1,000 xp.

The costs for Characteristic Advances are cumulative. So you couldn't just pay 500 xp for a +10 increase. Instead, you'd pay 250 xp for the Simple Advance, and then pay 500 xp for the Intermediate Advance.

# **Example**

*Steve decides he wants to improve his Arbitrator's Weapon Skill. His starting profile is 25. Steve wishes to increase it to 35. Looking at the Characteristic Advance Scheme for the Arbitrator career, Steve notes the cost of a Simple progression is 250 xp. He purchases this advance, and increases his Weapon Skill to 30 (25+5=30). Next, Steve notes the cost of an Intermediate progression, which costs 500 xp. He purchases this advance, increasing his Weapon Skill from 30 to 35 (30+5=35). In total Steve has paid 750 xp to increase his Weapon Skill by 10 (250+500=750).*

# **RANKS**

Your Rank is a general measure of your experience and capabilities. It represents the progression of your character's abilities as they try to prove themselves worthy of Inquisitorial status. Your Rank is determined by the total amount of Experience Points your character has spent. The Advancement Scheme for each Rank has a combination of Skills and Talents, which you may purchase with xp.

You may buy Advances from any Rank Advancement Scheme that you currently or have previously held.

As your Rank rises, you have access to more and more Advancement Schemes, and therefore have more options on how to customize your character.

As with Characteristic Advances, it is easy to gain Ranks to start with, and becomes progressively harder throughout the life of your character.

Each Career Path has unique Ranks. As your character progresses in power, you may sometimes find yourself eligible for two or more Ranks. When this occurs, you must make a choice between the Ranks available to you.

Some of the greater Ranks have prerequisites attached to them. These are things like Skills, Characteristic levels, or previous Ranks that you must possess before you can choose a particular Rank.

Career Rank tables look like this:

# **Gaining Ranks**

Characters automatically gain Ranks by spending xp. Once a character's total spent xp reaches the necessary amount, the character's Rank increases. Note, Rank increases always occur after an Advance has been taken.

# **Example**

*Steve's Guardsman character has spent 2,800 xp in total on advances. Steve decides to spend a further 500 xp to increase one of his Characteristics. Steve gains permission from his GM to take the advance, then crosses 500 xp off his current xp score. He then notes down the name of the advance, and alters his Characteristic profile. Finally, he adds the 500 xp he has spent to his total xp score. Steve has now spent 3,300 xp (2,800+500=3,300). Looking at the Guardsman Ranks, he sees he has now spent enough xp to earn a new Rank, Veteran. He removes his old Rank and notes "Veteran" on the Rank section of his Character Sheet.*

# **SKILL AND TALENT ADVANCES**

A Skill Advance teaches you a new Skill or improves an existing Skill to make it more effective. A Talent Advance gives you a knack or aptitude for something.

Depending on your career choice, some Skills and Talents are easier to learn than others. A scholarly Adept, for example, would have to spend far fewer Experience Points to learn Logic than a Guardsman would. The wide range of Skills and Talents allows you to customize your character as you would wish.

# **Prerequisites**

If you take a look at the listed Advances for each Rank, you'll notice some require you to have a Talent or a Characteristic at a particular rating. You must meet all the listed prerequisites before purchasing the Advance. If you are ever in doubt about a prerequisite, ask your GM, who can overrule or change prerequisites as they wish.

# **BUYING AN ADVANCE**

Buying an Advance is simple. Once you have had a good look at your Advance schemes, and chosen what you want to buy, follow these steps:

1) Check with the GM to make sure the Advance you'd like is available (the GM may restrict certain Skills and Talents to meet the needs of the campaign, or he might offer a better option).

2) Deduct the Advance's cost from your current pool of Experience Points.

3) Write down the name of the Advance on the Advances section of your Character Sheet.

4) Apply any changes to Characteristics, Skills, Talents or Traits that the Advance brings.

5) Finally, add the spent xp to your total xp.

As you undertake adventures, you will earn more Experience Points as a reward for good role playing, completing missions and for coming up with clever ideas. These rewards allow you to buy further Advances for your character.

# **Deciding How to Advance Your Character**

Figuring out which Advances you should take can be a little daunting at first. Whilst Characteristic Advances are expensive, they do have wide-ranging effects on your character's ability. Meanwhile, Skills and Talents are relatively cheap and do open a lot of new opportunities. You will need to decide if you want to focus on improving your core abilities, concentrate on gaining Skills and Talents or forge a compromise between the two tactics.

You can expect to gain around 200 xp with each session of play, provided you are reasonably successful and role play well. When planning your Advances you might find it handy to use this as a measure of how long it will take you to gain a certain improvement. For example, a Simple +5 Weapon Skill Advancement which costs 250 xp will take roughly two sessions to gain. Meanwhile, a new Talent which costs 100 xp could be gained after only a single session of play. If you get stuck, or simply aren't sure which would be a better Advance for your character, ask your GM to help you out.

# **Elite Advances**

Your character is broadly described by their Career Path, however the Advancements listed are not the sum total of all that your character could learn. Sometimes your character will be exposed to certain Skills or Talents during play. For example you might spend an adventure living amongst the dialect-jabbering Yakzi nomad tribe, or riding strange xeno beasts. If you think that you have a good reason for learning a Skill or Talent not listed on your Advancement Scheme you can request an Elite Advance from your GM. To make a request you will need the following:

• Logical justification for the Elite Advance—e.g. "I've spent 3 months with the tribe, so it makes sense I would pick up the Speak Language (Yakzi Tribe Dialect) skill."

•In-character explanation for howyou gained theAdvance—e.g."I was taught by one of the cauldron-maidens who took a shine to me".

• An offer of how many experience points you are willing to pay to gain the Advance—e.g. "I'll happily pay 200 xp to learn Speak Language (Yakzi Tribe Dialect) skill".

Your GM may decide not to grant you the Elite Advance, or request a higher Experience Point cost than you have suggested. In these cases, gracious acceptance of the GM's decree is the best course. Your GM may also rule that you need to pass a series of tests in order to successfully learn the requested Skill or Talent. This will usually tie into your explanation for how you gained the Advance; e.g. "Make a Charm Test to convince the Yakzi cauldron-maiden that you are worth teaching". The quest for an Elite Advance can be an adventure in and of itself.

Sometimes your GM will offer you an opportunity to take an Elite Advance as part of the reward for completing an adventure. For example, you may have encountered a powerful psyker during your investigations. Having defeated the witch, your GM might offer you the chance to purchase Forbidden Lore (Warp). Sometimes these Elite Advances will come with additional side effects, such as Corruption or Insanity points. Think carefully before taking up such an offer!

Occasionally, you can gain Elite Advances as the consequence of specific acts, such as making a pact with Daemonic forces. See **Chapter VIII: The Game Master** for more information on Elite Advances and Dark Pacts.

# **Creating Your Own Career Paths**

Whilst the Career Paths detailed here are purposely broad in scope, once you've had some experience adventuring within the 41st Millennium, you might find it fun to develop something a little more specific. Perhaps you feel like making up an alien race, or maybe you've always wanted to be a Grox Herder. If this is the case, work closely with your GM to develop an Advance scheme that is balanced and sensible. Remember to make sure that your new career fits in with the other members of your group—after all, if Acolytes cannot work smoothly together, mutants, aliens, and the forces of darkness will be only too happy to exploit your weaknesses.

# **Completing all the Ranks**

Through a combination of skill, caution and sheer luck, your character may survive the manifold horrors of the 41st Millennium long enough to progress to the top Rank within their career. In game terms, the character who has attained the top Rank of their career is considered to have completed their Career Path. The character has now passed beyond the scope of Dark Heresy, and into the realms of other *Warhammer 40,000* role playing games.

It might be that such a character is invited to become an Interrogator (after suitable purifying rituals of course) or that they might find a way to escape their master altogether. Perhaps they will be given a role within the Imperium as a planetary governor, Administratum official or Ecclesiarchy pontiff. Some might simply retire, whilst others might choose to plunder the far-flung stars with a Rogue Trader crew. Some might become nothing more than whispered legend and infamy. There are many options, only limited by your imagination.

# Adept

*"It's simple really. If we place the signifier here in this position, the rest of the cipher solves itself."*

— Scholar Gabel Troken, Librarium Centris, Scintilla.

The Administratum is a vast, monolithic organisation and the largest, most powerful of all the divisions that make up the Adeptus Terra. It is said the Adeptus Terra is the cogs and gears that drive the Imperium, and the Administratum is the grease and oil that smooths and coats the machinery. Without the Administratum, the gears of the Adeptus Terra would grind to a halt and the Imperium would fail.

Billions staff the Administratum, the majority of which are adepts of varying grades and specialties. Many are in hereditary positions, the titles passed down from generation to generation. Such is the immense size of the Administratum, it has been known for whole departments to become lost in a sea of complex bureaucracy only to resurface centuries later. Entire divisions have been founded and dogmatically continue to exist, even after their original intent has long since expired.

Most adepts labouring within the gargantuan vaults, forgotten archive halls or sitting at ancient, parchment-reading, logic engines are considered to be learned by Imperial standards. They range from studious librarians, who have spent their entire lives within the dusty confines of manuscript-filled archives, to younger, knowledge-hungry scholars ambitious to climb the multitudinous ranks of the Administratum.

Inquisitors and their agents frequently have need of such academics, archivists, curators, scribes, logisters, translators, and all manner of specialists in lore. Adepts become involved with an Inquisitor in many ways: some may already be in service within the Inquisition, others may unwittingly cross paths during an Inquisitor's investigation, but the majority of adepts are seconded from the Administratum. For an ageing scholar, used to a rigid and dogmatic routine, entering the employ of an Inquisitor is an intimidating experience. Some are reluctant, but see it as an important duty that must be fulfilled. Others can become resentful, making it clear they are only in service out of fear and loss of status rather than any idealist sense of saving the Imperium. Not all react negatively: Some, often younger, adepts see it as an opportunity, a rare chance to leave the overbearing structures of the Administratum and quench their thirst for curiosity, and study forbidden knowledge.

In the field, adepts are rarely armed with anything more than an autopistol; firepower is someone else's job. They are present to give sage tactical advice, unlock codes, confirm the existence of STC data or brief on local customs and rituals. Their role may not be in the forefront of a firefight but it is no less pivotal or dangerous. Whilst other Acolytes can secure a heavily defended data-crypt with firepower and psychic force, someone needs to download and decipher the data from the terminal in the midst of the combat.

Adepts may be thought of as meek when compared to other Acolytes, but they have access to one of the most powerful weapons in the 41st Millennium—knowledge.

| Fellowship                               | 250    | 500          | 750     | 1,000  |  |

# **Archivist Advances**

*"Throne blind you boy, fetch those books before I use your hide for a binding!"*

Archivists keep manuscripts and tend the needs of Sages, scurrying between tottering bookshelves and datacrypts, ever with an eye to escaping their servitude.

# **Scrivener Advances**

*"Dharkins, your illuminations are positively Rabeliean. You'll do well; just not here."*

Scriveners have wormed their way into a position of trust, whence they may actually deal with scrolls, books and data-slates directly. Of course, they are the primary oppres sors of Archivists, as is only right and proper.

# **Scribe Advances**

*"A scribe is always useful. Knowledge can make the difference between life and death, particularly if you send the scribe in first…"*

Scribes are vessels of knowledge, skilled in the byzantine art of extracting information from all manner of sources. Many secretly fear they will never rise further within the ranks of the Administratum, hence they are naturally keen to take risks to get ahead.

# **Inditor Advances**

*"If you've a mind to dig to the bottom of something, an inditor is invaluable. If they don't know it, they can find it out for you. If they can't find it… well, you're probably not meant to know it anyway."*

Inditors are trusted members of the Administratum, having been initiated into some of its deeper secrets. Even the lore of other Adepta is not beyond their scrutinising gaze.

# Arbitrator Arbitrator

*"He demands? The demands of the law come first, even in Hive Tarsus."*

— Regulator Hanz Rikennan, IVth Precinct, Hive Tarsus.

T Throughout the millions of worlds of the Imperium, crime is rife. Not just the petty crimes of individuals for personal gain, but organised crime on a scale never even considered in humanity's past. Entire sub-sectors and planets have been in the thrall of illegal cartels and criminal organisations. There are even wayward planetary governors who shun the Imperium and treat the dominion as their own paltry fiefdom, claiming the planet's natural resources, labour and riches for their own.

> In these dire situations it falls to the Adeptus Arbites to defend the Imperium's rights and prevent whole sub-sectors going rogue for generations, or even permanently. The Adeptus Arbites is not a galactic police force; it has little interest in petty crimes such as theft, murder or tax evasion, for these fall under the responsibility of the local planetary forces. The Adeptus Arbites is there to keep order on a far greater scale, to root out corruption, maintain the Imperial tithe and to guard against witchery.

> From the Adeptus Arbites come the fearsome Arbitrators. Also known as Judges, these men and women are stoic in their duty and unquestionably loyal to the Imperium. Inquisitors often go to the Adeptes Arbites when in need of a trustworthy Acolyte, trained to think on their feet, combat-hardened and beyond reproach in their faith. Arbitrators are infamous for their prodigious stamina and zeal, and their ability to survive all manner of wounds and punishment in the quest to catch their quarry.

> Arbitrators are resolute and fearless. They demand utter obedience from the citizens they come into contact with. Where civil unrest and crime threaten the stability of a world, the Arbitrators are in the field: unflinching, ordering the local enforcers, and hunting down the rabble-rousers, to restore law and order.

> The Judges' methods are varied, not unlike the way Inquisitors go about their work. The means used can be different depending on their mentors, what Schola Progenium the individual attended and other such factors. However, unlike Inquisitors who have their own private agendas, all members of the Adeptes Arbites have the same goal and responsibility—to uphold the Emperor's justice.

> Some Arbitrators openly investigate and make no secret who their quarry is, even if he is of noble birth or high rank. This can often lead to overt hostility between the Judge and his subject, although there is no question who off-world forces of the Imperium would side with should they be requested to attend. This is by no means the only mode of investigation; other officers of the Adeptes Arbites are quite methodical in their approach—meticulously sourcing evidence and questioning contacts and witnesses.

> The relationship between the Inquisition and the Adeptes Arbites is often one of the more cordial within the Adeptus Terra. Arbitrators often see working with Inquisitors as a way of further enforcing justice. However, such arrangements have not always worked so well. It has been known for Judges to turn on the Inquisitors they have been seconded to serve if they perceive the Inquisitor to have broken sacrosanct Imperial laws. This means Inquisitors of the more Radical factions must be wary when recruiting members of the Adeptus Arbites to become their Acolytes.

# **Magistrate Advances**

*"Every crime has its price, and the magistrate collects that debt."*

Magistrates rule upon intricate cases of heresy and sedition. By dispensing death, they keep the soul of the Imperium alive.

# **Justicar Advances**

*"Where Justicar tread, nobles tremble."*

The Justicar brings the light of the Emperor's judgement to decadent nobles, corrupt officials and worlds brought low by dark worship.

# **Proctor Advances**

*"Open fire!"*

Proctors lead Adeptes Arbites riot squads and suppression forces against highly armed, and highly foolish, criminals.

# **Marshal Advances**

*"When a Marshal arrives, blood and gun smoke follow."*

Marshals take the rule of law to the darkest dens of scum and depravity, dispensing justice in a bright arc of muzzle flare.

# **Lord Marshal Advances**

*"Such men are beyond mere mercy."*

As the Imperium is mighty, so too is the Lord Marshal. His will is not blunted by the petty whims of circumstance. The cold rule of law is his only measure, and woe betide those that fall short.

# Assassin

*"When I kill, it is beautiful—an art form older than any painting or sculpture."*

— Lyra Trix, Malfian Noble House Assassin.

I I n the Imperium assassination is a valued tool and it is used by all, from the agencies of the Adepta down to petty crime lords of the underhives—a professional killer is always in demand. Such individuals can range from freelancers, who are self-taught, to members of Assassin Orders and Guilds.

Assassins come in all shapes and guises, and it is often the person a potential target least expects that is their killer. These can range from unsubtle brutes, who will crush every bone in the target's body, to mundane-looking everymen who practise the use of potions and poisons, and are able to slip a deadly concoction into the unsuspecting target's next meal.

There are many Orders, Guilds and Death Cults that thrive in the Imperium. Though there will be an element of penitence to the Emperor, in the duties they perform the Orders are either a functioning off-shoot of some monolithic Adepta or may even have a commercial interest, so some sort funding or tithe would be required to gain their services. Unbeknownst to even the aspirants that belong to these semilegal organisations and cults most, if not all, are fronts for the Assassin Temples that form the highly secretive Officio Assassinorum, for this is where the Temple Masters recruit and induct the most promising individuals.

The Assassins of such Orders are highly trained killers capable of feats far and above that of mere humans. Whether a Death Cultist or member of an Assassin Order, they are experts in exotic weaponry but they also have intimate knowledge of other lethal crafts, such as the use of poisons and the creation of fatal booby traps. The methods, demeanour and personality of an Assassin can vary as much as there are ways to kill, though this will be heavily influenced by the teachings and training, be it from a Death Cult or Order.

If an Assassin survives long enough into his career and his superiors deem him worthy, he will be unknowingly tested. The trials are likely extremely lethal, and so those who are found lacking are unlikely to survive. The few who do successfully make it through the trials become initiates in one of the Assassin Temples, although the Assassin is unaware of this even at this stage, such is the secrecy surrounding the Officio Assassinorum.

# **Assassin Advances**

*"I think Lord Varcus needs to be reminded of his place; perhaps it is time he was introduced to our mutual friend."*

Assassination is a constant throughout the Imperium and an accepted political tool on countless worlds. The absolute rule of many planetary governors is often enforced at the tip of an assassin's blade.

#### **Death Adept Advances**

*"Your screams are as music, and your blood is as wine to me."*

The Death Adept pursues killing as an art form, training themselves into a perfection of martial grace and death. Many Death Adepts no longer kill for money or on the whim of their masters, but rather to indulge in the purity of death itself.

# **Freeblade Advances**

*"I thought it was Ferstin coming to relieve us, at least until he shot Jyanus in the face. Turned out Ferstin had been dead for days."*

A Freeblade is an infiltrator, skilled in disguise and deception. His tactics include confusing his enemies and leaving them jumping at shadows while he closes in for the kill.

# **Nihilator Advances**

*"He killed and killed and killed, and all the time the bastard had that blood-soaked grin on his face."*

A Nihilator takes the philosophy of the Death Adept a step further, embracing the act of murder, the almost religious moment when they wrest the life from their victims. Only the extinguishing of another's life fills the Nihilator with purpose, stirring his spirit and touching his soul.

# **Imperator-Mortis Advances**

*"I am death incarnate."*

The Imperator-Mortis is an embodiment of graceful slaughter, an angel of death with few peers.

# Cleric Cleric

*"By the Saints and the Sigillite himself! If you don't move, I'll take this hammer to your head!"*

— Preacher Silon Constantine, Fenksworld.

T The Adeptus Ministorum, or Ecclesiarchy, tends to the religious needs of the Imperium. It is completely separate from the Adeptus Terra, concerned with looking after mankind's spiritual needs rather than maintaining a galaxy-spanning empire. Nevertheless, the Ecclesiarchy is a vast and powerful institution comprising of millions of clergymen and hundreds of thousands of dioceses spread across the far reaches of Imperial space. In the past this has led the Ecclesiarchy into abuses of power and outright civil war, such as the Age of Apostasy. Yet the Ministorum endures, guiding humanity in its superstitious and dogmatic worship of the Emperor.

At the forefront of this vast church are the clerics, preachers, confessors and missionaries. Unlike the cardinals and pontifex that scurry around the ancient corridors of the great cathedrals of Ancient Terra and Ophelia IV, the spiritual homes of the Ecclesiarchy, the clerics and other such clergy live and work amongst the population. It is here that they preach the word, spread the faith and shepherd the human race, for if they were negligent in such duties Chaos would take hold.

Clerics are fiery individuals, who l ead from t he front. They are charismatic men and great orators, able to incite and inspire common folk with their speeches, commanding loyalty, respect and wonder in the Emperor and His ordained servants. On many occasions the Imperium has used such men to rouse populations to action at a critical moment of a foul xenos invasion or to flush out a deep-rooted Chaos cult.

A Cleric has many skills, he is an orator, can hold his own in combat and is wise. However, such a broad base of skills means that they rarely specialise. Still, there are those within the Ministorum that follow a path long after others have moved on to learn a new lesson. This breeds such diverse clergy from overly suspicious zealots, who see heresy around every corner and stir up entire populations to burn innocents on a burning pyre, to those who will steep themselves in ancient lore, spending years in great dusty catacombs studying ageing scrolls on pointless intricacies of ceremonies and rituals.

Despite many attempts by numerous Ecclesiarchs, the Ministorium has gained many disparate groups and ideals. Although all have the common theme of worshiping Him-On-Earth, it is in the details of how to pursue that faith where such disagreements and inconsistencies arise. Over the years, this has spawned numerous different orders within the Ecclesiarchy; the majority of clerics belong to one of the different orders and this has a profound effect on how the clergyman performs his duties and preaches to the masses. Although never acknowledged publicly, it has been rumoured that occasionally these orders have gone to war with each other, though open bloodshed is rare.

Inquisitors find Clerics useful Acolytes as their abilities to interact with, and influence, the local population have proved valuable on many occasions. From a Cleric's point of view his reasons for shunning the duties of the Ministorum and becoming an agent of the Inquisition can be manifold. Some see it as a form of penance; others view Inquisitors with awe and unthinkingly follow these most worthy of the Emperor's servants; the more zealous see service with an Inquisitor as a way of fighting heretics up close, the chance to purge the galaxy of foul deviants too much of an opportunity to ignore.

#### **Novice Advances**

*"Do you think Saint Thrastus complained when he was strung up by his petard? No! Not one word! That's piety. Now get on with your work, you little ingrate."*

Novices serve the Ecclesiar chy body and soul, looking to the examples of the Impe rial saints to inspire acts of greatness. They also serve those higher than them selves in the Ecclesiarchy (which is quite a few people indeed).

# **Initiate Advances**

*"Even the lowly initiate may become a martyr, if his will be strong enough."*

Initiates are instructed to defend the Cult of the Emperor with more than simple words, so that the Emperor's light may be brought to the ignorant and truculent.

A Preacher learns to lead men, to inspire and guide mankind, and to drive the word of the Ecclesiarchy home—upon the teeth of an eviscerator if need be.

# Guardsman

*"We go in, kill anything that moves and then blow the structure with a demo charge."*

— Eli Plex, Assault Veteran of the Secondus 21st.

N No matter how subtle the Acolytes may go about their investigation, at some point talking, stealth, and the use of cunning cease and the need for sheer brute force will be called upon. This is the Guardsmen's role. They are a tough, ruthless bunch, experts in field craft and various ranged weaponry—anything from the humble lasgun to the sophisticated sniper rifle.

Known as the Hammer of the Emperor, the Imperial Guard is the largest fighting force in the history of the galaxy. It is made up of billions upon billions of soldiers, all recruited from the many worlds of the Imperium. The Departmento Munitorum is tasked with supervising, supplying and sourcing the regiments of the Imperial Guard but even this organisation has no idea of exactly how many troops are under arms as the continuous toll of casualties and influx of recruits will run into millions in a single day. The Guard regiments come from many different planets and their native cultures, style of dress, technological background and warrior traditions are all different too. The Guard does not even try to impose a standard uniform, preferring to exploit the unique strength of each company, be it a tribal warrior clan, or a highly drilled and regimented unit of Cadians. To this end there is no formal training; each regiment is trusted to instruct their own troops in the war craft they have developed in their own culture. In fact, the only kind of unity within the Imperial Guard is the use of standard equipment such as the lasgun.

It is from this vast army that Inquisitors will recruit the muscle they often need to go about their duties. Because each regiment is so different, a Guardsman can vary wildly—some are professional, elite stormtroopers; others could be hardened gangers from murky industrial worlds, most likely already killers before even being inducted into the Guard; others still could be axewielding, blood-drinking savages from a far-flung feral world.

Inquisitors will second Guardsmen mainly for their combat experience and expertise with weapons, although their choice may often be influenced if the would-be Acolytes have a secondary set of skills—albeit with a battlefield application. For instance, Guardsmen are frequently trained to be able to drive and maintain vehicles, may have triage and medical expertise or even be competent in the use of communications equipment.

Not all Guardsmen—or the role the Inquisitors define by that label—actually come straight from the Imperial Guard. Some may have crossed paths with the Inquisitor as hired thugs for another agency. Some are wayward mercenaries who have spent their lives as a hired gun, only to be pressed into service of the Inquisition. Others still are hive gangers that may have had the gall to ambush an Inquisitor on his rare travels into an underhive. No matter what the origin, a Guardsman's role within the cell is always that of combat and fire-control.

*"You think this is bad, kid? Just wait till the big guns start!"*

Veterans hold their own upon the battlefield, in spiring others with their prowess, fearlessness and sheer killing power. Their battle wisdom is indis pensable, and their luck proven by their continu ing vitality.

#### **Assault Veteran Advances**

*"It's going to get close and messy lads, stay close to me and don't be afraid to get it on ya…"*

Freedom is bought at the point of a blade, and Assault Veterans know this all too well. In the close press of fighting, they wield their chainblades with deadly efficiency.

#### **Lieutenant Advances**

*"Watch your formation and stay sharp!"*

Lieutenants lead their men into glorious battle. It falls to an officer to accept the weight of command and responsibilities for success of failure on the battlefield.

# **Scout Advances**

*"I swear dead men make more noise than that bastard."*

Scouts are adept at locating the enemy in all terrain. They are keen observers, and skilled in the art of stealth.

# **Shock Trooper Advances**

*"The heretics were still reeling from the door charges when the shock troopers hit them."*

Shock Troopers know how to storm bunkers and lay down their life for the Emperor. They are well armed, well trained, and well feared.

# **Captain Advances**

*"Squad Five! I want suppressing fire on that blockhouse! Squad Seven, move into flanking positions!"*

Captains command large formations and battle groups. The skill of a bold Captain is vital to any successful attack or defence.

# **Marksman Advances**

*"I may not look much but I can take out your left eye with this baby from a thousand yards."*

Most Imperial forces include a Marksman to support the rest of its members with accurate long-range fire support. They are adept at digging in and picking off the enemy.

*"Storm troopers? Them thronegroaning glory boys get all the prime action—and all the credit, too. Don't listen to the propaganda it's us regular Guard that does all the grit-work."*

# **Commander Advances**

*"Men of the Imperium stand tall, for you are the favoured of the Emperor!"*

Commanders control the entire flow of battle, from planning to execution. Imperial Commanders have at their disposal the greatest armies in the known galaxy, and the cold, hard determination to use them.

# **Sniper Advances**

*"There's something really satisfying about making a man's head explode like a blood melon. All in the name of the Emperor of course."*

Snipers are masters of their art, able to kill at a distance, then melt away from view. They are silent, skilled and often have a grim sense of humour. Many find them hard to understand.

# Scum

*"You see, you've won again. I told you I was no good at cards. I'll play one more round, but only because you insist."* 
— Reetheus Orl, Barking Saint, Hive Sibellius.

A As has always been the case, the flotsam and jetsam of humanity seems to attract each other and thrives in the darkest of places. The Imperium is a vast and unforgivably hard regime to subsist in, and so the unwanted and uncared for fester and even flourish in the most unlikely and inhospitable places. The underhives, deserted hab-blocks and even entire moons that are now robbed of any valuable resource, hold what the enforcers collectively call scum. They are mankind's detritus, who have no place in Imperial society—even the Ecclesiarchy seems to have given up on them, although some missionaries persist in trying to save their souls, even if their intercession is not requested!

Scum is a catch-all term that covers everything from thieves, Imperial Guard deserters, escaped penal convicts, confidence tricksters, fallen nobles, gangers, murderers, hab-rats and all manner of criminals and unsavoury characters. Despite the collective term, there are many who have skills Inquisitors find useful in their line of work. When an Inquisitor needs someone with low moral values, who will fire upon innocents when ordered or shoot someone in the back without a second thought, it is going to be the Acolyte who has spent his life on the fringes of the Imperial society.

As well as moral ambiguity, Scum often have more practical skills that come in use during an investigation. Breaking in to property unnoticed, finding black market goods, a mark that needs charming or a suspect intimidating are all talents that make the Acolytes' lives easier.

An Inquisitor does not pick just any felon he happens to stumble across to become his agent and to serve as an Acolyte the Scum must be trustworthy—to an extent—and their talents need to be considerable. He needs to be more than just a common ganger. Agents such as this can range from the nimble, double-jointed cat burglar, the fast-talking charmer who can play the long con, the card shark that never loses or the fence with contacts across the breadth of the sub-sector.

Having lived and survived in such tough conditions means that it will frequently be the Scum that is the source of some acrimony and he does not always get on with other Acolytes in the cell. His moral values and reasons for participating may be entirely different from the others and so make him a source of contention. Reasons why such a character may join the employ of an Inquisitor in the first place are manifold: some do it for the sheer thrill, some as sentence for some past crime, some are being paid, whilst others have the skills an Inquisitor needs and so are ordered or threatened to participate. For an Inquisitor it matters little what the motive is, as long as they fulfil their part in the mission. Inquisitors can, and will, use all tools necessary to carry out their duties, they do not care if that is using the highest-born noble or the most inhuman villain—it is the end goal that is important, not the method in achieving it.

#### **Dreg Advances**

*"Don't look at the dreg, Tarquis, you'll only encourage them."*

Beggars, thieves and baseborn scum: the dregs of society are nevertheless hardy and surprisingly capable.

# **Outcast Advances**

*"Them cretescreevin Outcast scum would swipe the chronometer off yer wrist as soon as look at yer."*

An Outcast has survived long enough outside the bounds of society to develop a certain rapport with the seedier side of life—as well as an ability to slink into the background when trouble comes their way.

*"There's some as is destined fer greatness… and some fer infamy. Either way, yer get yer face on the pict caster an' pretty young things will be wantin' ta make yer acquaintance."*

Toughened by all that life can throw at him, the Rogue is a smart, skilled and dangerous foe, never to be underestimated, and always to be watched carefully.

# **Cutter Advances**

*"Mark my muzzle, you go there and beg for forgiveness. If Lex sends a Cutter on you, there ain't a place in this hive or the next that'll take you in or save you."*

A bladesman, enforcer and bounty hunter, a Cutter is a dangerous person to have at your heels.

Savvy and brutal, Stubjacks specialise in ambush, robbery and turf war. Some lead gangs, others operate alone, but in all cases Stubjacks use strength, cunning and intimidating weapons to get what they want.

# **Gang Lord Advances**

*"The Robber-Monk they calls him, sleek as silver, twice as quick. Could steal your shadow while you're blinking, so they say. The Spire nobs are quaking in their boots. You mark my muzzle, there's more than one family safe that'll be cracked tonight!"*

The Gang Lord is skilled in high-stakes operations, from assassination to cat burglary and data-heists. He can put together a crew, or simply awe the local underworld with his low cunning and high returns.

# **Fixer Advances**

*"I know a fella… he could… sort you out. Course, he's mighty pricy, but you ain't in no place to bargain right now, are you?"*

The Fixer knows the art of finding things, and people, no matter how illegal, hidden or dangerous. A skilled fence, and deadly shot, the Fixer prowls the hiveways and city streets with the easy grace of a predator.

#### **Shark Advances**

*"Father, I write to beg you reconsider. If I were to invest the full sum of my inheritance, Mr Curzon could guarantee a full one hundred per cent return in the first year alone! These are not the claims of a fraud—I have inspected the mine with my own eyes!"*

Be it cards, cons or codes, Sharks prey on the foolish, proud and gullible. Masters of lies and misdirection, they fleece their targets with a smile.

#### **Charlata n Advances**

*"He seemed like such a nice young man…"*

The Charlatan is a master thief, who can bind even planetary governors to their web of elaborate deceit. Using sophisticated and long-term plans, they are architects of cunning subterfuges that put even the sharpest of lawmen on the back foot.

# Tech-Priest

*"Bzzttt… our alliance must terminate here—your objectives are no longer compatible with mine."*

— Quintass Delta III, Mech-Wright, The Lathes.

T The Cult Mechanicus holds a virtual monopoly on technology. Its tenets and beliefs permeate through their rituals into the common superstition of Imperial citizens. The Adeptus Mechanicus is run by the Tech-Priests of Mars, an insular priesthood that worship the Machine God and whose goal is to harvest all the lost technology that has been missing since before the Age of Strife. The lowest ranks of Tech-Priests have mainly maintenance and construction duties, but as a Tech-adept progresses and acquires greater knowledge, he is relieved from the more trivial day-to-day tasks and allowed to study and learn of the greater mysterious and missing techniques that have prevented any kind of progressive development in the Imperium's technological base.

All Tech-Priests have an advanced grasp of how to maintain most of the standard technologies that are used throughout the Imperium. There are also many specialities a Tech-Priest can study, such as the biologius, xenology and the use of rediscovered weaponry to name but a few.

Tech-Priests are not confined to Mars or the numerous Forge Worlds that are scattered throughout the galaxy. Many are given leave to seek out lost technologies or investigate rumoured sightings of STC templates. It is on these missions Tech-Priests most likely come into contact with an Inquisitor or a cell.

The relationship between the Inquisition and the Priesthood of Mars has been a stormy one, ranging from outright hostility to merely strained in less tumultuous times. Nevertheless, the two powerful organisations have worked together many times especially when it is perceived to be in the common interest. In these situations a Tech-Priest may be present in a cell. His knowledge of Imperial, and even xenos, technology will always prove useful. A Tech-Priest may even have the means, via a neural plug, to communicate directly with the machine spirit of certain technologies, making him a very desirable ally. However, the Tech-Priests are fiercely independent and distrustful of others who do not worship the Machine God; they will be cold, methodical and terse. A Tech-Priest Acolyte rarely fits in well with a team of non-Mechanicus personnel.

The appearance of Tech-Priests can be frightening, even terrorinducing, to those who have never had contact with such beings before. As much as fifty to sixty per cent of a Tech-Priest's body may have been replaced with bionics and even the addition of extra limbs like mechadendrites or in-built weaponry. This proportion of organic to machine parts increases as the Tech-Priest gets older. The Tech-Priests themselves explain that these changes bring them ever closer to their Machine God, the Omnissiah, and away from the weak frailties of the flesh. It is not uncommon for the most senior Tech-Priests, known as Magos, to be almost entirely machine, the last piece of withered organic material losing what was left of its humanity centuries ago. An Inquisitor is always wary when allying with a Magos as chances are they are following their own agenda, which is often quite separate from that of the other Acolytes.

# **Tech-Priest Abilities In Game Terms**

Whilst the abilities of Tech-Priests are a complicated blend of technology, mummery and religion, it is sometimes useful to know how to translate these seemingly miraculous powers into game terms.

As far as Player Characters are concerned, Tech-Priest powers are expressed in a very simple way. In Dark Heresy, each character in the Tech-Priest career starts play with the Mechanicus Implants trait. This represents the various augmentations that have been fitted inside the character. (See **[page 27](#page-27-0)** for the full details on each of these implants.) By spending Experience Points on various Talents, the character learns to use these implants to generate all sorts of effects, from bolts of bio-electrical energy to powerful magnetic fields.

The augmentations described in the Mechanicus Implants trait are so closely intertwined with the Tech-Priest's body they are not considered to be equipment. They are indistinguishable from his mortal flesh. These implants are such an integral part of a Tech-Priest that he would not survive their wholesale removal—or even want to. Life without them is no life at all. To all intents and purposes, a Tech-Priest's Wounds represent damage to both his soft tissue and these trait-specific augmentations. As a Tech-Priest heals damage, he is considered to be repairing any damage to this machinery as well as to his body.

In addition to these "free" augmentations, Tech-Priest Player Characters can also purchase other cybernetic implants, such as auger arrays, mechadendrites and bionic limbs. Unlike the augmentations granted by the Mechanicus Implants trait, these are treated just like any other cybernetic implant. They can be targeted, damaged, removed, or improved—see **Bionic Replacement Limbs & Body Parts** on **[page 153](#page-153-0)** for more details.

As ever, questions about the damage or removal of implants, and what this does to a Tech-Priest's Talents, should be adjudicated by the Game Master. No doubt this wise and august person will provide a common-sense answer, agreeable to all.

#### **Enginseer**

*"Yes, sir, I know the enginseer is annoyed, but we had to open the machine casing… yes, but we would have lost the Chimera if we didn't jury rig it… what? … demands penance? Front line you say? Throne… Well, if the Emperor commands…* "

Enginseers draw together their knowledge of form, energy and material compo nents into the art of tending complicated machines. Using the alchemy of prayer and ritual, they cajole machine spirits into life, finding faults and removing error from all manner of technology.

# **Tech-Priest**

*"He stood before the fan cyclers barefoot and humble. In the language of the Tech-Priests he bid the engines start, that the hive breathe easy. He struck the sacred rune, donned his boots once more, and lo! The fans began."*

Tech-Priests are initiated into the deeper mysteries of technology, and know many rites of maintenance, ignition and restarting. From simple door mechanisms to ancient tech dug from mouldering ruins, Tech-Priests seek out the many forms of the Omnissiah, to add yet more knowledge to the data crypts of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

# **Technomancer**

*"Minds sharp as knives, and know their way round the Administratum too. Don't cross a technomancer, especially if you work on a spaceship. You'll be reassigned to a leaky rig before you can sign the aquila."*

Technomancers apply all their considerable mental powers to extracting information that may be of use to the Machine Cult. Be it currying favour with the Ecclesiarchy to interrogation of xenos prisoners, Technomancers conjure answers with ruthless logical efficiency.

# **Cyber Seer**

*"They ain't quite human no more. I mean, more than yer average Tech-Priest. No one could keep all that… you know… dangerous stuff in their skull an' stay normal."*

Cyber Seers delve into the forbidden and occult matters of machinery with frightening zeal. From unnatural geometries to warp-touched autonoma, Cyber Seers do not shirk or sway from looking upon the damning and heretical in their quest for knowledge.

# **Omniprophet**

*"Hark unto the omniprophet! Get down on your knees and thank the air-recyks for their benediction. The very breath in your lungs is his blessing upon you! Pray, lest we cast you from the mine as a heretic!"*

The master of many trades, the Magos Errant is expected to go forth on behalf of the Adeptus Mechanicus, to explore new frontiers, worlds and technologies. Privy to all manner of secret knowledge, the Magos Errant is prepared for all eventualities.
