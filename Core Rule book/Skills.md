# SKILL INFORMATION

*"It is likely that I have forgotten more about the Imperium than you will ever know, acolyte."*
— Kyos Veeble, Autosavant.

P S Part of the fun of Dark Heresy is deciding which Skills to develop and learn during the career of your character. This chapter contains all the detailed information you might need to help you use Skills to their full effect. See **Chapter VII: Playing the Game** on **[page](#page-182-0) [182](#page-182-0)**, for details on Skill Tests, Characteristics and how they are made.

## GAINING SKILLS
*"Foolish are those who fear nothing, yet claim to know everything."*
— *Lexiconum Moralis.*

When you create your character you begin with a list of starting Skills based on your home world, as well as a selection of Skills from your Career Path. These Skills represent what you have learned in your life up to the point where you chose to serve the Inquisition. Over time, you will gain additional Experience, which you can spend to acquire new Skills or improve existing ones.

## **SKILL MASTERY**

Sometimes you will have the opportunity to acquire the same Skill more than once. Each time you acquire a Skill a second or subsequent time, you gain Skill Mastery with it. Skill Mastery adds a +10 bonus to all Skill Tests made with this Skill. You can acquire the same Skill no more than three times (granting a maximum Skill Mastery of +20). This represents additional training and experience with the Skill you have gained during your career.

### **Example**

*Mordechai has the Interrogation skill. At a later date his Arbitrator Career Path gives him the opportunity to acquire the Skill again. As he already has the Skill, he gains Skill Mastery, granting him a +10 bonus to any Skill Tests made with Interrogation.*

## BASIC & ADVANCED SKILLS

*"Even the lowest trade is blessed, if it is done in the Emperor's name."*

— Administratum Motto.

Skills are divided into two categories: Basic and Advanced. This distinction defines which Skills you can use without special training and which Skills you can't.

### **BASIC SKILLS**

Basic Skills are those common to citizens throughout the Imperium, and simply growing up on a world under Imperial rule exposes characters to the rudiments of the Skill. As a result, you can make Skill Tests using Basic Skills even if you don't have the Skill in question. Since you are relying on natural aptitude rather than any sort of formal training, you make the test at half (round down) your Characteristic.

### **ADVANCED SKILLS**

Advanced Skills are those that require training and experience in order to master and understand. If you do not have an Advanced Skill, you cannot attempt it. No matter how intelligent you are, for instance, you will not be able to access an encrypted cogitator engine without some formal training.

## **SKILL DESCRIPTORS**

Some Skills are flagged with special descriptors such as combat, crafting, interaction, investigation, movement or operator. These Skills use special rules that are described in **Chapter VII: Playing the Game** and **Chapter VIII: The Game Master.** In summary, Crafting skills are those used to create items from scratch and spare parts. Interaction skills are those used when interacting with NPCs. Investigation skills are those used to ferret out additional information about a subject. Movement skills offer alternative means to get around your environment. And finally, Operator skills allow you to operate a vehicle.

### **Crafting Skills**

Certain Skills enable you to create items from parts and materials. To do so, you must have the materials, as determined by the GM, available. You then test the appropriate Skill (e.g. Chem-Use or Trade (any)) applying any bonuses or penalties due to the quality of materials, environmental factors and anything else as determined by the GM. On a success, you generate the item. Note that the quality/finish/usefulness of the item improves for each degree of success gained. Failing by three degrees indicates you have ruined some of the materials. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that you have completely ruined all of the Skill Groups materials and must start over from scratch. Note that the time it takes to create the item is determined by the GM.

### **Interaction Skills**

The difficulty of the Skill Test depends on the target's disposition, which is determined by the GM. See **Chapter VIII: The Game Master** for guidelines. Note that this is a guide, and your GM may modify the difficulties based on the circumstances of the encounter.

# **SKILL GROUPS**

Some of the listed Skills are actually groups of related abilities. Skill groups are listed under one entry for the sake of ease, but each one is a separate ability that must be acquired individually. For example: Scholastic Lore (Imperial Law) and Scholastic Lore (Imperial History) are different Skills. A character with Scholastic Lore (Imperial History) cannot make Scholastic Lore (Imperial Law) Tests and vice versa.

# SKILL DESCRIPTIONS

*"Educate men without faith and you make them nothing more than clever devils."* — Kross Vorgt, Drill Abbot.

Descriptions of both Basic and Advanced Skills follow, presented in alphabetical order.

## **Acrobatics (Advanced, Movement) Agility**

The Acrobatics skill encompasses a variety of movement techniques unavailable to less flexible Acolytes. From performing somersaults to tumbling, from flipping through the air to daring leaps and jumps, this Skill expands your movement options.

Use this Skill to perform some spectacular feat of derring-do. The Difficulty depends on the desired action. The more complicated the manoeuvre, such as somersaulting over a group of enraged cultists to grab the skids of a Vulture as it takes off, the harder the difficulty. The more degrees of success you attain, the more impressive the result.

There are two special rules associated with this Skill:

**Disengage:** You may make an Acrobatics Test when attempting a Disengage Action to reduce it to a Half Action.

**Jumping & Leaping:** You may substitute an Acrobatics Test for an Agility Test when Jumping or Strength Tests when Leaping.

An Acrobatics Test is typically a Full Action.

## **Awareness (Basic) Perception**

The Awareness skill reflects your ability to perceive hidden dangers and to notice small details about your physical surroundings. You use the Awareness skill to notice ambushes, spot traps and discern other threats to you and your allies. Awareness is not tied to any one sense; it encompasses them all.

When using Awareness to detect a hidden enemy, the Test is always Opposed. Otherwise, the thing you are trying to detect applies a Difficulty based on how cunningly concealed it is.

An Awareness Test is usually a Free Action made in reaction to something.

## **Barter (Basic) Fellowship**

You can use the Barter skill to negotiate deals and get better prices on goods and services. When dealing with day-to-day affairs, like haggling in a bazaar over the price of a fine set of tarot cards, or trading lho-sticks for food in an arbitrator cell block, a single Test is sufficient. However, for important deals, such as those entailing risk to one side, carried out under dangerous circumstances or involving a large amount of Thrones (negotiating the bounty on the head of a dangerous alien, for instance), the GM may call for an Opposed Test, with both sides using their Barter skill. As a rough guide, a success will reduce the price of an item by 10%, with each additional success reducing it by a further 5%.

A typical Barter Test takes about five minutes, but delicate dealings and intricate negotiations may require more time, as decided by the GM.

## **Blather (Advanced, Interaction) Fellowship**

When you make a Blather Test, you stall for time by running off at the mouth, spewing a stream of words and nonsense in an attempt to confuse and distract others. A Blather Test is always Opposed by your target's Willpower (or Scrutiny). If you succeed and the target fails, the target is distracted by you and can do nothing for one Round, staring dumbfounded and wondering if you are drunk, crazy or both. For every degree of success, you dumbfound the target for an additional Round.

If your target succeeds and you fail, or if you both fail, your attempt at verbal acrobatics fails and the target may act normally. In the case where you both succeed, the character that had the most degrees of success determines the outcome.

You can also use Blather against multiple opponents. For similar opponents—those that have the same general Characteristics—make a Blather Test as normal, but the GM rolls just one Willpower Test. If you win the Opposed Test, you affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

NPCs, while confused by your banter, are unaffected by your words if they are in obvious danger or if it is clear there are preparations being made to harm them. The target must understand the language you are speaking or the Test automatically fails—you cannot, for instance, use this Skill against animals.

A Blather Test is a Full Action.

## **Carouse (Basic) Toughness**

Whether consuming the finest amasec brandy or the cheapest stomach-stripping hive juices, you use the Carouse skill to resist the effects of alcohol and narcotics. Experienced carousers can build up quite a tolerance and remain clear-headed and lucid while those around them succumb to the effects of their amusements. Use this Skill whenever you must resist the effects of alcohol or similar intoxicants.

Each time you take a drink or some other form of intoxicant, make a Carouse Test. Failure indicates you have gained a level of Fatigue. Should you pass out as a result, you become unconscious for a number of hours equal to 1d10 minus your Toughness Bonus (minimum one hour). Your GM may incur further Test penalties as a result of intoxicant use as they see fit.

A Carouse Test is a Free Action. You use this Skill whenever you imbibe.

## **Charm (Basic, Interaction) Fellowship**

The Charm skill is used to befriend others. You make Charm Tests whenever you want to change the minds of individuals or small groups, to beg, or seduce. You need not make a Charm

Test every time you talk to an NPC; only when you want to change their opinions of you or convince them to do something for you, such as giving you a tip, a dance or a kiss.

A Charm Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus and your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say.

A Charm Test typically takes one minute.

## **Chem-Use (Advanced, Crafting, Investigation) Intelligence**

You can use the Chem-Use skill to handle and prepare chemicals safely, especially toxins, poisons and drugs. Chem-Use covers the use and manufacture of toxins and it can also be used to identify a variety of chemicals (Investigation use).

To prepare or apply a chemical, you must succeed at a Chem-Use Test, with modifiers determined by the GM. On a failed test the chemical is wasted. If you fail by five or more degrees, you accidentally poison yourself or overdose. See **Chapter V: armory** for more information on chemicals and their effects.

When using a toxin wand or administering an antidote, the time taken to do so is halved with a successful Chem-Use Test.

A Chem-Use Test to administer a chemical is a Full Action.

Using Chem-Use to manufacture toxins utilises the rules for Crafting items as described on **[page 96](#page-96-0)**.

## **Ciphers (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, War Cant, Secret Society, Occult and Underworld.

The Ciphers skill reflects an understanding of shorthand codes employed by certain groups to confer basic ideas, warnings, and information about a given area. This can be in the form of hand signals or as physical symbols inscribed on a surface, usually in a subtle place. Ciphers are not very sophisticated, mostly used to warn of danger, mark a target or indicate protection. Skill Tests are not required to read basic messages but may be necessary to decipher complicated communications or worn or damaged signs.

**Acolyte:** Used to communicate a private and prearranged code between given members of an Acolyte's cell. Note that this code is unique to each cell of Acolytes.

**War Cant**: Used to convey instructions to troops by means of hand signals, body language or musical code.

**Secret Society:** Used by members of a given secret society or cult to identify one another and convey simple messages. Note that this code is unique to each secret society.

**Occult:** Mystical gestures used to focus the mind during incantation, to identify fellow sorcerers and to supplicate or castigate Daemons.

**Underworld:** Convoluted systems of hand gestures, clothing styles, signs and other such chicanery used by criminal fraternities to communicate key information.

A Ciphers Test usually takes a Full Action to give or inscribe the sign, and a Free Action to comprehend it.

## **Climb (Basic, Movement) Strength**

Use the Climb skill to ascend or descend surfaces described as sheer. Sheer surfaces are walls without handholds, overhangs and other poor climbing conditions. Generally, a successful Test allows you to ascend or descend at half of your Half Move rate. Note that poor climbing conditions may impose a penalty to the Test. See Climbing in **Chapter VII: Playing the Game** for more details.

A Climb Test is a Half Action.

## **Command (Basic) Fellowship**

Command is used to make subordinates follow your orders. You may only use this Skill on those who are under your authority. A successful Command Test indicates that those whom you direct follow your instructions. On a failed Test, they either misinterpret the command or do nothing at all, or if you fail by five or more degrees, contradict your orders entirely.

A Command Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus and your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say.

A Command Test is a Half Action for simple commands and a Full Action for more involved instructions.

## **Common Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Adeptus Arbites, Machine Cult, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Creed, Imperial Guard, Imperium, Tech, Underworld, War. Other Common Lores may be available at the GM's discretion.

Use the Common Lore skill to recall the habits, institutions, traditions, public figures and superstitions of a particular world, cultural group, organisation or race. This Skill does not represent scholarly learning (that is Scholastic Lore), nor obscure forbidden knowledge (that is Forbidden Lore), but rather the basics you learn by growing up or travelling extensively through a region.

When making a Common Lore Test, you recall basic information about the subject. Each degree of success reveals a bit more information as determined by the GM.

**Adeptus Arbites:** Knowledge of the various arms and sub-sects of the Arbites, including such things as their ranking structure and common procedures.

**Machine Cult:** A general understanding of the symbols and practices of the Mechanicus, as well as such things as formal greetings and identifying rankings.

**Administratum:** Broad knowledge of the inner workings, rules and regulations of the Administratum.

**Ecclesiarchy:** Understanding of the hierarchy of the Cult of the Emperor, its rankings, greetings and general practices.

**Imperial Creed:** Knowledge of the rites and practices of the Imperial Cult, the most common observances to the Emperor and the most well-known saints.

**Imperial Guard:** Basic information about the ranking systems, logistics and structure of the Imperial Guard as well as such things as their common practices, both tactical and strategic.

**Imperium:** Knowledge of the sectors, segmentums and most wellknown worlds of the Imperium.

**Tech:** An understanding of simple litanies and rituals to sooth and appease machine spirits.

**Underworld:** Understanding of organised crime and sedition within the Imperium.

**War:** Knowledge of great battles, notable (and notorious) commanders and heroes, as well as famous stratagems.

Using Common Lore takes no time at all. You either know something or you do not.

## **Concealment (Basic) Agility**

Concealment is used whenever you want to hide from sight. To use this Skill, there must be appropriate terrain (trees, walls, buildings or some other obstacle) or some concealing effect like fog or darkness. Otherwise, the test automatically fails. Concealment is always an Opposed Test, in which you pit your Concealment Test against your opponent's Awareness Test (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill). You need not Test Concealment when you hide, only when someone is looking for you. If you succeed, you remain unseen.

If you remain perfectly still, you gain a +10 bonus to your Test.

A Concealment Test is usually a Half Action.

## **Contortionist (Basic, Movement) Agility**

The Contortionist skill is used to wriggle free from bonds, squeeze through a narrow opening, or slip out of chains.

## **Escape Bonds**

Whenever you attempt to slip free from any kind of bonds, you make a Contortionist Test. The Difficulty depends on the Intelligence of the person who secured you in the first place. If their Intelligence exceeds your Agility Characteristic, the Test is Hard (–20). Other factors may worsen or diminish the Difficulty, such as whether simple manacles or complicated arbitrator restraint cuffs were used, or whether you were hastily secured or your captor took his time to ensure that you could not escape.

## **Escape Grapple**

When you have been Grappled in combat, you may use the Contortionist skill to escape. Make a Contortionist Test opposed by the grappler's Strength Test. If you win you break free, otherwise you remain Grappled.

## **Squeeze through a Tight Space**

You can make a Contortionist Test to squeeze through a tight space, such as between the bars of your jail cell, past a cave-in blocking your path or through the air vents of a space hulk. The difficulty of the Test is set according to how tight the space is. The GM is well within his rights to rule that a space is simply too narrow to squeeze through, and common sense applies as always. Success allows you to squeeze through unhindered, whereas failure means that the opening is too narrow after all. If you fail by five or more degrees, you become stuck until you can pass a subsequent Contortionist Test or until someone helps you out of your predicament by dragging you out, greasing the passage and so on.

Most Contortionist Tests take one minute, with each degree of success reducing this time by ten seconds. Escaping a Grapple is a Full Action attempted during combat.

## **Deceive (Basic, Interaction) Fellowship**

The Deceive skill is used to lie and con others. You make Deceive Tests whenever you would convince others of something that is not necessarily true, want to dupe them or otherwise swindle and mislead them. You need not make a Deceive Test every time you lie to an NPC; only when you want to change their opinions of you or convince them of something.

A Deceive Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus and your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say. Deceive is typically opposed by Scrutiny.

A Deceive Test typically takes one minute.

## **Demolition (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

You use the Demolition skill to blow things up without blowing yourself up at the same time! It is used to plant explosive devices and defuse bombs, as well as for the safe handling and manufacture of explosives. Demolition involves explosive devices that are planted or set, rather than those that are simply lobbed at the enemy.

### **Manufacture Explosives**

Given enough time and resources you may use the Demolition skill to make an explosive device from scratch, or rig an otherwise normal device to explode. The Difficulty of the Test varies according to what ingredients you have available and how long you have to manufacture it. Rigging a frag grenade to explode when primed is a simple matter, but building a melta bomb from scratch is considerably harder. Generally, manufacturing explosives uses the rules for Crafting items described on **[page 96](#page-96-0)**.

### **Planting Explosives**

Explosive devices such as demolition charges, melta bombs and krak grenades are far more effective when planted on a target. To plant an explosive make a Demolition Test. Success indicates that you have successfully planted the explosive, with a trigger mechanism and condition of your choice. Possible triggers include timers, fuses, proximity sensors or remote controls. Failure indicates that you believe the explosives to be planted properly, but when triggered they fail to go off. If you fail by five or more degrees, you accidentally set the explosives off yourself ! Boom!

You may voluntarily make the Test more difficult, for example increasing the time to plant a bomb in a more vulnerable location. By doing so, the Damage dealt is increased by +2 for each level of Difficulty increased or additional minute spent setting the explosive.

For every degree of success on the Demolition Test, the explosive is harder to detect and to defuse. Note the number of degrees of success down when you plant an explosive—it will be used in any Opposed Demolition Tests made to defuse or discover the bomb.

### **Defusing a Bomb**

A character can also use the Demolition skill to defuse a bomb. To defuse a bomb before it explodes requires you to make an Opposed Demolition Test against the Demolition Test of the character who set the bomb in the first place. Success means that the bomb has been defused in time. Failure means that you have not disarmed the bomb yet, although in all but a catastrophic failure you can try again next Round, if you still have the time. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that you have accidentally set the bomb off by mistake!

A Demolition Test to plant or defuse an explosive is usually a Full Action. A test made to manufacture an explosive takes at least one minute, and usually considerably longer, depending on the complexity of the device.

## **Disguise (Basic) Fellowship**

The Disguise skill is used to mask your true appearance. Appropriate clothing, props, make-up and prosthetics are often key to a successful disguise, as are more radical accoutrements such as plastic surgery, bionic implants or polymorphine. It is also possible to masquerade as a member of the opposite sex, a different race or a specific person, though these are more difficult to pull off. Often, Disguise is an Opposed Skill Test against your foes' Scrutiny.

The time it takes to create a disguise varies greatly depending on its complexity, but it usually requires a minimum of one minute to don a simple disguise.

## **Dodge (Basic, Combat) Agility**

You may use the Dodge skill once per Round to negate a successful hand-tohand or ranged attack. On a successful Test, the attack deals no Damage. See **Chapter VII: Playing the Game** for more information on Dodge.

A Dodge Test is a Reaction.

## **Drive (Advanced, Operator) Agility**

**Skill Group:** Ground Vehicle, Hover Vehicle, Walker

The Drive skill is used to control autos, trucks, landspeeders and other land-based or hover vehicles. Driving under normal conditions does not require a Test. However, Tests may be called for when navigating treacherous terrain, going at excessive speed or attempting dangerous manoeuvres. Opposed Drive Tests are made between pursuers and pursued during a chase.

A Drive Test is typically a Half Action, but certain manoeuvres may require more or less time.

## **Vehicles in the Imperium**

The Imperium is home to a dizzying array of vehicles, from rickety handcarts to mighty Emperor class battleships. Presented here are a few examples of the kinds of vehicles that Acolytes can expect to come across in Dark Heresy.

### **Riding Beasts**

Across the galaxy there are innumerable creatures trained as riding beasts for mankind. The most common is the horse, which spread across the stars with mankind. Many planets are heavily dependent on such beasts, especially feral planets or low-tech agri-worlds.

### **Bikes**

Bikes are common throughout the Imperium, ranging from a variety of civilian models to heavily armed and armored vehicles designed for combat. Each can carry one driver and equipment, and a further passenger if room permits on the seat.

### **Guncutters**

Guncutters are light aircraft, often capable of reaching low orbit. They are combat-ready and usually covered with heavy weaponry. As such, they immediately project an intimidating appearance, often useful for dangerous negotiations. Most can only carry a small crew and limited passengers.

### **Chimera**

The Chimera armored Personnel Carrier is a staple transport and light support vehicle for military and paramilitary organisations throughout the Imperium. It has good armor, can mount a range of heavy weapons and has the capacity to carry up to twelve passengers along with a crew of three.

### **Aquila Lander**

The Aquila Lander is commonly used by the Imperial Navy to carry dignitaries, officials and other high-ranking individuals to and from planetside to other orbiting vessels. The vehicle name comes from the distinctive double-headed "aquila" symbol of the Imperium embossed into its hull and wings. It has no interplanetary capability, but is an excellent light shuttle designed with style and comfort in mind for an official and his retinue, easily carrying seven plus a crew of one pilot.

## **Evaluate (Basic, Investigation) Intelligence**

You can use Evaluate to determine the approximate value of everyday objects, as well as valuables such as archeotech and other objects d'art. A successful Test reveals the item's market price and possibly a little bit about the item itself. Since a failed Test may result in the miscalculation of an item's true value, it is recommended that the GM rolls Evaluate Tests in secret and tells the player what his character believes to be true.

Evaluating an item usually takes at least one minute, although the GM may decide to give a bonus if the character takes more time or a penalty if he simply gives it a quick once over.

## **Forbidden Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** The Black Library, Cults, Daemonology, Heresy, Inquisition, Archeotech, Mutants, Ordos, Adeptus Mechanicus, Psykers, Warp and Xenos.

Forbidden Lore skills represent dangerous and often heretical knowledge gleaned from the myriad of unconventional sources an Acolyte often finds in his possession. This Skill represents a combination of scholarly learning and knowledge gained through practical experience. Simply possessing the Forbidden Lore skill is often sufficient to warrant termination at the hands of the Inquisition, and a character must tread carefully when revealing such knowledge.

When making a Forbidden Lore Test, you recall basic information about the subject. Each degree of success reveals a bit more information as determined by the GM.

A character that learns the Forbidden Lore skill in play, or who uses it to gain some insight into the mysteries of the galaxy, may also gain a number of Corruption or Insanity Points, depending on the danger the knowledge represents, at the GM's discretion.

**The Black Library:** Secret knowledge of the Black Library, its forbidden contents, strange industries and the unspeakable pale, hairless things that toil within its walls.

**Cults:** Knowledge of the most notorious Imperial Cults and some of their sub-sects and splinter cabals.

**Daemonology:** Terrible comprehension of some of the recorded warp entities and their various manifestations.

**Heresy:** Unpleasant appreciation for those acts and practices deemed heretical by the Imperium.

**Inquisition:** A general understanding (often based on hearsay and rumour) of that most terrible and secret of organisations known as the Inquisition.

**Archeotech:** Knowledge of the great tech devices of ancient times and clues to their function and purpose.

**Mutants:** Covering the study of both stable and unstable mutations and some of their more unfortunate results.

**Ordos:** Either Malleus, Hereticus or Xenos and granting some slightly more specialised knowledge of that particular ordo's practices.

**Adeptus Mechanicus:** An understanding of the followers of the Machine God, including such things as their observances, common beliefs and core philosophies.

**Psykers:** Skill in identifying the signs of psykers as well as the results of their powers and the extent of their capabilities.

**Warp:** An understanding of the ways of the warp, especially its interaction with realspace and how its tides and eddies can affect travel between the stars.

**Xenos:** Knowledge of the most commonly encountered species of aliens within the Imperium.

Using Forbidden Lore takes no time at all. You either know something or you do not, although the consequences for knowing such things can last a lifetime….

# **Gamble (Basic) Intelligence**

The Gamble skill is used to participate in games of chance, such as card games or crude (and often violent) dice games popular amongst the lower classes. Each participant in a game wagers the same amount and makes an Opposed Gamble Test. The player with the most degrees of success (or fewest degrees of failure) wins the pot. You may, at your option, choose to throw the game, in which case you lose automatically.

You may also opt to use Sleight of Hand instead of Gamble to hide cards up your sleeve or palm dice. Success gives you a +20 bonus to your Gamble Test. However, failing by five or more degrees indicates that your ruse is revealed with predictably unpleasant consequences.

Making a Gamble Test can represent anything from controlling a single hand of cards to an entire day spent gaming.

# **Inquiry (Basic, Investigation) Fellowship**

The Inquiry skill is your ability to pick up rumours, secrets and guarded information by asking questions, buying drinks and generally watching and listening for anything of interest that might bubble up. Inquiry can be used in one of two ways. The first and most common way is to pick up general information about local developments. A successful Test reveals basic information, with additional and higher-quality intelligence with each degree of success.

Inquiry can also be used as an Investigation skill, wherein you might be chasing after a particular fact or secret. For more information on investigation, see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game.**

Making an Inquiry Test usually represents an hour or so of activity, but may represent a much longer or shorter period as circumstances dictate.

# **Interrogation (Advanced, Investigation) Willpower**

The key tool in an Inquisitor's arsenal is interrogation—the ability to extract quality information from an unwilling subject. There is a fine line between interrogation and crude torture. In the case of the latter, subjects tend to reveal whatever their tormenter wishes to hear, but in the case of the former, a skilled interrogator can tease out the darkest secrets by utilising a variety of devices, serums and techniques.

Gear, environmental conditions and circumstances can all apply additional modifiers at the GM's discretion. Make an Opposed Test, pitting your Interrogation skill against your opponent's Willpower. If you beat your opponent, you get one answer plus one other answer for each degree of success. If your opponent wins the Opposed Test, you get nothing of worth. On a serious failure, you botch the procedure and inflict 1d10 plus your Willpower Bonus in Damage. If you fail by five or more degrees, you deal Damage as before but your subject gains a +30 bonus to Willpower Tests made to resist Interrogation.

Each Interrogation Test inflicts one level of Fatigue on the target. An Interrogation Test consumes 1d5 hours of time.

# **Intimidate (Basic, Interaction) Strength**

You make Intimidate Tests whenever you want to coerce or frighten individuals or a small group. You need not make an Intimidate Test every time you make a threat. Usually Intimidate is backed up by Strength, but more subtle threats such as blackmail may use Intelligence or Fellowship at the GM's option. The more degrees of success, the more frightened your opponent becomes.

An Intimidate Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Strength Bonus, Intelligence Bonus, or Fellowship Bonus, depending on the Characteristics you are using for your Test. In addition, your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say.

An Intimidate Test is a Full Action.

# **Invocation (Advanced) Willpower**

An Invocation Test allows you to boost your Power Roll when using Psychic Powers by an amount equal to your Willpower Bonus. An Invocation Test is a Full Action. During this time, you clear your mind through various means, such as muttering mantras, meditating, fingering psychic-foci and so on. A successful Test indicates that your mind is well prepared to touch the warp. On the next Round, you may add your Willpower Bonus in addition to any other bonus you add to your Power Roll.

### **Example**

*Doc Skul decides to visit the Inflict Pain Minor Psychic Power on his hated rival, Slippery Zim. He spends a full Turn shaking his bone rattle and muttering spitefully under his breath as part of his Invocation Test. He rolls to see if these preparations will help him Focus Power. He rolls 15—a success! On the following Round, he attempts to manifest Inflict Pain. He gets 4 on his Power Roll and adds his Willpower Bonus of 3 to this as normal. Because of his successful Invocation, he may now add an additional 3 points to this roll. In total, Doc Skul has made a Power Roll of 10 (4+3+3=10). His Focus Power Action succeeds, and Slippery Zim doubles over in pain!*

Failure on an Invocation Test indicates that you are not composed enough to gain any benefits from your preparations. If you make a successful Invocation Test and then do not take the Focus Power Action on the following Turn, there are no side effects (aside from you possibly looking a little foolish).

# **Lip Reading (Advanced) Perception**

Use the Lip Reading skill to "listen in" on conversations that take place out of earshot. To use this Skill, you must have an unobstructed view of the speaker's mouth and you must also be able to understand the language spoken. Distance is the biggest factor. The further away the subject is, the harder the Test. The base Difficulty is Challenging (+0), but it worsens by one step for every ten metres of distance. Note that equipment that magnifies vision can be used to offset this penalty and even provide bonuses.

A successful Test reveals the general gist of the conversation, such as the person is talking about the weather, new tariffs at the space dock, and so on. Each degree of success reveals more specific details.

A Lip Reading Test is a Full Action, though it lasts as long as the target speaks.

# **Literacy (Advanced) Intelligence**

The Literacy skill enables you to read any language you can speak. You normally do not need to Test Literacy for everyday instances of reading or writing, but the GM may call for a Literacy Test when you attempt to read a challenging dialect, poor penmanship, decipher obscure phraseology, archaic usage or unusual idioms.

To read one page of text approximately 750 words—a Literacy Test takes about a minute.

# **Logic (Basic, Investigation) Intelligence**

Logic represents your proficiency at mathematics and your ability at problem solving. Logic Tests might be made to decipher a code or to solve a particularly troublesome equation. Logic is also used by Tech-Priests to incant mathematical rituals on machinery. Note that Logic is a purely theoretical Skill—Tech-Use is its practical counterpart.

A Logic Test usually takes one minute of pondering and thinking, although especially difficult problems might require much longer.

# **Medicae (Advanced) Intelligence**

The Medicae skill is used to treat and repair injuries by closing wounds and restoring the balance of the body's humors. There are two general methods for using Medicae: First Aid and Extended Care. You can use the former to attend fallen or injured comrades, while the latter serves to hasten the removal of damage.

### **First Aid**

Using the Medicae skill to perform First Aid offers a quick fix for injured or dying characters. A successful Medicae Test removes Damage equal to your Intelligence Bonus to Lightly Wounded characters, 1 Damage from Heavily Wounded characters and 1 point of Critical Damage from Critically Wounded characters. On a failure, the patient is not adversely affected and simply removes Damage at the natural healing rate. However, a failure by three or more degrees indicates that Lightly or Heavily Wounded take a point of Damage, whilst a character on 0 Wounds must make a Toughness Test or die.

First Aid may only be applied to each Wound once and is a Full Action by you and your patient.

### **Extended Care**

Extended Care speeds the healing process. You can attend a number of patients equal to your Intelligence Bonus. Each patient above this number imposes a cumulative –10 penalty to your Medicae Tests to provide extended care. For Lightly Wounded patients make one Test at the end of each day. For Heavily or Critically Wounded patients, Test once at the end of each week. On a success, your patient removes twice the normal Damage (removing Critical Damage first then normal Damage), plus 1 Damage for each degree of success. On a failure, your patients are not adversely affected, removing Damage at the normal rates. A failure by three or more degrees indicates that all Lightly Wounded or Heavily Wounded characters take 1 Damage—use Sudden Death to resolve Critical Damage. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that all patients take 1d10 Damage—again, use Sudden Death to resolve Critical Damage.

For more information on Healing, see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**.

**Special:** The Master Churgeon talent expands your options with the Medicae skill, see **[page 118](#page-118-0)**.

# **Navigation (Advanced) Intelligence**

### **Skill Group:** Surface, Stellar.

You employ the Navigation skill whenever you want to use maps, technical readouts, innate knowledge and landmarks to chart a proper course and avoid becoming lost. A successful Navigation Test can also estimate travel times based on geography, cosmography, time of year, weather and so on. Under normal circumstances, a single successful Test each day is sufficient to keep you on track, though the GM may call for additional Tests if there are unusual conditions, such as fluctuating landmasses, swirling eddies of plasma or violent storms.

**Surface Navigation** is used to navigate across a planet's surface, using logi-compasses, map readouts and geographical knowledge.

**Stellar Navigation** is used to navigate in space between planets, using star charts and carto mantic rituals.

A Navigation Test usually represents several hours of charting courses, consulting maps and making heading corrections, but it may take one minute or less if its purpose is just to find out where you are.

# **Performer (Advanced) Fellowship**

**Skill Group:** Dancer, Musician, Singer, Storyteller. Others may be available with the GM's discretion.

Use the Performer skill to entertain and enthrall crowds of spectators. The Performer skill may be used to earn an income, much as with Trade. In addition, the Performer skill may be substituted for certain Skills under specific circumstances.

**Charming Performance:** You may make a Difficult (–10) Performer (Storyteller) or Performer (Singer) Test instead of Charm, to win round your audience, causing them to respond more favourably to you.

**Enthralling Performance:** You may make a Difficult (–10) Performer (Musician) or Performer (Singer) Test instead of Blather, utterly enthralling and distracting your audience for a moment. This use is subject to the normal rules governing the Blather skill.

A Performer Test can take a variable amount of time, and can represent anything from a short poem or song to an elaborate and long-winded opera.

# **Pilot (Advanced, Operator) Agility**

**Skill Group:** Civilian Craft, Military Craft, Spacecraft.

The Pilot skill is used to fly anything from small atmospheric craft such as ornithopters and landers, all the way up to spaceship-sized vessels. Piloting a ship under normal conditions does not require a Test. However, Tests may be called for when flying in conditions such as storms, going at excessive speed or attempting dangerous manoeuvres.

When chasing another vehicle, you and your opponent make Opposed Pilot Tests.

A Pilot Test is typically a Half Action, but certain manoeuvres may require more or less time.

# **Psyniscience (Advanced) Perception**

You can use the Psyniscience skill to become attuned with the ebb and flow of the warp and the immaterium. The most common application of this Skill is to detect the presence or absence of Daemons or other psykers. To do so, make a Psyniscience Test. On a success, you extend your senses out to a number of metres equal to your Perception Bonus plus 1d10. Each degree of success allows you to add 1d10+PB metres to your roll.

You can also Test to detect unusual psychic phenomena, areas where realspace has been "disrupted", areas where the immaterium seems to be blocked (or shielded against), and so on. The GM may wish to make the Test in secret depending on just what it is that the psyker may detect.

The results of any Psyniscience Test are summarised on the following chart:

## **Degrees of Success Result** Standard Awareness that success the immaterium is being disrupted. One General location from where the phenomena emanates. Two+ Exact location of the individual

Using Psyniscience is a Full Action.

# **Scholastic Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Archaic, Astromancy, Beasts, Bureaucracy, Chymistry, Cryptology, Heraldry, Imperial Creed, Judgement, Legend, Numerology, Occult, Philosophy, Tactica Imperialis.

The Scholastic Lore skill grants you knowledge of a particular scholarly subject. A successful Test enables you to recall pertinent facts and—if you have access to the proper facilities or resources—to do research. Scholastic Lore represents a depth of learning far beyond Common Lore and it requires extensive study.

You make Scholastic Lore Tests to identify an object, creature or place that falls under your particular area of expertise. A successful Test about a subject related to your speciality reveals the basic information. Each degree of success reveals more information as follows:

|                    |                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Degrees of Success | Result                                                                                          |
| Standard           | Reveals basic information                                                                       |
| success            | known to people of your training.                                                               |
| One                | Reveals uncommonly known information,even among your peers.                                     |
| Two                | Reveals obscure information about the subject. Such information is known to but a few scholars. |
| Three+             | Reveals extremely obscure information, known only to a handful of experts.                      |

In some areas, Scholastic Lore overlaps with Common Lore and Forbidden Lore, but almost always represents a far greater—and more academic—level of study. A character with Common Lore (Imperial Creed) might understand the day-to-day rituals and prayers gained from living under the creed, whereas a character with Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) might be able to explain why such rituals exist and how they have changed over the millennia.

To recall a fact or titbit about the subject, a Scholastic Lore Test takes no time at all. You either know the fact or not. Researching, assuming you are in the proper environment to do so, takes far longer. You may make one Academic Lore Test every 1d10 hours. See **Chapter VII: Playing the Game** for details.

**Archaic:** An understanding of the murky past of the Imperium and how the long millennia have changed the face of mankind.

**Astromancy:** A knowledge of stars, heavenly bodies and the nature of worlds, as well as theoretical understanding of how to use telescopes, astrolabes and so on.

**Beasts:** An understanding of the classification of animals and familiarity with the properties of many types of semi-sentient creatures.

**Bureaucracy:** An understanding of how to deal with governments, particularly the Administratum, and their many and varied departments, forms and policies.

**Chymistry:** A knowledge of chemicals, their alchemical applications and their use throughout the Imperium.

**Cryptology:** An understanding of codes, ciphers, secret languages and numerical keys. This may be used to either crack a code, or create one.

**Heraldry:** A grasp of the principles of heraldry, as well as a knowledge of the most common liveries, seals and heraldic devices used in the Imperium.

**Imperial Creed**: An understanding of the rituals of the Ecclesiarchy, the construction of their temples and the finer points of liturgy. May be used to conduct rituals for others.

**Judgement:** Knowledge of the proper punishments for the myriad of crimes and heresies punishable by Imperial law.

**Legend:** A knowledge of the great histories of old, such as the terrible Horus Heresy and the Dark Age of Technology.

**Numerology:** An understanding of the mysterious properties of numbers, from Catastrophe theory to the Sadleirian litany.

**Occult:** An understanding of occult ritual, theories and superstitions, as well as the better known mystical uses of occult items.

**Philosophy:** A knowledge of the theories of thought, belief and criticism. May be used for debate and for creating philosophical works.

**Tactica Imperialis:** A grounding in the Tactica Imperialis, as well as other theories of war, troop deployment and battle techniques. May be used to plan a battle or deduce the likely flow of war.

# **Scrutiny (Basic) Perception**

Use the Scrutiny skill to make assessments about people you encounter, to determine if someone is lying to you, to sense ulterior motives and generally appraise the worth of another being. When trying to perceive a falsehood, or some other form of deception, you make an Opposed Test, pitting your Scrutiny against the target's Deceive. If you beat your opponent by achieving more degrees of success, you get a hunch that something is not right.

Note that Scrutiny does not confer telepathy and cannot be used to reveal all the secrets about a target. Rather, this Skill serves to counteract attempts to manipulate you through Interaction skills such as Charm, Deceive and Intimidate.

# **Search (Basic) Perception**

Use the Search skill whenever you want to examine an area for concealed objects, clues and anything else that might be hidden. Search differs from Awareness in that you Test Awareness passively, Testing whenever some hidden danger might appear or to notice a small detail as you move past it. Search, on the other hand, represents an active effort to check an area.

A single Search Test is sufficient to cover a small room or area. When an object or individual is deliberately hidden, a Search Test is resolved as an Opposed Test, pitting your Search Test against your target's Concealment Test.

A Search Test takes a minimum of five minutes, dependent on the area being examined.

# **Secret Tongue (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Gutter, Military, Tech. Other secret tongues may be available at the GM's discretion.

Secret Tongue is used to speak and comprehend a particularly obscure and arcane language known to only those of a specific profession, organisation or class. Secret tongues are more like codes than real languages. By the use of signifiers, body language and code words, users can speak in one tongue but use a secret language to impart deeper meaning or to relay a lot of information quickly. Under normal circumstances, Skill Tests are unnecessary if all speakers know the secret language. They may be required in adverse conditions such as communicating in a noisy venue, or during the chaos of battle. Groups of Acolytes may develop their own coded language, unique to their cell. This is represented by the Secret Tongue (Acolyte) skill.

**Acolyte:** A pre-arranged series of code phrases and inflections intelligible only to a fellow cell member. Note that each cell of Acolytes has a unique version of this language.

**Administratum:** A collection of acronyms, jargon and procedural formalities used by the Administratum. Note that this is an exceedingly longwinded language.

**Ecclesiarchy:** An allegorical language of devotion and politics, full of strange metaphors and specialised High Gothic.

**Gutter:** A pidgin version of Low Gothic spoken by the lowest levels of Imperial society, incorporating a mishmash of colourful slang terms.

**Military:** A selection of coded phrases, jargon, references to ancient battles and a surprising number of terms for death.

**Tech:** The Lingua Technis of the Adeptus Mechanicus, comprising of jargon, binary and in some cases low or high frequency sound waves.

A Secret Tongue Test is usually a Free Action.

# **Security (Advanced) Agility**

You can use the Security skill to bypass locks and other security systems. The Difficulty of the Test depends on the quality of the defence. Generally one Test is sufficient, but more complicated systems may require additional Tests or degrees of success.

A Security Test takes one minute, with each degree of success reducing this time by ten seconds.

# **Shadowing (Advanced) Agility**

The Shadowing skill allows you to follow another creature or vehicle without being seen. Shadowing differs from Concealment in that you are moving while masking your presence, often slipping from one place of cover to another or, if that is not possible, acting as if you are doing something else, such as reading through a data-slate, scrutinizing a wanted poster or anything else that makes you blend in with your environment. A Shadowing Test is always an Opposed Test, pitting your Skill against your opponent's Awareness skill (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill).

A single Shadowing Test is sufficient to follow your opponent unseen for one minute.

# **Silent Move (Basic) Agility**

Use the Silent Move skill whenever you want to creep about without making a noise. The Difficulty depends on the surface on which you walk—broken glass, twigs, gravel and so on, can all make extra noise. A Silent Move Test is always an Opposed Test, pitting your Skill against your opponent's Awareness skill (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill).

A Silent Move Test is usually a Free Action made as part of a Move Action.

# **Sleight of Hand (Advanced) Agility**

The Sleight of Hand skill is used to palm objects, pick pockets or perform tricks with small items like coins and cards. The smaller the object, the easier it is to pick up, which is reflected in the task's Difficulty as set by the GM. In most cases, a Sleight of Hand Test is an Opposed Test, pitting your Skill against your opponent's Awareness skill (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill).

You may also opt to use Sleight of Hand instead of Gamble to hide cards up your sleeve or palm dice. See the Gamble skill for more information.

Sleight of Hand is usually a Half Action. You may make a Sleight of Hand Test as a Free Action, but you worsen the Difficulty by –10.

# **Speak Language (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** High Gothic, Hive Dialect, Low Gothic, Ship Dialect, Tribal Dialect. Other languages may be available at the GM's discretion.

The Speak Language skill is used to communicate with others using a common tongue. Although the people of the Imperium are widely scattered, they are united by an official tongue—that of Low Gothic. However, every world has its own local dialects and peculiarities, and sometimes even its own language. Under normal circumstances, Tests are unnecessary if all speakers know the language.

**High Gothic**: The language of nobility, law and Ecclesiarchy liturgy.

**Hive Dialect**: A debased form of Low Gothic unique to a given hive.

**Low Gothic**: The common tongue of the Imperium.

**Ship Dialect**: Code, slang and idiom unique to a given vessel.

**Tribal Dialect**: The rough and primitive tongue spoken by the natives of a particular planet.

A Speak Language Test is usually a Free Action.

# **Communicating Without Language**

In a place as vast as the Imperium, player characters are likely to encounter xenos that are not enlightened by the glory of the Emperor and are ignorant of the favoured tongue. Whilst many Acolytes may be inclined to purge the xenos with a well-placed shot from a bolter, there may be times when communication is necessary. In these cases, a character must use pantomime to get his point across. To do so, the character must make a Fellowship Test and the target must make an Intelligence Test. Obviously, phrases such as "he's behind you" are relatively easy to deliver, whilst more complicated comments might be very difficult, or even impossible to deliver. Each degree of success on the Fellowship Test grants the target a +10 bonus to its Intelligence Test to figure out what the character is saying. A failed Fellowship Test indicates that the message is incomprehensible. A failed Intelligence Test means the wrong message comes across, which may result in unfortunate consequences.

# **Survival (Advanced) Intelligence**

You use the Survival skill to subsist in the wild. This Skill encompasses such activities as fishing, game hunting, making fires, finding edible food, constructing improvised shelters, finding safe resting places, and so on. The Difficulty of the Test depends on the environment, with death worlds being much more difficult to survive on than an agri-world.

Failing a Survival Test usually indicates that you have failed to find what you are looking for, either because you are inept or because it is simply not there to be found. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that you fail spectacularly, usually by bringing trouble down on your head—perhaps by triggering a rockslide, or stirring up a den of angry silt-bears or foolishly consuming poisoned berries.

A Survival Test takes one hour, with each degree of success reducing this time by ten minutes. Under certain circumstances, like trying to find a crude shelter from a meteor storm, the Difficulty can be increased and the time taken reduced to one minute.

# **Swim (Basic, Movement) Strength**

The Swim skill is used to swim and dive. Swimming under normal conditions does not require a Test. However, Tests may be called for when waters are rough or when swimming for an extended period is required. For more information on the Swim skill, see Swimming in **Chapter VII: Playing the Game, [page 214](#page-214-0)**.

The Swim skill assumes a character is attempting to swim in water, but on alien worlds a character might encounter unusual substances such as lakes of sulphuric acid. The Difficulty of the Test might be increased to represent particular conditions. Swim does not protect a character from harm when swimming in toxic or otherwise dangerous liquids, nor does it negate the need for protective clothing.

A Swim test is a Free Action made as part of a Move Action.

# **Tech-Use (Advanced) Intelligence**

A character may use Tech-Use to repair mechanical items and to work out how unusual technical artefacts work. When using a basic, simple piece of mechanical equipment under normal circumstances, such as a vox or auspex, no Test is required. A Tech-Use Test is needed if the item is unusual, malfunctioning or conditions are especially troublesome, such as attempting to use an auspex during an electrical storm, or trying to get an ancient warp engine to start up after a thousand years' disuse.

Tech-Use may also be used to repair faulty or damaged items, the difficulty depending on the complexity of the item and the damage dealt to it.

Tech-Use might sometimes be used to build an item from scratch, although a relevant Trade skill is more commonly used.

A Tech-Use Test to figure out how an item works usually takes one minute, but might take less or more time depending on the complexity. A Test made to repair an item can take much longer, usually one hour but reduced by ten minutes for every degree of success.

# **Tracking (Advanced) Intelligence**

The Tracking skill is used to follow prey, be it animal or otherwise. Following obvious tracks requires no Test and can be done without slowing down. However, any instance when climate, lighting or terrain conditions would interfere always require a Tracking Test. The Difficulty depends on the quality of the prints and the circumstances. For example, a recent snowfall would make tracking prints Difficult (–10) or even Hard (–20). When following obscure tracks, the tracker's Movement rate drops to half.

Sometimes you will be following quarry that has attempted to cover its tracks, in which case this becomes an Opposed Test made against the quarry's Concealment Test result.

You may also make Tests to deduce your distance from the quarry, their numbers and their racial type.

A Tracking Test is a Free Action made as part of a Move Action.

# **Trade (Advanced, Crafting) Various**

**Skill Group:** Agri (S), Apothecary (Int), armorer (S), Artist (Ag), Cartographer (Ag), Cook (Int), Copyist (Int), Embalmer (Int), Mason (Ag), Merchant (Fel), Miner (S), Prospector (S), Scrimshawer (Ag), Smith (S), Soothsayer (Fel) Tanner (S), Technomat (Int), Valet (Fel) and Wright (Int). Others may be available at the GM's discretion.

Having a Trade skill indicates that you know how to practice a trade or craft. With this Skill, you can make a living or create items suited to your trade. You can also make a Trade Test to identify the handiwork of a particular craftsman, or to know something about a particular item. See **[page 96](#page-96-0)** for rules on Crafting.

A Trade Test normally represents a day's hard work. A Trade Test made to identify an item or craftsman is usually a Full Action, during which time the tradesman sucks his teeth and sighs before making his prognosis.

**Agri:** Used to grow, care and harvest crops and animals.

**Apothecary:** Used to blend and prepare herbal remedies.

**armorer:** Used to create and maintain armor and weapons.

**Artist:** Used to create works of art.

**Cartographer:** Used to take accurate measurements and turn them into maps.

**Cook:** Used to create and identify food.

**Copyist:** Used to swiftly copy text, illuminate manuscripts and forge written material.

**Embalmer:** Used to prepare and preserve corpses.

**Mason:** Used to assess and construct stone buildings.

**Merchant:** Used to find, bargain and sell trade goods.

**Miner:** Used to extract minerals, maintain mines and identify common hazards.

**Prospector:** Used to find and identify valuable materials.

**Scrimshawer:** Used to inscribe patterns, text and imagery onto materials. **Smith:** Used to forge metals into

shape.

**Soothsayer:** Used to give the appearance of telling the future.

**Tanner:** Used to prepare and tan hides.

**Technomat:** Used to maintain mechanical and tech items, often without any understanding of a machine's true purpose.

**Valet:** Used to refine the appearance, give droll asides and tend to the needs of superiors in a gentlemanly fashion.

**Wright:** Used to assess, design and construct buildings, vehicles and the like.

# **Wrangling (Advanced) Intelligence**

This Skill may be used in order to ride domesticated animals of appropriate size.

The Wrangling skill also allows you to care for and control domesticated animals, like bloodhounds, Spike Pigs, horses, Grox and the like. Routine care and feeding requires no Test. Tests are most commonly made to spot developing illnesses or signs of discomfort, or for special grooming (preparing a mount for a parade, for instance).

Wrangling can also be used to train animals to perform tricks and obey simple commands. Properly training an animal takes some time. Tests should be made once a week during training. A simple trick can be learned with one successful Test, a moderately difficult trick can be learned with three successful Tests and a difficult trick can be learned with ten successful Tests. Common tricks include guarding, fetching, attacking, and so on.

You may also use this Skill to befriend animals. Domestic animals are always friendly to you. Wild animals or those trained to be hostile (like attack dogs) can be calmed with a successful Test. GMs may impose penalties for particularly loyal or ornery animals.

Wrangling is of no use against cyberanimals such as familiars, even if they are built to resemble an animal.

A Wrangling Test takes a variable amount of time, depending on what the character is attempting to accomplish. Training an animal takes at least a week of hard work, whereas attempting to befriend an animal is a Full Action.
