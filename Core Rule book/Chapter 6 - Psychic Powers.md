*"My blade can shear through adamantium as if it were paper, but it is a blunt club compared to the edge of my will."* — Inquisitor Kaede, Ordo Hereticus.

W Within the Imperium of man, some people are born different. Some fickle turn of fate or chance twist in the genome has seen them join the growing ranks of psychic individuals within the human race. These psykers labour under a blessing and a curse. They have the rare talent to draw power from the warp, the hidden dimension of Chaos that lurks beneath the fabric of reality, and shape it into all manner of strange and supernatural effects. Using such power, however, comes with a terrible risk.

Whether they know it or not, the mind of each psyker shines brightly within the otherworldly dimension of the warp, or immaterium as it is also known. This psychic realm is home to unspeakable beings, hungry predators that look upon such soulfires with great anticipation. The denizens of the immaterium warp beasts, Daemons and worse—find great sport in weak and unprotected minds. An unwary psyker is easily attacked, consumed or used as a gateway from the warp to the physical realm.

Psykers are regarded in many different ways across the Imperium's countless worlds. On the more primitive planets, they are thought of as shamans, witches and sorcerers. More sophisticated societies are usually aware of psychic abilities and refer to psykers by other titles such as "gifted" or "the touched". But in almost all cases, and on all worlds, they are feared for the darkness and chaos they can bring down on those around them.

There are many that believe psykers represent a gross perversion of all that humanity is, and a constant reminder of the terrible powers of the warp. This idea seems to hold some weight as the majority of psykers succumb to madness and ruin, often at the cost of countless other lives. Those that can master psychic power, however, become a prized, if somewhat dangerous, commodity to the Imperium. The Inquisition, especially, makes great use of psykers in rooting out the enemies of mankind, fighting fire with fire as it were.

*"The dominion of Man the Animal is done. The age of Man the Psyker has just begun!"*

— Heretic Thaylon Sol, final words.

*"Man only spoke of it once. He say bein' psyker not so unlike us spine-divers. Spend all your time with your parts in sea-dark, awaitin' the day when d' fang-fish bite."*

— Spectoris Agri-hand, Dermay.

*"If the worst happens, and your Savant-Warrant falls to corruption, pray the Psykana conditioning holds. If you're lucky, he'll fall upon his mercy blade before anything too terrible can manifest. If he doesn't open his veins… well, that's a whole other lecture."*

— Officer Training, Gunmetallicus 104th.

# Types of Psykers

There are many roles within the Imperium that utilise psykers in some way or another. Some of these roles are revered and vital, whilst others are reviled utterly. However people feel about psykers, they are as much a part of the vast Imperium of Man as the Imperial Guard, the Administratum and even the Emperor Himself.

# **Astropaths**

These psykers are capable of transmitting messages across the vast distances of space. Though frequently inexact, arriving too late, and occasionally lost all together, these psychic transmissions are the best means the Imperium has of communicating across its enormous volume of dominion. Astropaths are part of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, an Imperial organisation dedicated to recruiting and training psykers. Most astropaths are blind, a side effect of the agonising Soul Binding ritual which forms part of their initiation.

# **Imperial Psykers**

These psykers are individuals deemed strong enough to serve the Imperium without significant dangers to others. These psykers serve in many parts of the Empire of Man, nominally as vassals to the Adeptus Astra Telepathica; from the Administratum to the Imperial military, within merchant houses or even for planetary governors. Imperial psykers often blend into their seconded post with surprising skill. Clad in monkish robes or secure behind scholarly titles, they often appear indistinguishable from the vast ranks of Administratum scribes. That is, until they must call upon their eldritch powers. Others serve within carefully constructed roles such as the Savant Militant of the Imperial Guard. Sanctioned psykers follow various schools of training, known collectively as the Scholastica Psykana. Much like the Imperial Creed, the exact teachings of the Scholastica Psykana may vary from sector to sector (or even planet to planet) yet the intent remains the same training dutiful psykers to serve the Imperium.

# **Navigators**

These unusual mutants have the ability to navigate the precarious tides of the warp with the aid of third eye that allows them see into the immaterium. Vital to space travel, Navigators have close ties to the Imperial Navy, Rogue Traders, and many powerful houses. Not so much an organisation as a series of bloodlines and families, the Navis Nobilite are closely watched by the Imperium, for every warp-capable Navigator is sorely needed.

# **Sacrifices**

The Black Ships of the Inquisition sweep up great tides of psykers as they ply their way across the Imperium. The vast majority of the psykers gathered in this way are found to be too weak and pliant in soul to stand against the corruption of the warp. They are passed to the care of the Adeptus Astronomica. This august body helps the Emperor maintain the Astronomican, the great psychic beacon of Terra. By burning the very stuff of their souls, the Astromonican's martyrs power the Emperor's Golden Throne, sending astral light flaring through the warp. By providing a single fixed point, the Astronomican forms a vital part of warp travel, allowing Navigators to effectively triangulate their position. Perhaps a thousand such martyrs are sacrificed to the Emperor in this manner each day. Most consider this a small price to pay in return for the protection and guidance offered by the Master of Mankind.

# **Latent Psykers**

There are some psykers that are unaware of their abilities. They may hail from a primitive world ignorant of proper ways, or else their powers might manifest in subtle ways, such as strange luck with dice, "poltergeist activity", uncanny hunches and so on. These psykers might never be detected, or more likely they might become host to all manner of warp corruption. Some might be infected with weird psychic parasites which slowly gnaw away at their mind until insanity results. Others might become host to Daemons, or even be snatched away into the warp to make a plaything for the Ruinous Ones which lurk there. Some have been known to flower into full-blown psychic ability—a phenomenon known as emerging—under stress, often with spectacular results. In any case, latent psykers are considered dangerous weak points, and the agents of the Black Ships do not shy away from hunting them down.

Witches & Psykers

The people of the Imperium fear that which is different strange or unusual brutal and unforgiving nature of the . Such is the *41*st Millennium that this mindset is a wise survivalstrategy. Unusual growths, rumours of deviance, supposed magic powers or simple unpopularity are often enough to see a person branded a witch and lynched, burned or worse. The paranoid fear of witches is common throughout the Imperium, and many innocent souls are sacrificed upon the altar of hysteria. Those accused of being witches might be psykers but just as often they are simply a wizened crone ugly misfit or drooling simpleton. Some cultures add charges of witchcraft to other crimes for reasons political and otherwise. For example, a charismatic sed tionist within the mines of Sepheris Secundus might be tried as a traitor and warlock. His followers might be described as being enchanted or bewitched into acting against their baron technology such fears still run deep . Even on planets with advanced . A dissolute hive world noble might be mind cleansed by his family for treating with the occult or having heretical psychosis. One of the more common tasks of the Inquisition is discovering if a witch has any real connection with the warp or if their crimes are of a more domestic nature. The majority err on the side of guilt just to be sure

Whilst sorcerers, witches and, to some extent, latent psykers are feared and hated by the common man. Imperial psykers and Astropaths enjoy a different status a measure of orthodoxy and authority to these psykers marking them as part of the Imperium . Sanctioning imparts . After all the Imperial psyker has made the great pilgrimage to Holy Terra and beheld the Emperor's light first hand. Whilst the common man will almost certainly be full of awe and fear at the psyker's presence it is little different to the feeling he might experience when encountering a commissar or an Administratum tax prefect. That said, Imperial psykers usually take pains to avoid making their abilities too apparent Mob rule and superstitious rage is never far away particularly when psychic phenomena begin to manifest. Astropaths are usually sequestered far away from the public gaze but even they are conscious that their presence is unsettling for the blunt masses. Most folk will never have heard of a Navigator, let alone seen one for they are a rare breed which is kept closely cloistered and hard at work. On the rare occasions that they deal with humansociety like other orthodox psykers they choose to hide from plain sight.

# **Sorcerers**

Some psykers choose the path of damnation in their quest for power. Heeding the whispered lure of Daemonic promises, they give up their souls in return for secret knowledge, raw power and mastery of things that man was not meant to know. These psykers embrace the Dark Gods as their lords and masters, making vile pacts to further their own depraved avarice. They are despised and feared for their unnatural practises and Daemonic taint. The Inquisition regards these sorcerers as highly dangerous foes, for they often act as doors through which Daemons may enter realspace.

# **Untouchables**

Untouchables are individuals who have no warp signature. They are not psykers, in fact they are completely the opposite. Their presence frequently acts as a damper on psychic activity, lessening or even completely halting its effects. Untouchables, like psykers, actually have different grades of "ability", though few savants have actually been able to study them closely due to their extreme rarity. Their strange aura makes most folk uncomfortable around them, and for this reason they are often loners, outcasts and pariahs. Of all Imperial institutions, the Inquisition makes the greatest use of Untouchables.

# **MEASURING PSYCHIC ABILITY**

Psychic ability typically manifests between the ages of ten and twenty, though there are psykers who have emerged in infancy or later in life. What triggers latent psychic ability is unknown to Imperial scholars, though not for lack of trying. Only the rare psyker is strong enough to "stand alone" against the terrible dangers inherent in possessing psychic abilities. Even the majority of the strongest psykers still require a great deal of training to effectively utilise their abilities. In order to be properly trained, each psyker needs to go through a reckoning of their powers.

Assessing the capabilities of a psyker is a difficult and imprecise art. The primary consideration is the psyker's strength against predation and corruption from the warp. Sanctioneers have many ways of measuring this peculiar strength of will, from demanding years of devotional training, to simply intuiting with a glance. Those deemed weak and pliable are granted the Emperor's mercy, or sent to join the throngs of martyrs on Holy Terra. Those who have the strength to resist the maddening touch of the warp and exhibit some control over their gifts are then divided into groups and types, according to their powers, raw ability and finesse. Some are soul bound and become Astropaths. Others are sent out by the Adeptus Astra Telepathica to serve in various roles and to study under the auspice of the Scholastia Psykana.

Using Psychic Abilities

# **Psykers In Dark Heresy**

For the sake of clarity, Psykers in Dark Heresy have been graded on a Psy Rating scale of 1–6. This is very much game terminology, designed to make the rules simple and easy for you to use. In the 41st Millennium, Psyker abilities are not so cut and dried! There are many names for the different levels of Psyker, each with their own subtle meanings and significances. Whilst you, the player, might happily discuss Psy Ratings, your character would not know what "Psy Rating 3" means. For an idea of how differing Disciplines of psychic study grade their members, take a look at **Table 6-1: Scholastica Psykana Calixis**. This is an example of how the larger schools of the Scholastica Psykana within the Calixis Sector describe their initiates.

Each tradition or branch of the Scholastia Psykana has a different method for measuring psychic ability. Some grade the individual on raw power; from the flickering power of an Omicron Grade psyker, to the world shattering awe of the Alpha Grade psyker. Others prefer to group their novices by the Discipline they study, whilst others still rate the psyker on the level of training and finesse they have attained. This rating might follow a scientific numeral system, depend on mystical degrees of initiation, or use any method in between. However it is measured, the psyker is expected to study the traditions, Disciplines, powers and obligations of the Scholastia Psykana with the utmost devotion.

# **Am I A Psyker?**

To be formally considered a Psyker in game terms, a character must have one of the Psy Rating talents. However, there are other ways to gain Psychic Powers, especially minor ones, through Talents, Traits and even drugs. It is also possible for a character with some psychic ability to improve their level of power, effectively increasing their Rating. For details on the effects of the various Psyker Ratings and other Talents that grant Psychic Powers see **Chapter IV: Talents**.

# USING PSYCHIC ABILITIES

*"When you stare into the warp, the warp stares back into you."* — Scholastica Psykana aphorism.

T To use a Psychic Power, a Psyker directs his will into the sea of the immaterium, pulling forth power from the warp to create an effect in realspace. To do this, the Psyker must make a Focus Power Action. They then make a Power Roll by rolling a number of dice up to their Psy Rating (typically 1–6) and adding their Willpower Bonus. Compare the total of the roll to the Power's Psychic Threshold (PT). If this number equals or exceeds the PT, the power takes effect. Otherwise, the Psyker has been unable to gather the necessary power, or perhaps they have been repelled by something in the warp and the power fails.

# **Example**

 *Elyra Yivor, a Psyker with Psy Rating of 2, tries to activate a power with a PT of 13. Her Psy Rating of 2 means she can roll two dice and adds her WP Bonus, meaning she will roll 2d10+3. Rolling the dice she scores a total of 15. As she has beaten the PT she has managed to manifest the power.*

*Characters with the Invocation skill can take a Full Action prior to trying to manifest a power to gain a bonus to their Power Roll (see Chapter III: Skills)*

*Note that a Psyker need not roll all of their dice when making a Power Roll.*

# **Psychic Phenomena**

When a Psyker focuses their power they invite the very essence of the warp into the real world causing such things as frost to cover nearby surfaces, ghostly whispers to fill the air and statues to weep tears of blood. These psychic disturbances are rarely dangerous (most of the time). However, they do instantly alert others to the presence of the Psyker and even harmless effects can cause the superstitious citizens of the Imperium to flee in terror.

# **Example**

*Elyra Yivor is trying to conjure a Fire Bolt to smite her foes. As she has a Psy Rating of 2 she rolls two dice and adds her WP Bonus. Rolling the dice she scores a 4 and an 9. Adding these together and her WP Bonus she scores a total of 16, enough to manifest the power. However, as she rolled an 9 she must also roll on Table 6-2: Psychic Phenomena. Rolling on the table she scores a 13. So even as she flings her fiery bolts, a Grave Chill fills the air around her.*

When a Psyker rolls an 9 on any of the dice used to manifest a power, they will invoke Psychic Phenomena and must roll on **Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena, [page 162](#page-162-0)** once for each 9 rolled. Psychic Phenomena can open the doorway to darker things and can cause a Psyker to conjure the Perils of the Warp.

**Note:** It is possible to successfully manifest a power and still cause Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp.

# **Psychic-Foci**

One of the principle ways a Psyker can enhance or control his powers is through the use of Psychic-foci. There are many different types of psychic-foci, which range from simple tricks that are known to help focus the mind when using certain abilities, to some exceedingly rare and sophisticated devices crafted by the Adeptus Mechanicus designed to boost or amplify Psychic Power. The most famous psychic-foci in the Imperium is doubtless the Emperor's Tarot, which helps act as a powerful divinatory tool in the hands of a trained Psyker. In mechanical terms Psychic-foci add a bonus to a Psyker's Invocation skill Test. For details on Psy-focus see **Chapter V: armory, page 151**.

# Table 6-2: Psychic Phenomena

# **Roll Effect**

- 1–3 **Dark Foreboding:** A very faint breeze blows past the Psyker and those near him, and everyone gets the eerie feeling that something unfortunate has just happened somewhere in the galaxy.

- 24–26 **Haunting Breeze:** Moderate winds whip up around the Psyker for a few seconds, blowing very light objects about within 3d10 metres.
- 27–29 **Veil of Darkness:** For a brief moment (effectively the remainder of the round) it seems to everyone within 3d10 metres of the Psyker that night has fallen, plunging the area into darkness.
- 30–32 **Distorted Reflection:** Mirrors break and other reflective surfaces distort or ripple within 5d10 metres of the Psyker.
- 33–35 **Breath Leech:** Everyone (including the Psyker) become short of breath for a round and cannot make any Run or Charge Actions.
- 36–38 **Daemonic Mask:** For a fleeting moment the Psyker takes on a Daemonic appearance and gains a Fear Rating of 1 for the remainder of the Round, but also gains 1 Corruption Point.
- 39–41 **Unnatural Decay:** All plants within 3d10 metres of the Psyker wither and die.
- 42–44 **Spectral Gale:** Howling winds erupt around the Psyker, lifting him slightly into the air and forcing both him and anyone within 4d10 metres to make an Easy (+30) Agility Test or be knocked to the ground.
- 45–47 **Bloody Tears:** Blood weeps from stone and wood within 3d10 metres of the Psyker. If there are any pictures of people or statues in this radius, they appear to be crying blood.
- 48–50 **The Earth Protests:** The ground suddenly shakes and everyone (including the Psyker) within a 5d10 metre radius must make a Routine (+10) Agility Test or be knocked down.
- 51–53 **Psy Discharge:** Static electricity fills the air for 6d10 metres causing hair to stand on end, while the Psyker rises 1d5 metres into the air, falling back to earth after a second or two.
- 54–56 **Warp Ghosts:** Ghostly apparitions fill the air for 3d10 metres around the Psyker, flying around and howling in pain for a few brief moments. Everyone in the radius must make a WP Test or gain 1 Insanity Point.
- 57–59 **Falling Upwards:** Everything within 2d10 metres of the Psyker (including him) rises 1d10 metres into the air as gravity briefly disappears before falling to the ground after a second or two.
- 60–62 **Banshee Howl:** A deafening keening sounds out for a kilometre, shattering glass and forcing everyone in the area (including the Psyker) to make a Toughness Test or be deafened for 1d10 Rounds.
- 63–65 **The Furies:** The Psyker is thrown to the ground by unseen hands and thrashes about for a few moments as winds howl about within 6d10 metres of him, lifting up light objects and forcing those in the area to make Agility Tests or be blown down.
- 66–68 **Shadow of the Warp:** For a split second the world changes in appearance and everyone within 1d100 metres has a glimpse at the heart of the warp. Everyone in the area (including the Psyker) must make a WP Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 69–71 **Tech Scorn:** The machine spirits reject your unnatural ways. All tech devices within 5d10 metres malfunction momentarily and all ranged weapons Jam (see **Chapter VII: Playing the Game**).
- 72–74 **Warp Madness:** A violent ripple of discord causes all creatures within 2d10 metres (with the exception of the Psyker) to become Frenzied for a Round and gain a Corruption Point.
- 75+ **Perils of the Warp:** Invoking the Psychic Power calls down a maelstrom of warp energy power. Roll on **Table 6-3: Perils of the Warp, [page 163](#page-163-0)** and apply the results to the Psyker.

# **Perils of the Warp**

The warp is a dangerous and unpredictable entity and every time a Psyker draws from it he risks insanity, death and ruin. When a Psyker invokes Psychic Phenomena there is a chance that it might actually indicate that something far, far worse has occurred. Psykers who have rolled 75 or more on **Table 6-2: Psychic Phenomena** must immediately roll on **Table 6-3: Perils of the Warp**.

In addition to any other effects, whenever a Psyker invokes the Perils of the Warp he gains 1 Corruption Point.

# Table 6-3: Perils of the Warp

**Roll Effect**

- 01–05 **The Gibbering:** The Psyker screams in pain as uncontrolled warp energies surge through his unprotected mind. He must make a Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 06–09 **Warp Burn:** A violent burst of energy from the warp smashes into the Psyker's mind, sending him reeling. He is Stunned for 1d5 Rounds.
- 10–13 **Psychic Concussion:** With a crack of energy the Psyker is knocked unconscious for 1d5 Rounds and everyone within 3d10 metres must make a Willpower Test or be Stunned for a Round.
- 14–18 **Psy-Blast:** There is an explosion of power and the Psyker is thrown 1d10 metres into the air, falling to the ground (see **[page 210](#page-210-0)** for Falling Damage).
- 19–24 **Soul Sear:** Warp power courses through the Psyker's body, scorching his very soul. The Psyker cannot use any powers for one hour and gains 5 Corruption Points.
- 25–30 **Locked In:** The power cages the Psyker's mind in an ethereal prison. The Psyker falls to the ground in a catatonic state. Each Round thereafter, he must spend a Full Action to Test Willpower. On a success, his mind is freed and restored to his body.
- 31–38 **Chronological Incontinence:** Time warps around the Psyker. The character winks out of existence and reappears in 1d10 Rounds (or one minute if you're using Narrative Time).
- 39–46 **Psychic Mirror:** The Psyker's power is turned upon him. Resolve the power's effects as normal but the power targets the Psyker instead. Should the power be of benefit, it instead deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage to the Psyker and the beneficial effect is cancelled. armor offers the Psyker no protection against this Damage.
- 47–55 **Warp Whispers:** The ghostly voices of Daemons fill the air within 4d10 metres of the Psyker. Everyone in the area (including the Psyker) must make a Hard (–20) Willpower Test or gain 1d10 Corruption Points.
- 56–61 **Vice Versa:** The Psyker's mind is thrown out of his body and into another nearby creature or person. The Psyker and a random being within 50 metres swap minds for 1d10 Rounds. This may include fellow Acolytes, or even enemy combatants. Each creature retains its Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship during the swap, but gain the other Characteristics of the new body. Should either body be slain, the effect immediately ends. Both beings are strangely revolted by the process and are unable to meet each other's gaze for some time afterwards. Each gains 1d5 Insanity Points for the experience. If there are no creatures within this range, the Psyker must make a Willpower Test or become catatonic for 1d5 Rounds whilst his mind wanders the warp and gains 1d5 Insanity Points.
- 62–67 **Dark Summoning:** A Lesser Daemon (see **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists**) pops into existence within 3d10 metres of the Psyker for 1d10 Rounds or until it is slain. It detests the Psyker and trains its attacks on the fool that summoned it.
- 68–72 **Ethereal Storm:** All sentient creatures (including the Psyker) within 1d100 metres take 1d10 Energy Damage that ignores armor.
- 73–78 **Blood Rain:** A psychic storm erupts, covering an area of 5d10 metres. In addition to whipping winds and raining blood, any Psychic Powers used in the area automatically invoke the Perils of the Warp for 1d5 Rounds.
- 79–82 **Cataclysmic Blast:** The Psyker's power overloads, arcing out in great bolts of warp energy. Anyone within 2d10 metres of him (including the Psyker) takes 1d10+5 Energy Damage and all of the Psyker's clothing and gear are destroyed, leaving him naked and smoking on the ground.
- 83–86 **Mass Possession:** Daemons ravage the minds of every living thing within 1d100 metres for 2d10 Rounds. Every character in the area must Test Willpower at the start of their Turn. A failed Test indicates that the character must spend his entire Turn fighting off the attack and counts as helpless. Characters that also fail the Test gain 1d5 Corruption Points.
- 87–90 **The Surly Bonds of Earth:** Reality buckles and all gravity within 1d100 metres reverses for 1d10 Rounds. All creatures and unattended objects begin to lift off the ground at a rate of three metres per Round. At the end of this time, reality asserts itself and everything comes crashing down, likely dealing Damage to all those affected.
- 91–99 **Daemonhost:** The Psyker must immediately pass a Very Hard (–30) Willpower Test or be possessed by a Daemon and become a Daemonhost! Create an Unbound Daemonhost (See **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists**) that will immediately attack. Only the destruction of the Daemonhost will free the Psyker (though he may die anyway if his body is destroyed in the process). If the Psyker does somehow manage to survive this result, he automatically gains 4d10 Corruption Points.
- 100 **Warp Feast:** A rift in reality is torn open and the Psyker is sucked into the warp with a little burping noise. He is no more.

# **OVERBLEED**

A Psyker sometimes channels more warp energy than he requires to manifest a power. In most cases he bleeds off the excess into the immaterium and it is lost. However, with some powers it is possible to funnel this energy directly into manifesting greater effects. If a Psyker beats the power's Psychic Threshold by a certain amount he will gain extra effects, such as increased Range, Damage or Duration. If a power has this ability, it is mentioned in the entry along with the extra effects of Overbleed.

# Sustaining Psychic Abilities 

There are a number of Psychic Powers that are worth "keeping on" for an extended length of time. Powers that can be used in such manner are referred to as being "sustainable", which is noted in their entries. Sustaining a Psychic Power for an extended period of time is very taxing and only the most proficient Psykers can accomplish it. Every 10 Rounds a power is active, the Psyker must make a Power Roll to maintain it—just as if he were rolling to manifest it. Unlike a normal Power Roll, this is performed as a Free Action at the start of the Psyker's Turn and cannot invoke either Psychic Phenomena or the Perils of the Warp.

# **Sustaining Multiple Powers**

A Psyker can sustain a single Psychic Power without much effort once properly activated. However, all Power Rolls the Psyker makes while sustaining a single Psychic Power are reduced by 4. A Psyker can sustain multiple powers, but all Power Rolls get progressively more difficult as he must expend more and more of his power on maintaining the powers already in effect. A Psyker sustaining two powers reduces all Power Rolls by 8 while a Psyker sustaining three powers reduces all Power Rolls by 16. It is not possible to sustain more than four powers at once. These penalties to the Power Roll also apply to sustaining powers already in effect.

# **Cumulative Effects**

Modifiers, Characteristic Bonuses, and other benefits generated by Psychic Powers do not stack. If two powers provide the same kind of bonus, such as an increase in Strength, then only the highest applies.

# Detecting Psychic Powers 

All Psykers can, to a greater or lesser degree, feel the movements of the immaterium about them. They are very sensitive to the warp's ebb and flow, often feeling when others of their ilk reach out to touch the psychic currents about them. All Psykers can Test Psyniscience when Psychic Powers are used in their presence in order to help determine the source (see **Chapter I[II: Skills](#page-105-0)**, **page 105** for details on this Skill).

# Psychic Powers

*"Power Corrupts?"*

— Traditional meditation of the Scholastica Psykana.

T The remainder of this chapter presents an assortment of the most common Psychic Powers found in the Imperium. These are certainly not all of the powers that might be found, even within the specific Disciplines. The Imperium is a vast and strange place and nearly anything is possible.

# Minor Psychic Powers

While Psykers may aspire to mastering the Psychic Disciplines, the reality is that most never rise far above only being able to manifest minor powers and effects. This plethora of lesser abilities is collectively known as Minor Psychic Powers and often forms the standard arsenal of most Psykers. Unlike the more powerful Disciplines, these powers are relatively easy to learn and use. Minor Psychic Powers can be purchased by spending Experience Points on the relevent Talents (see **Chapter IV: Talents**).

# The Psychic Disciplines

There are a number of different groupings of psychic abilities, which are referred to as Psychic Disciplines by the savants of the Imperium. Because each Psychic Discipline requires a certain type of training and well, discipline, it is easier by far for a Psyker to learn multiple powers from one Discipline then try to learn from another. Mastering a specific Psychic Discipline is considered to be a great milestone for a Psyker.

**Biomancy:** The art of sculpting flesh to conform to one's will.

**Divination:** The art of reading past, present and future in the shadows of the immaterium.

**Pyromancy:** The art of controlling heat and flame.

**Telekinetics:** The art of translating thought into physical force.

**Telepathy:** The art of reading and controlling minds.

# **Discipline Mastery**

Once you have learnt ten or more powers of a particular Discipline, you are said to have mastered it. When manifesting any power within the Discipline reduce the power's PT by 5. Those who have mastered a Discipline are extraordinarily powerful, capable of manifesting powers quickly and efficiently.

# Power Format

All powers use the following format.

# **Power Name**

**Threshold:** This is the amount of accumulated energy needed to manifest the power.

**Focus Time:** This entry describes the length of the Focus Power Action required to manifest the power.

**Sustained:** Yes or No. If yes, the power's effects remain in play for up to 10 Rounds. Beyond this, you must make Tests to keep the power active. If no, the power's effects may remain in play or be instantaneous, though in either case the Psyker no longer needs to maintain them.

**Range:** This entry describes the power's Range. This is expressed in one of four Ranges: "You" indicates that the power can be cast only upon yourself; "Touch" indicates that you must touch a target—a Weapon Skill Test—for the power to take effect; "Touch (You)" functions as touch, but you can also manifest the power on yourself; and "Metres or Kilometres" indicates that the power takes effect at the listed distance. A description of the power's effects follows.

**Overbleed:** If the power has additional effects for exceeding the threshold, it is listed here. Otherwise this entry is absent.

# Minor Powers

Minor Psychic Powers are tricks and knacks that those with even a shadow of psychic ability can learn. They are nothing compared to the "true" Disciplines, but are useful nonetheless.

# **Call Creatures**

| Threshold:  | 9           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |

You call a number of simple-minded creatures within range to travel to your location. Creatures called depend on the nature of the environment, though the sorts of creatures called may include rats, ash slugs and other

kinds of vermin. If no such creatures are likely to be in the area, the power has no effect. Under most circumstances, 1d10 such creatures appear after 2d10 minutes have passed. The creatures are not compelled to serve the Psyker; they simply appear and behave as normal for their species.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the powers Range by 1km.

# **Call Item**

| Threshold:  | 5           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | Unlimited   |
|             |             |

You summon a specially prepared item to instantly appear in your hand. To prepare the object, you must spend one hour in deep meditation, infusing the object with your psychic imprint, and marking it with glyphs and runes. The object must be small and light enough to be carried in one hand. You may only have one prepared item at a time.

# **Chameleon**

| Threshold:  | 7           |     |     |     |
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |     |     |     |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |     |     | Yes |
| Range:      | You         |     |     | You |

You cause reality to blur around you, distorting your image and allowing you to blend in with your surroundings. You gain a +30 bonus to Concealment Tests. In addition, all opponents using ranged weapons to attack you suffer a –20 penalty to their Ballistic Skill Tests.

# **Déjà vu**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 30m         |

You create a brief memory loop in the mind of the target, causing their thoughts to slip back several seconds in time. You must be able to see the target and they must be within the range of the power to be affected. They are also permitted a Willpower Test to resist its effects. If they fail to resist, however, they must repeat the same Action that they took last Round in their next Turn, be it firing a gun at a target that is no longer there, continuing to run from slain enemy, or diving for cover from a grenade that has already gone off. Any action that would obviously be harmful to the target, such as running off a cliff, automatically allows them to resist the power.

# **Distort Vision**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Free Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

With this power, you disappear and your image reappears in another space no more than 10 metres away. Until the start of your next Turn, you are effectively invisible to all other creatures, defeating even sensory equipment. All attacks against you, should your position be discovered by means of a Psyniscience Test, are Very Hard (–30). Creatures and sensors that do not rely on sight are not affected by this power.

# **Dull Pain**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |
|             |             |

You can nullify the pain of any creature, including yourself, within Range. The target of this power reduces their levels of Fatigue by one step.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you remove an additional level of Fatigue.

# **Fearful Aura**

| Threshold:  | 7           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You twist reality in such a way as to make you appear more sinister and dangerous. You become the source of dread for anyone who looks upon you. Whilst this power is active, you have a Fear Rating of 2. See **Chapter VIII: The Game Master, [page](#page-232-0) [232](#page-232-0)** for details on Fear Ratings.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, your Fear Rating increases by 1.

# **Flash Bang**

| Threshold:  | 6           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 20m         |

You create a bright flash of light and a deafening bang. Anyone within Range must succeed on a Routine (+20) Willpower Test or become Stunned for 1 Round.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, the Difficulty worsens by one step, from Routine (+20) to Ordinary (+10), from Ordinary (+10) to Challenging (+0), and so on.

# **Float**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You focus your concentration and slowly begin to lift off the ground. You can only move up and down while under the effects of this power, and you cannot rise higher than 5 metres. You can use this power to stop yourself from falling, but you must succeed on a Difficult (–10) Willpower Test in addition to beating the PT.
# **Forget Me**

| Threshold:  | 6           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |

You become instantly forgettable to a single creature within range. They can't seem to recall having met you before this very instant and you effectively suppress all memories of your previous encounters. The target is entitled to an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test to resist this power. Their memory returns after 1d10 minutes.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may do any of the following: extend the effects of this power to either one additional target, add an extra 1d10 minutes to the duration, or worsen the Difficulty of the Willpower Test by one step.

# **Healer**

| Threshold:  | 7           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |

You channel your power into a single target to knit flesh and mend bones. You may only use this power on a willing target, including yourself. The target of this power removes 1d5 points of Damage (removing Critical Damage first).

Repeated uses of this power can be dangerous, however, not to mention painful, and the person's flesh rebels against the intrusion of warp energy. If a person (including the Psyker) is the subject of this power more than once in a 6 hour period, they must Test Toughness or take 1d5 points of Damage (with no reduction for Toughness Bonus or armor), rather than being healed.

# **Inflict Pain**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | 100m        |

You cause a person to be wracked with agony, filling their minds with unspeakable pain. The target is entitled to a Willpower Test to resist the effects of this power. On a failed Test, the target suffers a –10 to all their Tests as they struggle to control their pain.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold you can extend the effects of this power to affect another target.

# **Inspiring Aura**

| Threshold:  | 6           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You seem to glow with an inner light and all those around you are filled with confidence. While this power is active, all allies that can see you gain a +20 bonus to Tests made to resist Fear and Pinning. They may also feel compelled to say nice things about you. Which is nice.

# **Knack**

| Threshold:  | 7           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

You tap into your unconscious to awaken a deeper understanding of your capabilities. Until the end of your next Turn, you may gain a +10 bonus to any one non-combat Test. After this point, your enlightened mood fades.

# **Lucky**

| Threshold:  | 6           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

It is said that luck acts strangely around Psykers, no doubt in part to powers like this one. When you manifest this power, any time before the end of your next Turn, you may re-roll any one roll of your dice (including Damage rolls).

# **Precognition**

| Threshold:  | 6           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You get a fuzzy picture of what will occur a few moments into the future. As you draw nearer to the event, the picture becomes clearer. For as long as this power is active, you gain a +10 bonus to Dodge Tests and to Weapon Skill Tests made to Parry incoming blows.

# **Psychic Stench**

| Threshold:  | 5           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | Touch       |

By momentarily handling an item you imbue it with an unnatural psychic smell. Anyone coming within five metres of the tainted item will smell it, regardless of barriers or other smells present. What a person smells when around an item affected by psychic stench depends on what they find most distasteful, so the aroma can vary greatly. As the smell only exists in a person's mind, it will also affect creatures that do not have a sense of smell or have had their sense of smell impaired. Psychic stench remains in effect for 1d10 days, after which time it dissipates.

# **Resist Possession**

| Threshold:  | 6        |
|-------------|----------|
| Focus Time: | Reaction |
| Sustained:  | No       |
| Range:      | You      |

You create mental wards to shield your mind from the malign denizens of the warp. Any time in the next hour you may re-roll any failed Test to resist being possessed by a Daemon.

# **Sense Presence**

| Threshold:  | 7              |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action    |
| Sustained:  | Yes            |
| Range:      | 50m (see text) |
Reaching out with your mind, you get a vague inkling of other life forms within range. You automatically detect all living creatures in the area. Walls in excess of 1 metre thick block this power.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by an additional 10 metres.

# **Spasm**
| Threshold:  | 7           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 50m         |

You cause a target's muscles to spasm. The target is entitled to a Willpower Test to resist this power. On a failure, the target twitches in an uncontrollable and possibly amusing way. If the target is carrying any ballistic weapon, the weapon goes off—make a Ballistic Skill Test as normal to hit the closest creature. In addition, the target immediately falls to the ground and must use a Stand Action to regain their feet.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may either affect an additional target or worsen the Difficulty of the Willpower Test by one step.

# **Spectral Hands**
| Threshold:  | 10          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 30m         |

You create an invisible force that you can use to manipulate any object within 30 metres. The force has a Strength Characteristic equal to your Willpower. This power lasts until the end of your next Turn. You can use it to knock over objects, push buttons, pull levers or do any number of other things requiring force. You cannot perform any action that requires precision, such as typing on a dataslate, pulling the pin from another creature's grenade, pull a trigger, and so on. In addition, Spectral Hands has no effect on living targets.

# **Staunch Bleeding**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |
You cause yourself or another creature within Range to halt Blood Loss. See **Chapter VII: Playing the Game, [page 211](#page-211-0)** for details on Blood Loss.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may affect another target.

# **Torch**

| Threshold:  | 5           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

By burning the very stuff of your thoughts, you create a ball of glowing psy-flame. The light cast by Torch is equivalent to a glow-lamp. The ame may issue from any point on your body. The ame is roughly the size of your palm, and pulses slightly in time with your heartbeat. It may be coloured according to your whim. The light produces no heat.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold you may double or half the size of the light or cause it to float up to one metre from your body in any direction.

# **Touch of Madness**

| Threshold:  | 11          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 100m        |

You reach into the mind of a target within Range and force them to believe something that just isn't true. The target is entitled to a Willpower Test to resist this power. On a failed Test, the target must roll 1d100 and consult **Table 8-6 Mental Traumas** on **[page 235](#page-235-0)**.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you affect an additional target.

# **Trick**

| Threshold   | 5           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You subtly influence the fields of probability flowing around you, making you especially good at cheating at games of chance. If you do not have the Gamble skill, you gain it at two levels of mastery for as long as the power is sustained. If you have Gamble, you gain an additional +20 bonus to Gamble Tests. If you already have Skill Mastery in Gamble, this power has no effect, as you are already that good.

# **Unnatural Aim**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

You draw upon the power of the warp to guide your aim. Before the end of your next Turn, any ranged attacks you make count as being made at Point Blank Range (+30 to hit).

# **Wall Walk**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You bend gravity to your will. You negate all penalties incurred by low- or high-gravity worlds. In addition, you can walk on walls or ceilings for as long as this power is active. You move across such surfaces at half your normal rate. You must also Test Agility to go between a wall and ceiling and vice versa, unless you take a Full Action to ease yourself onto the new surface.

# **Warp Howl**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 50m         |

You send out a long, keening screech throughout the warp that tears through into reality in a cacophonous burst. This power drowns out all sound within Range for 1 Round.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by 10 metres.

# **Weaken Veil**

| Threshold:  | 9           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | 30m         |

You weaken the fabric of space within 30 metres by drawing the immaterium closer. Anyone within Range that uses Psychic Powers gains a +2 bonus on Power Rolls. However, as the veil between worlds is weakened, Psychic Phenomena occur on the roll of an 8, 9 or 10.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by an additional 10 metres.

# **Weapon Jinx**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 50m         |

You reach into nearby machines with your mind to scramble their circuitry. All mechanical devices within range cease to function for 1 Round. In addition, you may Test Willpower to force a single weapon within range to jam. The jammed weapon can be cleared as normal (see **[page 196](#page-196-0)**). Note that the Adeptus Mechanicus are especially loathing of this kind of ability and tend to take a very dim view of Psykers that employ it.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 10 metres, or you can affect an additional weapon.

# **White Noise**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | 10m         |

You fill the warp with static, fouling psychic detection and making tech sensors less reliable. While active, any Tests made to detect your presence, as well as that of anyone within range of you, using either psychic or technological means, count as Hard (–20). If the means of detection would not normally require a Test, the user must make an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test if using psychic means, or an Ordinary (+10) Intelligence Test if they are using technological means.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 10 metres.

# **Wither**

| Threshold:  | 6           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 3d10m       |

You cause a vile wave of invisible pestilence to emerge from your body, extending out to the Range of the power. The wave withers all normal plant life in the area in a matter of moments, leaving the area barren and utterly dead.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 1d10 metres.

# Psychic Disciplines 

Psychic Discipline reflect a deeper understanding of a Psyker's capabilities and allow him to manifest some of the most destructive powers known to Man. A Psyker that has mastered one or more Disciplines is truly a horror to behold, capable of such things as reducing his enemies to ash, repairing torn flesh in the blink of an eye, and even defying the march of time itself.

# Biomancy

Biomancers specialise in manipulating bio-electrical energy with their minds. They are masters of the flesh, learning to shape and direct their bodies according to their wills. Biomancers are often considered venal souls. Most are viewed with no small amount of jealousy, as they freely feast and drink, yet maintain a healthy, toned physique.

# **Bio-lightning**

| Threshold:  | 14          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |

You channel your life force through the meridians of your body, causing your form to crackle with living energy. You may direct this energy against a single target within Range. The target takes 1d10 plus your Willpower Bonus in Energy Damage.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range of this power by 10 metres. For every 10 points that you exceed the Threshold, you can launch another bolt of energy against the same or a different target.

# **Blood Boil**

| Threshold:  | 19          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | 10m         |

With a rhythmic crushing gesture, you tune into an enemy's body, flexing their heart muscles to accelerate their pulse. This continues until their blood pressure reaches lethal levels. As you continue to exert your will, blood vessels begin to rupture, causing haemorrhaging across the target's body. Each Round (including the Round in which the power manifests), you may spend a Half Action to make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against your target's Toughness. If you win the Test, your opponent takes one level of Fatigue plus one level of Fatigue per degree of success, until he collapses un-conscious. Each level of Fatigue beyond those that the target can take deals 5 Damage instead. Should Damage equal the target's Wounds, their heart and brain explodes, showering gore around.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you gain a +10 bonus on your Opposed Willpower Tests.

# **Cellular Control**

| Threshold:  | 16          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You learn various ways of transcending your body's natural limitations by balancing your humors, modifying cellular structure and meditating upon the meridians of your body. This power enables you to achieve any one of the following effects:

• Gain immunity to all poisons.

• Ignore the effects of extremes of temperature.

• Increase any Characteristic except Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill—by +10.

• Gain immunity to Fatigue.

• Count as though wearing a void suit in a vacuum (though you still need to breathe).

Each Round you sustain this power, you must succeed on a Toughness Test. On a failed Test, you take 1d5 points of Damage, ignoring your Toughness Bonus and armor as your body begins to break from the strain.

Unlike most powers, you can manifest this power multiple times. Each time, choose a different effect.

# **Constrict**

| Threshold:  | 13          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |

With a word, thought or gesture, you can command the flesh of your target to sharply contract. The target's windpipe closes, choking them and cutting off their breath. They begin to Suffocate. (See Suffocation on **[page 210](#page-210-0)**) Each Round, the target must spend a Full Action to Test Toughness. On a success, they regain control over their body and clear their windpipe. On a failure they continue to suffocate. The target is considered to be engaged in strenuous activity.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the Threshold, the Difficulty of the Toughness Test worsens by one step.

# **Enhanced Senses**

| Threshold:  | 10          |  |
|-------------|-------------|--|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |  |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |  |
| Range:      | You         |  |

With a moment's thought, you force your senses into impossible feats of perception that can only be equalled among humans by the biomechanically augmented. When you manifest this power, choose one of your five senses. You gain a +30 bonus to all Tests made with this sense. The sense organ involved becomes strained as you push it past all normal human limits; the eyes weep and grow hugely dilated, skin flushes red, the nose drips mucus and so on.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may enhance an additional sense.

# **Hammerhand**

| Threshold:  | 15          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

Biomancers who have learned to channel the fierce power of the warp into their limbs can eventually master the art of letting the energy of the immaterium flow unhindered through their body, phenomenally increasing their fighting capabilities. Your body becomes a lethal engine, capable of shredding flesh and bone as if they were tissue paper. Such power comes at a cost though, for there is no subtlety to the Hammerhand. While this power is in effect, your Strength Bonus is multiplied by 4, and you gain the Natural Weapon trait (see **[page](#page-330-0) [330](#page-330-0)**) However, you can wield no weapon save for your bare hands (not that you need any!).

# **Regenerate**

| Threshold:  | 23          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

One of the pinnacles of a biomancer's abilities, this power allows you to knit your flesh back together at a phenomenal rate, letting you swiftly overcome any non-fatal injury. This is a hard ability to master, but the rewards are great—Regenerate can eventually regrow lost limbs and organs. Each Round this power is active, you remove 1d5 points of Damage (removing Critical Damage first) and have all levels of Fatigue removed. Once all Damage is removed, you begin to regrow lost organs, limbs, and so on. Limbs and organs replaced by cybernetics do not regrow unless the bionic is first removed.

# **Seal Wounds**

| Threshold:  | 10          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |

You focus your power to repair your damaged flesh or that of any character within Range. Ragged wounds fuse and cuts vanish. Broken bone knits together, and burnt skin sloughs away as fresh tissue grows beneath. The target of this power removes 1d10 points of Damage plus an amount of Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus. This power can remove Critical Damage as well as normal Damage.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may achieve any of the following: extend the Range by 10 metres, target an additional character within Range, or remove an additional 1d10+WB Damage from the target.

# **Shape Flesh**

| Threshold:  | 19          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

Shape Flesh is the point where your flesh and will become indistinguishable—the goal of many a biomancer. Shape Flesh allows you to twist your physical frame in nearly any way you can imagine. Each manifestation of this power produces one of the following effects:

• Gain any one of the following traits—Burrower (1), Crawler, Dark Sight, Flier, Hoverer, Natural armor (2), Natural Weapons or Quadruped. These traits are described in **Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics & Antagonists, [page 329](#page-329-0)**.

• Assume the appearance of any one creature. You may make Disguise Tests as if you had the Disguise skill and at a +10 bonus. If you already have the Skill, you gain an additional +20 bonus.

• Gain Natural Weapons (Bite, Claws, and so on) to deal 1d10+SB Damage.

Unlike most powers, you can manifest this power multiple times. Each time, choose a different effect.

# **Toxic Siphon**

| Threshold:  | 11          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | Touch (You) |

You draw poisons from the flesh. This has the same effect as taking a dose of de-tox (see **Chapter V: armory, [page 148](#page-148-0)**) with the exception that the target must lose a Full Action as the toxin expels itself from the body naturally.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may draw poison from an additional target, who must be touching you or another person being purged by you.

# **DIVINATION**

Diviners seek to discern the hidden past and know the course of future events. Their abilities allow them to look into the immaterium to find the answers they seek. Their art is horribly taxing, though. The warp lies heavy on diviners; many of them are morose and sullen individuals. Insanity is common amongst their ranks. Divination is the most widely known Psychic Discipline, mainly due to use of the Emperor's Tarot.

# **Divine Shot**

| Threshold:  | 15          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Free Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

Using this power enables you to make near impossible ranged shots, allowing you to strike virtually any target you can perceive. You must concentrate on a single firearm or other missile weapon in your possession and the ammunition it carries before casting your psychic gaze into the warp to search down the near-infinite paths of potential future trajectories. When you find the one you seek, you shoot, and while the damage to the target may vary, the attack cannot be avoided in any way. In effect, you automatically hit any one target you can see regardless of Range. Only one shot automatically hits, even if you are using a semi-automatic or automatic weapon. All other shots require Tests as normal.

# **Dowsing**

| Threshold:  | 11          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

By focusing his mind the diviner can single out an object or person somewhere in his immediate vicinity, pushing aside all other distractions until he can unerringly find it. First the Psyker must choose an item or person to be the subject of the power. This can be anything, but it must be a specific item. So for instance, the Psyker could say, "I want to know where the key to this lock is" but not "I want to know where a key is". Likewise with a person, the Psyker must have either seen them before (possibly remotely or in a pict) or know their name. Simply trying to find the person who murdered the governor, for example, will not work.

| Soul Sight                   | 23        | Full Action   | Yes     |

Once the Psyker has chosen his subject, he makes a Pysniscience Test. The following factors modify this roll:

• He is intimately familiar with the subject (an object he has been carrying for a long time or a person he knows well): +10

• He has a portion of the subject (a lock of a person's hair, a stone chip from a statue): +5

• The subject is within 100m: +5

• The subject is over 500m away: –10

• Subject is surrounded by others of its kind (i.e. a person in a crowd, a key in a draw full of keys): –10

If the Psyker passes the Test, and the subject is within a number of kilometres equal to or less than his Perception Bonus, then he will have some idea of its location depending on how many degrees of success he scored.

### **Degrees of Success Result**

- 0 The rough direction of the subject
- 1 The specific direction of the subject and a roughly how far away it is
- 2 The specific direction of the subject and exactly how far away it is
- 4 A visual image of the current location of the subject as well as knowledge of in which direction and how far away it is

As long as the Psyker sustains this power he can spend a Full Action to gain updated information on the location of the subject (the level of this information remains dependant on his original degrees of success). Thus, a Psyker can follow a person who is actively trying to evade them for instance.

# **Far Sight**
| Threshold:  | 17                  |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action         |
| Sustained:  | Yes                 |
| Range:      | 1km/Willpower Bonus |

Some diviners are capable of opening their inner eye to perceive events that occur at places far away from them. Far Sight may be used to make you aware of a single space anywhere within Range of this power. You need not be aware of the destination; you merely need to identify how far away you need to cast your senses (for example: "I look two kilometres to the west"). Should the point you select be inside a solid object, such as a wall, tree, cliff face or the like, the power simply fails. You may use Far Sight to cast your view inside buildings, bodies of water, pockets of gas and so on without impediment.

Once you have cast your sight to a particular place, you can see up to the normal range of your vision from a specific point of view. You may change your facing by 90-degrees by spending a Half Action. Once you choose your point, you may not select another. You must use the power again to select a new point. Far Sight does not grant any special forms of vision; if your clairvoyant point is within a darkened room and you cannot normally see in darkness, you perceive nothing but darkness. In addition, Far Sight does not pick up sound (though if you have the Lip Reading skill, you can use it to work out what speakers are saying).

While under the effects of this power, you are disoriented and cannot spend more than a Half Action each Round. In addition, you take a –30 penalty to all Tests.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you can double the Range of this power.

# **Glimpse**

| Threshold:  | 18          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

You peer into the future, sensing the manifold web of different possible pathways and potential outcomes. Until the end of your next Turn, you gain a +30 bonus to any single Skill Test.

# **Precognitive Strike**

| Threshold:  | 17          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Free Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

Like a spider on a web, you are able to sense disturbances to your immediate future. This ability to read possible outcomes lets you anticipate the movement of your opponents. Until the end of your next Turn, you gain a +20 bonus to all Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests.

# **Precognitive Dodge**

| Threshold:  | 11          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Free Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | You         |

You may manipulate probability to your own advantage. The threads of your immediate future appear clearly in your mind. You have the power to Dodge projectiles before they've been fired. When you manifest this power, you can walk into combat with what appears to be astounding grace (or incredible luck), weaving your way through fields of gunfire without a scratch. Until the end of your next Turn, all Ballistic Skill Tests made to hit you with ranged weapons suffer a –30 penalty.

# **Preternatural Awareness**

| Threshold:  | 9           |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

Casting your perception from the limited vessel of your bodily senses, you gain an unnatural awareness of the world around you. Your eyes roll white within their sockets and your senses roam about you, at once glancing above, behind, before and sideways. You also gain impressions of future events, granting you uncanny accuracy in anticipating them. You gain a +20 bonus on all Awareness Tests. In addition, you add your Willpower Bonus to your Initiative count.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may add your Willpower bonus to your Initiative again.

# **Psychometry**

| Threshold:  | 16             |

Intense displays of emotion leave a psychic "residue" on objects and places exposed to them. Similarly, anything that has been actively carried or used by an individual for a long time will eventually pick up similar psychic impressions. With this power, you can read the psychic traces that others leave behind, giving you images directly connected to the place or object in question. These traces often take the form of sensory data. For example, a diviner may taste the hot blood-tang of murder, or smell the rank sweat-stench of desperation.

You may use this power in one of two ways. First, you may use it to divine the impressions of an object, or, second, you may use it to divine psychic impressions in an area. In the case of the former, you must be handling the object. In the case of the latter, you may divine any pertinent details that occurred within a number of metres equal to your Willpower Bonus.

The quality and nature of the information depends on how long you sustain the power. You derive a new piece of information for every ten Rounds you spend handling an object or concentrating on an area.

#### **Rounds Result**

- 10 You sense the most recent strong emotion associated with the area—love, hated, amusement, fear and so on.
- 20 You perceive the general features of the person who experienced the emotion.
- 30 You get a clear image of the features of the person who experienced the emotion.
- 40 You are able to identify the person's occupation (e.g. Career and Rank).
- 50 You are able to discern the name of the person.
- +10 You discover an additional fact about the person as determined by the GM.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you cut the time required by half: if you exceed the PT by 10 points, you derive a new fact every 5 Rounds; if you exceed by 20 points, every 2 Rounds; and for 30 points, every Round.

# **Personal Augury**

| Threshold:  | 14          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | Touch       |

Personal Augury allows you to peer into the fate of a single, willing target. You may warn the querant of impending dangers, opportunities and even divine specific advice for your client. To begin the augury, you clasp the hands of your client, and ask them to specify a circumstance that they wish divined. This may be as detailed as, "What terrors does the headquarters of the Barbed Chalice hold?" or as vague as, "How can I please my Inquisitor?" The more precise the question, the more specific the reading may be. Once the question is established, the diviner and client spend the next thirty minutes using his Psychic-foci. This may be reading the Imperial Tarot, casting runes, examining entrails, or any other such act. At the end of this time, you may make a Psyniscience Test to accurately sense the weave of the client's future. Each degree of success reveals more information.

### **Degrees of Success Result**

- 0 **Doom:** The diviner receives a symbolic warning of the greatest peril or obstacle faced by the client with regards to the question. This is a vague hint at what is to come.
- 1 **Malign Influences:** The diviner gains intuition of the client's doom, and a further two negative influences that the client will face.
- 2 **Benign Factors:** The diviner gains an additional impression of the greatest advantage or weapon the client has in their possession.
- 3+ **Fate:** The diviner is aware of all of the previous effects, and may also offer a single sentence of mystical advice to the client.

# **Soul Sight**

| Threshold:  | 23          |

Diviners are said to be able to read a person's shifting aura, the ghost self they unconsciously project into the warp. From observing the nature of this aura, they can learn many things about a person's emotions and feelings: from their current emotions, to habitual moods, to their levels of injury, and even any addictions or madness they may suffer from.

When this power is manifested, the diviner may try to read the aura of any person they can see as a Full Action. This requires a successful Psyniscience Test with each degree of success granting him more information. The diviner must manifest this power each time he wishes to view an additional person's aura.

### **Degrees of Success Result**

0 **Hue.** You focus on the dominant colours in the target's aura. This allows you to detect the strongest three emotions they are currently experiencing. You are also able to detect their race, and if they have any Psychic Discipline Powers (though not what they are). From the brightness and consistency of the aura, you are also able to gain a rough idea of the target's physical and mental health. This does not tell you their exact Wounds or Insanity Points, but rather grants a loose impression (good, poor, slightly weak, and so on). Finally, you may tell whether the target is an Untouchable.

1 **Flow.** You gain all the impressions of the previous result, and also gain a greater understanding of their emotional state. You can read all of the target's current feelings. You also gain an insight into the target's nature and their habitual tides of sentiment (depressive, misanthrope, optimist etc). These perceptions grant you +10 to all Fellowship Tests made against the target whilst this power is active. In addition to this, you can see undercurrents of emotion caused by biological feedback, such as hunger, desire, fatigue, intoxication and pain. You may determine the target's current Wounds and Fatigue levels. Finally, if the target has any Psychic Discipline Powers, you may tell which Disciplines these powers originate from (though not which specific powers these are).

2 **Shape.** You gain all the impressions of the previous result, and gain a greater understanding of the target's longstanding emotions and emotional states. The aura's connection to the warp around it reveals if the target has any Corruption Points (though not how many). Ripples in the aura reveal the three major emotions experienced by the target over the past twelve hours. You may determine the target's Insanity Points and any madness or addictions they are currently suffering from. If the target has any Psychic Disciplines, you may infer their precise Psy Rating.

3 **Pattern.** You gain all the impressions of the previous result, and gain a full appreciation of the target's aura. You may determine the exact Corruption Points of the target. You may also detect if the target has any Minor Psychic Powers (though not what they are). Finally, you may tell if the projected aura is genuine, or has been produced by some unnatural means (Psychic Power, Daemonic ability, technological means etc). Note that you cannot divine what the target's genuine aura should be; only that it is artificial.

Deemed by the majority of Imperial savants (those who are at liberty to discuss such matters, that is) to be both the most common and the most limited of Psychic Disciplines. Pyromancy is the art of creating and controlling fire. Students of this discipline are known as pyromancers or pyrokinetics. Less charitable souls, and some of those who've been on the receiving end of their abilities, frequently refer to them as "pyromaniacs". Few indeed, however, question the effectiveness of a master pyrokinetic on the battlefield.

**Note:** Any Pyromancy power that inflicts Damage may also set the target on fire; see **[page 210](#page-210-0)** for details of things catching fire.

# **Blinding Flash**

**Threshold:** 11 **Focus Time:** Half Action **Sustained:** No **Range:** 12m

You focus blazing mental energy into a single point within your mind before releasing it all in a burst of searing bright light, blinding anyone who sees you and is within Range. Those with appropriate glare shielding and beings that don't have visual sensory organs are immune. All those affected must make an Agility Test or be blinded for a number of Rounds equal to 1d10 times the Psyker's Psy Rating. Blinded targets automatically fail vision-based Tests, move at half normal speed and take a –20 penalty on any Test that involves fighting, movement or reactions. Note that a Psyker may accidentally blind himself with this power (if he's very stupid).

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you extend the Range by 4 metres.

# **Burning Fist**

# **Call Flame**

| Threshold:  | 8           |
|-------------|-------------|

| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

One of the first powers commonly learned in this discipline is to summon fire with thought. This allows you to conjure a small flame (about the size and intensity of a burning torch) into your palm. The primary purpose of this power is not to attack—though it adds 2 points of Damage to your unarmed attacks and makes them Energy attacks—but rather it is used to set things alight or as fuel for other Pyrokinetic powers, such as Sculpt Flame. While this power is in effect, you cannot use your hand for anything else besides holding the flame.

# **Douse Flames**

**Threshold:** 16 **Focus Time** Half Action **Sustained:** Yes **Range:** 5m × Willpower Bonus It takes a potent mind to deny the natural tendency of flames to run out of control. Douse Flames allows you to instantly extinguish all fires within range as well as interfere with fire-based weapons such as amers, causing them not to function for as long as they are within Range of the power although their fuel may still spray forth, depending on the design of the weapon. Note that chemically flammable substances, such as promethium, that burn continuously once exposed to the air, burst back into flame the moment the power's effect ends or as soon as the chemical is brought outside of Range.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you extend the Range by 5 metres.

# **Fire Bolt**

| Threshold:  | 11          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 100m        |


Fire Bolt allows you to create bolts of flame with your mind and hurl them at your foes. The appearance of these flames is up to you—for example, searing white light or green-black spheres of obscenitymouthing faces. You can direct the bolt at any target you can see within range. Make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test to strike the target. On a hit, the bolt deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which the Power Roll exceeds the Threshold, you generate an additional Fire Bolt, which can be directed at any targets within Range. Test Willpower for each separate target.

# **Fire Storm**

| Threshold:  | 16          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 50m         |

Fire Storm instantly creates an intense conflagration about your target as the air itself ignites, burning all within to cinders. You can call a Fire Storm anywhere within range to a point you have line of sight to. The Fire Storm has a 6 metre radius from the point (or individual) targeted. The Fire Storm deals 1d10+5 Energy Damage to all creatures and objects in the area.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you deal an additional 1d10 points of Damage.

# **Holocaust**

| Threshold:  | 23          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | 6m          |

A legendary ability that few pyrokinetics are strong enough to even wield, much less have the courage to use. Holocaust calls forth a raging white-hot firestorm ignited by the Psyker's own soul. The flames of a Holocaust burn across dimensions, affecting the entities of the immaterium as well as material beings, but the cost is high as the psyker risks losing his own spirit to the fury of the conflagration. The fires of a Holocaust always burn outward from you, dealing 1d10 Energy Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus to all creatures and objects in the area. This Damage bypasses Toughness Bonus and armor. You take 1d10+1 Energy Damage (ignoring Toughness Bonus and armor) each Round that you sustain this power. There is no immunity to the fires of a Holocaust and Warp Entities, as well as other immaterial creatures, are burned as readily as the fleshbound. Those slain by Holocaust are killed forever.

# **Incinerate**

| Threshold:  | 19          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | 10m         |

Incinerate allows you to generate intense heat as well as flame. By psychically agitating the molecules in a tightly focused area, you create an effect even more devastating than a meltagun. However, Incinerate requires you to concentrate on a single point, making it difficult to use against non-stationary targets. Incinerate has a range of 10 metres and deals 1d10+1 Energy Damage. Each Round, beyond the first, that you use a Full Action concentrating on the target (it must remain in Range and in line of sight) this power deals the Damage of the previous Round plus 1. Damage caused by Incinerate ignores both armor and Toughness.

# **Sculpt Flame**

| Threshold:  | 13                 |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Focus Time: | Half Action        |
| Sustained:  | Yes                |
| Range:      | 5m×Willpower Bonus |

You control the shape of the fires burning around you. With this power, you can intensify any flames or shape them to assume any appearance you desire. A successful use of this power allows you to do any of the following effects with an existing fire:

• Double a fire's area (assuming there are combustibles).

• Diminish a fire's area by half.

• Spread fire into a number of 1 metre squares in any direction equal to your Willpower Bonus.

• Create crude shapes that resemble creatures, body parts, people or objects.

• Cause a fire to burst, requiring all adjacent targets to Test Agility, catching fire should they fail the Test.

• Cause a fire to spew smoke, filling three times the area of the fire (treat as fog).

Each Round you can choose a new effect or apply the same effects to the same source of fire.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you can manipulate fire more efficiently. If you exceed the PT by 5 points, you can create easily recognisable images. If you exceed by 10 points, you can create near lifelike figures, as if carved from flame. You can increase the distance of spreading fire: for every 5 points you exceed the PT, the distance is double your Willpower Bonus; for exceeding by 10 points the distance is four times your Willpower Bonus and so on.

# **Wall of Fire**
| Threshold:  | 17          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Full Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | 60m         |

A relatively blunt, but effective, ability in the pyrokinetic's arsenal, this power allows you to place an immobile barrier of flame that lingers for as long as you will it. The wall is three metres high and a metre thick and can be up to ten metres long for every point of your Willpower Bonus. You can place it anywhere within Range and even on top of foes, though they are allowed an Easy (+20) Agility Test to get out of the way. Foes crossing the wall or failing the Test take 1d10+5 Energy Damage (ignoring armor) and must Test Agility again or catch on fire.

# Telekinetics

The art of the Telekinetic Discipline is to translate mental energy into physical force. Wielders of these powers are known as the telekine, and they readily break the laws of physics with their abilities. Telekine are notorious for their forceful personalities, which, while unpleasant to deal with, are fairly understandable. In many places, there is a common image of the telekine as a pallid, unfit and spoilt individual. In reality, Telekinetics often suffer intense migraines, nose bleeds and high blood pressure as a result of focusing their powers.

# **Catch Projectiles**

**Threshold:** 16 **Focus Time:** Reaction **Sustained:** No **Range:** 1m×Willpower Bonus You can use your telekinetic abilities to catch incoming projectiles. This power only works against solid projectiles and so energy attacks get through normally. Until the end of your next Turn, you automatically discount a number of hits from incoming missiles equal to your Willpower Bonus, causing them to immediately stop and hang in the air. When this power ends, they fall harmlessly to the ground.

# **Fling**

|     | Threshold:  | 14          |     |     |     |

|     | Range:      | 10m         |     |     |     |

You can telekinetically lift an unattended object from the ground and fling it at a target. You may lift up to 5 kilograms per point of your Willpower Bonus. You can throw the object a number of metres equal to your Willpower Bonus ×3. To hit a target, Test Willpower. On a success resolve the hit as if your Test was an attack. The object deals 1d10 Impact Damage plus 1 point per 5 kilograms of weight.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the Threshold, you may lift an additional 5 kilograms per point of your Willpower Bonus.

# **Force Barrage**

| Threshold:  | 21                  |

| Focus Time: | Full Action         |

This power functions as Force Bolt except you create one bolt per point

Use this power to hurl a burst of tangible mental force at your opponent. Test Willpower to hit the target. If you succeed, your attack deals 1d10 Impact Damage +1 Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you deal 1 additional point of Impact Damage.

If Telekinesis is a sledgehammer, then Precision Telekinesis is a scalpel. This ability allows you to achieve far more subtle effects with telekinetic force. At its most basic, this power can pull the pins on grenades, triggers, press buttons, jog undo latches and direct small projectiles to deadly effect. Essentially, with this power, you can manipulate objects as if you can manipulate objects as if you were physically handling them. In any situation where the task would call for a Characteristic Test you substitute your Willpower instead.
# **Psychic Blade**

| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

A phenomenally complicated ability to master, this power allows you to project your will as a blade of psychic force. Because the blade is formed of psychic energy, it can be formed almost impossibly thin, as little as a molecule thick. A Psychic Blade can thus shear through almost any physical object with ease, and is capable of cutting through most forms of armor as if they were made of cloth. The Psychic Blade is a terribly dangerous weapon to use, though, for any stray thoughts can misdirect it with devastating effect.

Once manifested, treat the Psychic Blade as a sword wielded by the Psyker (though it does not require a free hand) that requires no Melee Training to use, but cannot Parry. To strike with the Psychic Blade, the telekine uses their Willpower Characteristic rather than Weapon Skill. On a successful hit, the weapon deals 1d10 Rending Damage, plus 2 additional points of Damage per point of your Willpower Bonus. In addition, the weapon has Penetration equal to twice your Willpower Bonus.

# **Psychic Crush**

|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustain:    | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |

You can direct your Telekinetic power directly against your opponents, wrapping them in bands of force that constrict and crush the life out of them. Once manifested, you may use this power against any target within Range. Make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against your opponent's Toughness. If you beat your opponent, you deal 1d10 Impact Damage plus 1 per point of your Willpower Bonus. For each degree of success, you deal an additional 2 points of Damage.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may extend the Range by 10 metres.

# **Push**

| ----------- | ----------- |
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | No          |
| Range:      | 10m         |

You gather a ball of telekinetic energy and direct it against any single target within range. Make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against your target's Strength. If you beat your opponent, you knock them to the ground. For each degree of success, you also deal one level of Fatigue.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may extend the Range by 10 metres or gain a +10 bonus to your Willpower Test.

# **Telekinesis**

**Threshold:** 11 **Focus Time:** Half Action **Sustain:** Yes

**Range:** 10m Telekinesis is the ability to use the strength of one's will to move physical inanimate objects around. You may lift or move any object within Range, whose weight does not exceed 5 kilograms × your Willpower Bonus. You may move the object slowly anywhere within Range of the power. This power cannot affect living creatures. You cannot make attacks with objects you manipulate. Once you cease concentrating on the object, it falls slowly to the ground.

# **Telekinetic Shield**

| Threshold:  | 17          |
|-------------|-------------|
| Focus Time: | Half Action |
| Sustained:  | Yes         |
| Range:      | You         |

You erect a field of telekinetic energy about you. This field functions as a force shield, granting 1 armor Point on every location in addition to any other armor you are wearing. By spending a Full Action to activate this Psychic Power, you may opt to cause the Telekinetic Shield to vibrate at a colour frequency of your choosing (golden yellow, skull white, ice blue, and so on). Note that whatever its hue, the shield only produces a gentle shimmer in the air. It is not opaque and cannot block your opponent's line of sight.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you increase the armor Point by 1.

# **TELEPATHY**

The Discipline of Telepathy allows the practitioner to contact and control the minds of others. From outright mental domination to subtle perceptual effects, the telepath can shape and mould thoughts with but a whim. For all this power, telepaths tend towards misanthropic depression. All too easily they can detect the foetid overspill of thought and emotion that oozes from the human mind, leaving them under no illusions about the nobility of man's soul. As they grow in skill, many telepaths are unable to completely shut out the constant low level chatter of other minds. Consequently many develop great loathing for crowds of people. Along side this constant irritation, telepaths face another peril as they practise their art. By immersing themselves in another person's mind, they can often "catch" personality traits, mad beliefs or even psychic corruption. Sometimes a telepath can lose their selves entirely, becoming little more than a mirror of those around them, a tragic figure with dim memories of the individual they once were. Such telepaths are often given the mercy of mind cleansing and reassignment as some form of servitor.

# **Beastmaster**

**Threshold:** 13 **Focus Time:** Half Action **Sustain:** Yes **Range:** 8m

You may stretch out your thoughts to animals, becoming able to perceive their emotions and establish a rudimentary form of communication. The relative simplicity of an animal's mind allows you to dominate them. Affected animals must follow your every command. When you manifest this power, select one animal within Range. Each Round you sustain the power, you may spend a Reaction to give the animal a command. The command must be simple, such as "come", "guard", "flee", "heel", "attack" and so on. The animal follows the command to the best of its ability. If the animal feels threatened or is ordered to act in a way that is not suited to its nature, it may make a Willpower Test to break your control. How it acts if it succeeds depends on your treatment of it.

# **Compel**

**Threshold:** 17 **Focus Time:** Half Action **Sustain:** No **Range:** 8m

One of the most direct of all "psyker mind tricks", Compel allows you to force others into briefly acting against their own will. Compel is a highly versatile power, useful for both subtle and blatant effects. When you manifest this power, make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against the

target's. If you succeed, the target must follow your command. The nature of the command must be simple and must be able to be taken in a single Round. Good commands include "flee", "attack that target", "dance a jig", and so on. If the command would result in a suicidal act, the target gets a +20 bonus to its Willpower Test.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you gain a +10 bonus on your Opposed Willpower Test.

One of the most infamous of all telepathic abilities, you reach out with your mind to seize control of another's body. Make an Opposed Test, pitting your Willpower against the target's. If you succeed, you control your target's body as if it were a puppet. For as long as the power remains active, you may divide up your Actions between yourself and your target. For example, on your Turn, you might spend a Half Action to fire your laspistol at an Ork and then for your other Half Action, order your puppet to fire his bolter at the Ork. The dominated target uses its own Characteristics, but takes a –10 penalty to all Tests because it is controlled. Any action that could be deemed as suicidal grants the target a new Willpower Test to try and break your hold.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you gain a +10 bonus on your Opposed Willpower Test.

# **Closer Than Flesh**

Telepathy is an intimate act, more personal and affecting in some ways than any petty communion of the body. To slip into the consciousness of another is a disturbing and disorienting task, for no two minds are alike and there is no telling what a telepath may find within another's psyche. Unwilling targets of telepathic acts are apt to conceive of a deep loathing for the invading psyker, in some cases bordering on a psychopathic hatred for the telepath.

Aside from making enemies for himself, the telepath also risks mental contamination when he enters another person's mind. It is all too easy to take on the personality traits of another, or worse still be infected by the putrid pus of their madness. Psykers who are promiscuous with their powers often find their original personalities much altered, or even completely eroded, by continuous contact with foreign minds. Sad indeed is the fate of such lost souls. Worse than this loss of the self, however, is the fate of telepaths who stumble upon dark and corrupted souls. Chaos is all too willing to exploit the mental bridge that the telepath forges between his mind and his target. If a Psyker uses a telepathic power on a target who has twice his own Insanity or Corruption Points, he must make a Willpower Test. Should the psyker fail the Willpower Test, he contracts some form of psychic rot from his debased contact. Psychic rot inflicts 1d10 Insanity or Corruption Points on the Psyker, depending on which type of mental foulness caused the psychic rot in the first place. Should the target have both Insanity and Corruption Points equal to double the Psyker's own, the Psyker must make a second Willpower Test with failure resulting in the loss of a further 1d10 Insanity or Corruption Points.

| Focus Time: | Half Action |

| Range:      | 6m          |

You bolster your comrades by subtly implanting images of great courage, and masking various negative emotional stimuli, allowing them to swiftly shake off fears and doubts. A number of targets equal to your Willpower Bonus immediately overcome the effects of Pinning and Fear, and remain impervious to these effects for as long as they stay within Range and for as long as you sustain the power. Such psychic propaganda is frequently used amongst the Imperial Guard.

# **Mind Scan**

| ----------- | --------------- |
| Focus Time: | Extended Action |
| Sustain:    | No              |
| Range:      | Touch           |

With this power, you can read a target's mind, probing whatever secrets are hidden therein. You must touch the target for this power to work, which, unless clever methods are employed, means you must successfully Test Weapon Skill. If you manage to touch the target, you may enter a contest of wills in order to pierce your target's mental barriers and discover all sorts of information.

Mind Scan is a lengthy process, extending over five Rounds. During each of these Rounds the Psyker and target make Opposed Willpower Tests. If the Psyker succeeds, he may delve deeper into the target's psyche. Should the target succeed, it indicates that he has managed to thrust the Psyker from his mind, and the Mind Scan power ends.

Each Round that Mind Scan is successfully maintained, the following information is revealed:

### **Round 1 (Contact)**

**Information:** The Psyker contacts the target's mind, learning basic information such as name, mood, Insanity Level, physical health, and so on.

### **Round 2 (Surface Thoughts)**

**Information:** The Psyker investigates the thoughts which are uppermost in the target's mind, such as opinions on the Psyker, immediate fears, conscious lies, a single location, object, event or person which is significant to the target (such as a lover, personal hab block, treasured heirloom or cult initiation). It is not apparent why the significant thing is important—only the emotions associated with it. The target's Corruption Level is also apparent to the Psyker.

### **Round 3 (Short Term Memory)**

**Information:** The Psyker may rifle through the target's memories over the previous twelve hours, and may uncover two further significant locations, objects, events or persons. Again, it is not apparent why the significant thing is important—only the key emotions associated with it. The Psyker may also dredge up simple passwords and routine

behaviours from the target's mind (e.g. hab block entry code, habitual paths to work, bank ident numerals or frequently used Skills, Talents and Characteristics).

### **Round 4 (Subconscious)**

**Information:** The Psyker may gain detailed understanding of why significant locations, objects, events or persons hold importance to the target, and how they relate to each other. The target's beliefs, motivations and personal goals are apparent to the Psyker, as are the target's immediate network of contacts. Complicated ciphers may be extracted from the target's mind, and the Psyker is aware of pivotal moments in the target's life (earliest memory, adolescence, coming of age and so on).

### **Round 5 (Soul Baring)**

**Information:** The Psyker may plunder the target's mind at will. Any information contained within the target's psyche is there for the Psyker to do with what he wishes.

The Psyker may attempt to scan his target's mind covertly. In this case, the Psyker must make an Opposed Willpower Test at a -10 penalty. Should the Psyker succeed in a covert scan, the target gains a faint sense of unease, but is unaware that his mind is being probed.

If the Psyker does not attempt a covert scan, the target is fully aware that his psyche is under attack. He may attempt to break physical contact with the Psyker or even strike out.

You can send out your disembodied mind and spirit, allowing you to touch other minds from a great distance away. You project a "mental self ", which you can shape to look like whatever you choose. The projection can travel at great speed, literally the speed of thought, but it can also be vary dangerous as creatures native to the immaterium and other Psykers may be able to directly attack your mind. Whilst using Projection, you are completely unaware of what is happening with your physical body. This power lets you communicate with any creature you know well (such as a companion or your Inquisitor), and is somewhere within the same solar system. Unwilling targets, or possibly those that do not look kindly at having people invade their thoughts, may make an Opposed Willpower Test with the Psyker to force them back into their bodies. Whilst using this power, your body functions as if it were unconscious.

A voice's volume is limited to the realities of vocal capacity and a listener's ability to hear. Minds have no such limitations. With this power, you gather your will and launch it as a blast of screaming mental energy designed to overload nervous systems and knock one or more targets unconscious. All creatures within Range that you specify must succeed on a Willpower Test or suffer a number of levels of Fatigue equal to your Willpower Bonus.

**Overbleed:** For every 10 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may extend the Range by 10 metres.

You erase your presence from the minds of others. This power is more than just "invisibility"; targets that this power has been used successfully on literally cannot perceive you at all. While they may suspect that someone else is present, they can only react to the effects of what you do. For example, you could punch a guard while using See Me Not. The guard would know that he had been hit by "something" and would certainly do his best to find the source of the attack, in hopes of stopping a second blow, but he would look "right through you" while he was searching.

Upon manifesting this power, select a number of targets within Range equal to your Willpower Bonus. Each target must succeed on a Willpower Test or they can no longer perceive you for as long as you sustain the power. Lack of perception means they cannot directly attack you: they cannot see, hear, smell or perceive you in any way.

Oddly, this power has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence of 10 or less.

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, you may add another target or impose a –10 penalty on one target's Willpower Test made to resist this power.

# **Telepathy**

You can send your thoughts into the minds of those around you. You can choose to send your message to one or more persons in a select group of individuals, which is known as a "placed sending", or can transmit your thoughts to anyone within Range, an art known as "broadcasting".

# **Terrify**

You dredge up a person's worst nightmare and project it directly into their mind, causing them to flee screaming. You may affect a number of targets within Range up to your Willpower Bonus. Each target must pass a Willpower Test or roll on the Shock Table (see **[page 233](#page-233-0)**).

**Overbleed:** For every 5 points by which you exceed the power's Threshold, the target adds +10 to their roll on the Shock Table.
