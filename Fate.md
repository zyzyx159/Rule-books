## **The Role of Fate**

Acolytes are unusual people, individuals with abilities, backgrounds, and experiences that set them a cut above ordinary citizens of the Imperium. Your Acolyte has a destiny, and has been marked by the God-Emperor of Man to fulfil some greater purpose. As such, it is the role of Fate in an Acolyte’s life that truly separates him from the masses.

All Acolytes begin play with a number of Fate Points, which are determined at character creation. Depending on how pious your Acolyte is, using Fate could represent the Emperor's will working through him, a personal belief in his own destiny, or just being preternaturally "lucky".
## **Using Fate Points**

Fate Points allow you to manipulate situations to your advantage, mitigating bad results or swinging a mishap into fortune. Expending a Fate Point lets you strike true with a bolter shot against a heretic leader that otherwise would have missed, crack the security code on a door before a room fills with poison gas, or catch yourself making a social blunder that would blow your cover whilst infiltrating a cult hideout. Using these twists of fate, you can take a few more risks or get a second chance at an unfortunate dice roll, which makes the game faster and far more exciting.

That said, you would do well to spend your Fate Points prudently. You have a limited pool of Fate Points, and whenever you spend one you reduce your pool by one as well. Spent Fate Points are normally restored at the start of the next gaming session, although special circumstances may restore them in the middle of a session, or not at all, as the GM deems appropriate. 

A Fate Point can be used at any time, either on your Turn or in reaction to the action of another character or event. Spending a Fate Point is a normally a Free Action.

Spending one Fate Point allows for one of the following:

- Re-roll any one Test. The results of the re-roll are final.
- Count as having rolled a 10 for Initiative.
- Gain a +10 bonus to a Test. This must be chosen before dice are rolled.
- Add an extra degree of success to a Test. This may be chosen after dice are rolled.
- Instantly recover 1d5 Wounds. Note that this only affects Wounds, not Critical Damage.
- Instantly recover from being Stunned.
- Remove one level of Fatigue.

Note that certain Talents and Traits, such as Pure Faith, may allow for enhanced or alternative uses of an Acolyte's Fate Points.
## **Burning Fate**

Sometimes a re-roll or an extra degree of success is not going to be enough to save your Acolyte from certain death. In these instances, you may choose to burn a Fate Point, permanently reducing your Fate Points by 1 and avoiding your death. 

Normally, burning a Fate Point allows you to survive whatever would have killed you, but only just. For example, if you were shot with a lascannon and suffered a Critical Effect that would have killed you, instead you are "merely" badly burnt and rendered unconscious with zero Wounds. In more extreme circumstances, such as being trapped on a voidship during a warp drive implosion, it is up to you and the GM to work out just how your Acolyte manages to escape.

At the GM's discretion, a character that burns a Fate Point may have an extremely fortunate event, rather than a miraculous survival, save him from death. Such an occurrence would be highly variable and dependent on his situation. For example, an enemy about to cut down the Acolyte is suddenly crushed by a falling pillar, its base severed by the Acolyte's power sword whose attack the Round before missed the opponent.

Note that you may burn a Fate Point even if you have already used all of your Fate Points for that gaming session. This just means that at the start of the next session, when your points are restored, you will have 1 less Fate Point.
## **Gaining Additional Fate Points** 

Acolytes are awarded additional Fate Points at the GM’s discretion, which can replenish Fate Points that have been burnt, or increase your pool above that which you started with. Such rewards can be given out as the main adventure reaches certain milestones, for particular acts of heroism, cunning, or good roleplaying. In addition, you may have the opportunity to gain Fate Points by spending xp if your Career Rank Advance Scheme allows it, or the GM offers such an option for game play or story-related reasons.
## **Maximum Fate** 

Fate is a vital characteristic for an Acolyte and greatly increases his chances for survival in a deadly and uncaring universe where a stray bolt shell or vengeful chain blade can swiftly end his existence in a shower of blood and gore. For this reason, having at least a few Fate Points is of absolute importance. However, no matter how much luck or divine providence an Acolyte has invested in him, he should never feel as though he's truly in control of his own destiny.

Keeping that in mind, it is recommended that GMs **limit a character’s Fate Points to a maximum of five (5)**. Having numerous Fate Points can lead to situations where the players become blasé about situations in which their character might be killed, knowing that they have numerous ‘lives’ up their sleeve. The GM should also be aware of the increased combat potency which a large store of Fate Points grants a character, providing them bonuses to Tests, re-rolls, and instant healing. Finally, Fate Points are special and should feel that way. If a character only has 1 or 2 Fate Points remaining, the player is going to carefully consider how and when he spends them.

Should a situation arise where an Acolyte already has five Fate Points and would have been awarded a sixth for his efforts or achievements the GM should should devise an appropriate substitute that acknowledges the Acolyte's contributions without exceeding his maximum Fate.
