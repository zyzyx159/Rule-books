*"Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment."* — Concordium dogma.

In most ***Dark Heresy*** games it is largely unnecessary to worry about how fast a character can run or how long it takes him to ascend the exactly 500 stairs to the Temple of the Emperor's Ascension. There are, however, a number of situations within a game, notably during combat, when knowing how fast a character can move is very important. As discussed in **Combat**, there are two different methods of keeping time in a ***Dark Heresy*** game, Narrative Time and Structured Time, and each has its own unique rules regarding movement.
## **Structured and Narrative Time**

During Structured Time, which typically involves combat or other tactical movement, a character may take a specific Action during a Round to move at one of four speeds: **Half Move**, **Full Move**, **Charge**, or **Run**. The number of metres a character moves at these various speeds is dictated by his Agility Bonus, and can be further modified through some Talents or Traits. **Table: Structured Time Movement**, located below, gives more details on the various speeds.
#### **Table: Structured Time Movement**

| Agility Bonus | Half Move | Full Move | Charge | Run |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | --- |
| 0             | 1/2       | 1         | 2      | 3   |
| 1             | 1         | 2         | 3      | 6   |
| 2             | 2         | 4         | 6      | 12  |
| 3             | 3         | 6         | 9      | 18  |
| 4             | 4         | 8         | 12     | 24  |
| 5             | 5         | 10        | 15     | 30  |
| 6             | 6         | 12        | 18     | 36  |
| 7             | 7         | 14        | 21     | 42  |
| 8             | 8         | 16        | 24     | 48  |
| 9             | 9         | 18        | 27     | 54  |
| 10            | 10        | 20        | 30     | 60  |

Often during Narrative Time, when a character isn’t actively involved in combat or some other all-consuming, time-sensitive task, knowing how far a character can move in a given amount of time is, while perhaps not critical, still important to the story. Narrative Time Movement describes the standard speeds a character can move at a leisurely pace under ideal circumstances. Environment and terrain, discussed further below, and affect these speeds, helping or hindering the characters as they travel. **Table: Narrative Time Movement**, located below, gives more details on the various speeds.
#### **Table: Narrative Time Movement**

| Agility Bonus                 | Per Minute | Per Hour | Per Day† |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0                             | 12m        | 0.75km   | 7km      |
| 1                             | 24m        | 1.5km    | 15km     |
| 2                             | 48m        | 3km      | 30km     |
| 3                             | 72m        | 4km      | 40km     |
| 4                             | 96m        | 6km      | 60km     |
| 5                             | 120m       | 7km      | 70km     |
| 6                             | 144m       | 9km      | 90km     |
| 7                             | 168m       | 10km     | 100km    |
| 8                             | 192m       | 12km     | 120km    |
| 9                             | 216m       | 13km     | 130km    |
| 10                            | 240m       | 14km     | 140km    |
| †Assumes 10 hours of walking. |            |          |          |

### **Narrative Movement and Terrain**

Terrain conditions affect how fast your character can cover ground during Narrative Time. Slogging through a waist-deep snow-filled field is much harder than walking across the broad flagstone-paved courtyard. When moving through thick foliage, dense crowds, soft sand, deep mud, and other similar difficult terrain, a character’s movement is halved. Beyond this, the Game Master should determine what, if any, modifiers apply to Narrative Time due to the environment.
### **Hurrying**

A character can, when called for, pick up the pace by moving up to double his Narrative Time Movement for a number of hours equal to his Toughness Bonus. At the end of his exertion, the character must make a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1 level of Fatigue. In addition to the Fatigue, a hurrying character is distracted and prone to miss tiny details in his surroundings. Thanks to this he suffers a further –10 penalty to all Perception-based Tests.

In truly dire circumstances, the character may push himself to the limit and continue on despite his increasing exhaustion and penalties. In this case, the character must continue to make progressively more difficult Toughness Tests to avoid accruing more levels of Fatigue. For example, the character suffers a –10 penalty to his Toughness Test after the second time period, a –20 after the third, and so forth.
##### **Example**
*Lucretious is hurrying to reach a research outpost in order to use their vox-caster to contact his master, so he covers 12 kilometres per hour. His Toughness is 41, so he can hurry for four hours before he needs to Test Toughness or start gaining levels of Fatigue.*
### **Running and Narrative Time**

Characters can run during Narrative Time, but doing so is extremely tiring. When running, a character triples his rate of Movement. Each hour of sustained running requires the character to make a Toughness Test with a cumulative –10 penalty per each hour past the first to maintain his pace. Failing the Toughness Test inflicts 1 level of Fatigue. Running characters are even more focused on the task at hand than those simply hurrying, and suffer a –20 penalty to all Perception-based Tests. As in running, characters may push themselves past endurance after a failed test, but all penalties are cumulative.
##### **Example**
*Kyba has a Toughness Bonus of 3 and runs to reach the village ahead of a pack of feral Orks, some 30 kilometres away, who should arrive in four hours. She normally moves 4 kilometres per hour. But because she's running, she's moving 12 kilometres per hour, meaning she'll reach the village in just over two hours if she can sustain the pace. After the first hour of running, she Tests Toughness and fails. She takes 1 level of Fatigue. After her second hour, she's covered 24 kilometres, but she needs to Test Toughness again, this time at a -20 penalty. She fails again! Half an hour later, Kyba reaches the village exhausted, having taken 2 levels of Fatigue.* 
### **Forced Marching**

While the standard time for marching is ten hours in a day, nothing is stopping characters from continuing past that time. Characters may safely press on a number of hours equal to their Toughness Bonus. Beyond this, a character must make a Toughness Test with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour for each hour travelled beyond his Toughness Bonus. A character who fails his test suffers 1 level of Fatigue. It is quite possible for a character to march himself into unconsciousness. Fatigue gained from forced marching is removed at the rate of one level per two hours of rest.
### **Movement and the Environment

The movement rates for characters described in Structured Time Movement assume a relatively clear and uncluttered area. There may be a few encumbrances, puddles or wisps of fog, but characters can more or less move at their standard rates. However, the battlefields an Acolyte often finds himself in—narrow and twisting hive alleys, heaps of garbage in a recyk-yard, and muddy Grox pens—are less than ideal, and any number of obstacles could hinder a character's movement.

In such conditions, a character's Structured Time Movement Rate is halved. If a character runs or charges he must succeed at a **Ordinary (+10) Agility Test** or fall Prone. Of course, the difficulty of this Test can be further modified at the Game Master’s discretion based on any number of factors. See **Table: Treacherous Environments** below for some suggestions.
#### **Table: Treacherous Environments**

| Terrain Condition | Agility Test Difficulty |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Fog or Smoke      | Ordinary (+10)          |
| Mud               | Challenging (+0)        |
| Shallow Water     | Challenging (+0)        |
| Darkness          | Difficult (–10)         |
| Thick Snow        | Difficult (–10)         |
| Underbrush        | Difficult (–10)         |
| Dense Crowds      | Hard (–20)              |
| Zero Gravity      | Hard (–20)              |
| Rubble            | Hard (–20)              |
| Tremors           | Hard (–20)              |

## **Climbing

There are bound to be times when you want to climb over a wall, scale a cliff, or scramble up a tree to escape the claws of a vicious xenos. Clambering over a fence, scaling a city wall, descending into a crevasse, or climbing to an ideal sniper perch on a rooftop are all instances where climbing is required. Typically, climbing is divided into two general categories: **simple climbs** and **sheer surfaces**.
### **Simple Climbs**

Simple climbs include low walls, steep hills, tall piles of rubble, trees, or anything else that requires effort and concentration but no real skill to accomplish. Any character with his hands free can automatically accomplish a simple climb as long as he takes his time and isn’t being distracted (being shot at or buffeted by high winds, for example).

If a character is hurrying, being chased, under fire, or otherwise distracted, he needs to make a **Climb Test** to perform a simple climb. With success, the character completes his climb at a rate of one-half his Half Move speed (round up). For each further Degree of Success, the character climbs an additional metre. If the Test is failed, the character falls from his starting climbing position. A typical surface, such as one with a few handholds, should be **Challenging (+0)**, with the Game Master free to adjust the difficulty of the climb to account for any other factors that he deems appropriate. More frequent handholds, a corner to brace against, or a knotted rope would be easier, while unstable or slick surfaces or awkward angles would be harder.
### **Sheer Surfaces**

Many surfaces are beyond the means of ordinary characters to climb, and often require specialised training and equipment. A cliff with overhangs, a wall with no handholds, an icy crevasse, the walls of buildings, or the massive flying buttresses of a hive city are examples of such technical climbs.

Against such obstacles Climb is considered an Advanced Skill and cannot be attempted by characters who are not trained in it. With a successful Climb Test the character completes his climb at a rate of one-half his Half Move speed. For each further Degree of Success, the character climbs an additional metre. If the Test is failed, the character falls from his starting climbing position. Specialised tools such as grapnels and clip harnesses add bonuses to Climb Tests and should be strongly considered by anyone who anticipates attempting to navigate serious vertical obstacles.
### **Abseiling**

If you need to descend a sheer surface quickly (without throwing yourself off the edge) you can attempt to abseil instead of climbing down. Abseiling requires climbing gear, a drop harness, or at least a good, stout line, and requires you to make an **Acrobatics Test** or a **Difficult (–10) Climb Test.** If you have the good fortune of a sturdy ladder being available, you may abseil down the rails without any additional gear at a +20 bonus. 

With success you descend at a rate of 10 metres per Round, plus an additional metre for every Degree of Success. If the Test is failed, the rate is reduced to 5 metres per Round. However, if the Test is failed by two or more degrees, you must **Test Strength** or lose your grip. Unless you have a climbing harness or some other form of securement you fall.
## **Jumping and Leaping

A jump is a controlled vertical ascent or descent wherein you attempt to either jump as high as you can, or jump safely down from an elevated surface without taking Damage. If you are pushed from a ledge, lose your grip while climbing, or are otherwise not in control of your descent, you are Falling, not Jumping. 
#### Standing Vertical Jumps
From a standing position, an average character can jump about half a metre straight up (measured from the ground to the bottom of his feet). Jumping distance depends as much on a character’s body mass as it does his Strength and Agility, so this distance tends to vary only slightly between characters. A character can jump up to reach an overhead ledge, or similar object, that is as high as his own height, plus about one metre for average arm length, plus another half a metre for an average standing jump. Usually, no test is required to make such a jump, though pulling oneself up onto a grabbed ledge requires a **Challenging (+0) Strength Test**.

A character can attempt to safely jump down a number of metres equal to his Agility Bonus by making a **Challenging (+0) Agility Test**. If he succeeds, he lands on his feet and takes no damage. If he succeeds, but the jump is a greater distance than his Agility Bonus, he takes Falling Damage  equal to the distance jumped in metres beyond his Agility Bonus and ends his Turn Prone. If he fails the Agility Test, he suffers Falling Damage for the entire distance of the jump and ends his Turn prone.
#### Running Vertical Jumps
If a character gets a running start by moving at least four metres in a straight line, he can jump higher. At the end of his movement, he must make a **Challenging (+0) Agility Test**. If he succeeds, he can add half his Strength Bonus (rounded up) in metres to his normal vertical jump distance (see above), plus an additional half metre for each degree of success. If he fails the test, he stumbles, which ends his Turn. For every four additional metres beyond the first four that a character runs before making a Jump, he receives a +10 bonus to his Agility Test, up to a maximum of +30.
#### Standing Horizontal Leaps
To make a Standing Horizontal Leap, a character must make a **Difficult (–10) Agility Test**. On a success, he leaps a number of metres equal to his Strength Bonus, plus another half metre for each degree of success. On a failure, he only Leaps a number of metres equal to half his Strength Bonus (round up), and each degree of failure further reduces this distance by another half metre (to a minimum of one-half metre).

The height attained while leaping is equal to one quarter the distance in metres travelled (round up).
#### Running Horizontal Leaps
When performing a Running Horizontal Leap, a character must move at least four metres in a straight line before making the Leap. At the end of his movement, he makes a **Challenging (+0) Agility Test**. On a success, he Leaps number of metres equal to his Strength Bonus, plus another half metre for each degree of success. On a failure, he only Leaps a number of metres equal to half his Strength Bonus (round up), and each degree of failure further reduces this distance by another half metre (to a minimum of one-half metre). For every four additional metres beyond the first four that a character runs before making a Leap, he receives a +10 bonus to his Agility Test, up to a maximum of +30.

The height attained while leaping is equal to one quarter the distance in metres travelled (round up).
## **Swimming** 

The Swim Skill is used to swim and dive in bodies of water. You don't need to make a Swim Test under ideal circumstances, but hazardous conditions such as rough waters, hands being tied, or swimming whilst fighting all require Swim Tests to move. To swim under hazardous conditions, you must make a Swim Test as a Move Action. A success indicates that you move in any direction up to a number of metres equal to one-half your Strength Bonus, or simply tread water at your option. A failed Test means that you make no progress and cannot move. If you fail by 2 degrees or more, you sink one metre for every 20kg of your weight.

Characters that are unable to swim for some reason (unconsciousness, paralysis etc.) automatically sink one metre of depth for each 20kg of their weight on their Turn. Theoretically, a character could sink all the way to the bottom and walk their way out of the water if they can hold their breath long enough.

The Swim Skill assumes a character is attempting to swim in water, but on alien worlds a character might encounter unusual substances such as lakes of sulphuric acid. The Difficulty of the Test might be increased to represent particular conditions. Swim does not protect a character from harm when swimming in toxic or otherwise dangerous liquids, nor does it negate the need for protective clothing.
### **Swimming and Narrative Time**

Prolonged swimming, no matter the circumstances, is exhausting and potentially dangerous. A character can swim for a number of hours equal to his Toughness Bonus. After that point, he must make an additional **Toughness Test** each hour with a cumulative –10 penalty per hour. If a character fails his Toughness Test he suffers a level of Fatigue. If a swimming character falls unconscious due to Fatigue, he immediately slips beneath the surface and begins to Suffocate. To determine distance covered for each hour of swimming, use **Table: Narrative Time Movement** above and swap the character’s Strength Bonus for his Agility Bonus.
# **Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Objects**

*"The mortal burden carried dutifully to its destination is the Emperor's greatest praise."* 
— *Lexconicum Moralis.*

The amount of weight a character can move is derived from the sum of your character's Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus. Compare the total to **Table: Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing** to find out the limits of your might. Note that certain Traits and Talents along with specialised equipment may increase these values.
#### **Table: Carrying, Lifting & Pushing**

| SB + TB | Carry Weight | Lift Weight | Push Weight |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0       | 0.9kg        | 2.25kg      | 4.5kg       |
| 1       | 2.25kg       | 4.5kg       | 9kg         |
| 2       | 4.5kg        | 9kg         | 18kg        |
| 3       | 9kg          | 18kg        | 36kg        |
| 4       | 18kg         | 36kg        | 72kg        |
| 5       | 27kg         | 54kg        | 108kg       |
| 6       | 36kg         | 72kg        | 144kg       |
| 7       | 45kg         | 90kg        | 180kg       |
| 8       | 56kg         | 112kg       | 225kg       |
| 9       | 67kg         | 135kg       | 270kg       |
| 10      | 78kg         | 157kg       | 315kg       |
| 11      | 90kg         | 180kg       | 360kg       |
| 12      | 112kg        | 225kg       | 450kg       |
| 13      | 225kg        | 450kg       | 900kg       |
| 14      | 337kg        | 675kg       | 1,350kg     |
| 15      | 450kg        | 900kg       | 1,800kg     |
| 16      | 675kg        | 1,350kg     | 2,700kg     |
| 17      | 900kg        | 1,800kg     | 3,600kg     |
| 18      | 1,350kg      | 2,700kg     | 5,400kg     |
| 19      | 1,800kg      | 3,600kg     | 7,200kg     |
| 20      | 2,250kg      | 4,500kg     | 9,000kg     |

#### **Carrying Weight**

Your Carrying Weight is how much you can comfortably carry without suffering Fatigue or any penalties to your Movement. If you carry more than this weight you are Encumbered.
#### **Lifting Weight**

Your Lifting Weight represents the maximum amount of weight you can pick up off the ground. You may attempt to move while holding a heavy load, but if that load exceeds your Carry Weight you are Encumbered. Lifting a heavy load is a Full Action. You can attempt to lift more than your limit by making a **Strength Test**. With success, and for every additional degree of success achieved on this Test, you gain +1 to the sum of your Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining limits. If you instead gain two or more degrees of failure, you immediately suffer one level of Fatigue from overexertion or a strained muscle.
#### **Pushing Weight**

Pushing Weight is the maximum amount of weight you can push across a smooth surface, like a ship’s corridor or the polished stone floor of a temple. Difficult terrain can make pushing objects much more challenging or even impossible. Pushing an object is treated as a Full Action, and pushing weight up to your limit requires no Test. You may push weight that exceeds the sum of your Toughness Bonus and Strength Bonus by making a **Strength Test**. With success, and for every additional degree of success achieved on this Test, you gain +1 to the sum of your Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining limits. If you instead gain two or more degrees of failure, you immediately suffer one level of Fatigue from overexertion or a strained muscle.
#### **Encumbered Characters**

If you find yourself carrying more than your normal Carrying limit, but less than your Lifting limit, you are Encumbered. You take a –10 penalty to all movement-related Tests, such as Acrobatics or Dodge, and reduce your Agility Bonus by 1 for the purposes of determining Movement rates. In addition, after a number of hours equal to your Toughness Bonus have passed while Encumbered you must successfully make a Toughness Test or gain one level of Fatigue.
#### **Throwing Objects

There are many weapons, such as frag grenades and spears, that are designed to be thrown. These are indicated with a Range in their descriptions, and attacks with them are resolved with a Ballistic Skill Test like any other weapon. However, circumstances may demand you to throw something else, such as a backpack, a personal cogitator, or a baby Grox.

You can throw any object whose weight is equal to or less than half of your Lifting Weight. To see how far the object travels, make a **Strength Test**. A successful Test means that the object flies a number of metres equal to your Strength Bonus. For each degree of success, this distance increases by a factor of 1, so one degree means that you throw the object a number of metres equal to twice your Strength Bonus, two degrees means that the object is thrown a number of metres equal to your three times your Strength Bonus, and so on. If you are throwing a fairly light or aerodynamic object the GM may rule that the object can fly further than this—if you put a good spin on it, a data-slate will likely sail through the air much more adroitly than a Munitorum standard 20-litre fuel can. 

On a failed Test, the object falls short, flying a number of metres equal to half your Strength Bonus (round down). An unmodified result of 96 to 00 means you simply drop the object at your feet. If the object hits a hard surface, such as a wall or vehicle, it takes 1d10+SB Damage plus 1 for every degree of success on your Test.

If you want to throw an object at a specific target or point of aim, instead of merely in a general direction, you must also make a Ballistic Skill Test. With success, you strike your target or point of aim. If your Test fails, the thrown object lands within 1d5 metres of the target (assuming this is within the maximum range you can throw as determined by your Strength Test) in a random direction.

Should the need arise you can attempt to throw a heavier object that weighs no more than your Lifting Weight, but you must pass a **Hard (–20) Strength Test** to do so, with failure indicating you drop it at your feet. Even if you succeed it only travels half as far, i.e. up to half your Strength Bonus plus another half per degree of success.
# **Lighting**

*"If you dare to defy these dark times, enter."*

— Ordos Hereticus Maxim.

Characters in ***Dark Heresy*** are liable to find themselves moving under the cover of night, in the shadowy depths of caves, or in the dank and foetid underhive just as often as on the broad, splendidly lit promenades and sunny open spaces. As a result, the oppressive darkness becomes a constant enemy, concealing monstrous terrors and murderous foes in its inky depths. An experienced Acolyte knows, then, that a reliable and portable light source can be every bit as important as a trusted weapon and his faith in the God-Emperor.

For ease of play, ***Dark Heresy*** uses three levels of light: **Bright**, **Shadow**, and **Darkness**. 

* **Bright light** is any light that allows normal vision, such as sunlight or being within the radius of a torch, glo-lantern, luminen-pack, and so on. 
* **Shadow** occurs whenever a condition of low light exists, such as during the pre-dawn or twilight hours of a Terra-like world, when you are just out of range of a light source or using a fairly feeble one (such as a glowworm or a single candle), or when light sources are present but are heavily obscured by environmental conditions like smoke or dense fog. 
* **Darkness**, of course, is the near or total absence of light, such as a hive conduit whose lumo-tubes have burned out or being out under a moonless night sky.

Aside from obscuring vision, **Shadow** and **Darkness** conditions also have a deleterious effect on a
character’s movement and combat capabilities. Characters may move through Shadow with no penalties, but may only move at half speed or less in Darkness. A character moving faster than half speed in darkness has a tendency to wander, and may become disoriented and move in random directions unless they succeed on a **Hard (–20) Perception Test**. For the effects of lighting on combat, see **Darkness** and **Fog, Mist, Shadow, or Smoke**.
# **Flying**

*"It is my belief that foreign travel narrows the mind wonderfully."* — Helem Boesch, Ordo Xenos.

If you happen to possess a jump pack, the power of magnetic levitation, or have persuaded a flying creature to carry you aloft, the fundamentals of flying in ***Dark Heresy*** are described here.
## **Altitude**

On a typical Terra-like planet there are three broad Altitudes for the purposes of flying movement and combat: **Hovering**, **Low Altitude**, and **High Altitude**. Note that these are abstractions intended for use with **personal movement**—soaring through the air at High Altitude with a glidewing has likely no relevance to a Marauder bomber cruising at ten thousand metres above the ground.
#### **Hovering**

A hovering character or creature is skimming just above the ground, typically at an altitude of no greater than two metres, and can move over low obstacles effortlessly. A hovering creature can both attack and be attacked by land-bound creatures and characters. Depending on the character or creature's height relative to its opponents it may gain the benefits of **Higher Ground**.

A creature with the **Hoverer** Trait always stays at roughly the same altitude relative to the ground, give or take two metres, even if it descends into low terrain like a crater or valley. Such creatures typically will not willingly descend into a place that they cannot escape from, much like any other creature would not enter an area from which it couldn’t escape.
#### **Low Altitude**

This altitude indicates that you are flying beyond the reach of melee attacks but no more than a few hundred metres off the ground. You cannot attack or be attacked in melee, but depending on your approximate distance ranged attacks and Psychic Powers may still be possible. You take no penalties for shooting downwards, but those firing up at you suffer –10 penalty to their Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack you in addition to the normal penalties for range.
#### **High Altitude**

When flying at this altitude, you are flying far above the ground, anywhere from hundreds to several thousand metres up. Characters or creatures at High Altitude can only attack or be attacked by others at the same altitude.
## **Flying Movement**

Flying characters and creatures are broken into two general categories based on whether they have the **Hoverer Trait** or the **Flyer Trait**—these are duplicated below for brevity.

While flying, a creature must devote a Movement Action to maintaining its flight each Turn or it begins falling. A creature may fly with a Half Move, Full Move, Charge, or Run Action, using the number of the creature's Flyer or Hoverer Trait for the purposes of determining how many metres it can move. 

If a hovering creature suddenly stops flying, for example due to being Stunned, rendered Unconscious, or just not making a Move Action, it simply comes to a safe landing on the ground. A flying creature begins falling. Assuming the creature is on a Terra-like world, it falls about 40 metres as a Half Action, 170 metres as a Full Action, and about 350 metres for every subsequent Round it falls. If the creature hasn't arrested its fall before hitting the ground it suffers Falling Damage equivalent to how far it fell (which will almost certainly be instantly fatal if the creature fell from High Altitude).

The GM should feel free to adjust these values up or down based on pertinent conditions—a creature will fall slower on a planet with a dense atmosphere, and fall faster on a planet with higher gravity. Likewise, the great wings of a skyray will likely slow its falling speed (and therefore any potential Falling Damage) to significantly less than a human with a jump pack that's malfunctioned at an extremely unfortunate moment.
#### Trait: Flyer (X)
A creature with this trait has the natural ability to fly, whether with great feathered or leathery wings, strange warp energies, or inflatable gas sacs. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when flying. This number replaces the creature’s Agility Bonus for the purposes of calculating Movement.
#### Trait: Hoverer (X)
Creatures with this trait have a limited capability for flight, flying no higher than two metres off the ground. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when hovering. This number replaces the creature's Agility Bonus for purposes of calculating Movement.
## **The Effects of Gravity**

The great majority of the inhabited worlds of the Imperium only vary slightly in terms of gravity compared to that of Holy Terra, the birthplace of mankind. The exact gravitational pull of a given planet being a few percentages higher or lower will have minimal—primarily narrative—effects on game play. If the Acolytes are unfortunate enough to find themselves on a world with **significantly** higher or lower gravity, see below for various factors that must be taken into account.
### **Low Gravity Worlds**

On worlds with Low Gravity, all characters increase their Agility Bonus by 2 for the purposes of determining Movement and Initiative. In addition, characters add 4 to the total of their Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining carrying, lifting and pushing limits. When attempting to throw an object, a character on a Low Gravity considers his Strength Bonus to be 2 higher than normal. Finally, all jumping and leaping distances are doubled when on a Low Gravity world.
### **High Gravity Worlds**

On worlds with High Gravity, all characters decrease their Agility Bonus by 2 (to a minimum of 1) for the purposes of determining Movement and Initiative. In addition, characters subtract 4 (to a minimum 0) from the total of their Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus for the purpose of determining carrying, lifting and pushing limits. Characters also subtract 2 from their Strength Bonus (to a minimum of 0) for determining how far they can throw objects. Finally, all Jumping and Leaping distances are halved when on a High Gravity world.
### **Zero Gravity**

An Acolyte will almost certainly only encounter Zero Gravity while in the void, either due to being outside a voidcraft, or much more likely inside one whose grav-plating has failed. Zero Gravity is considered Difficult Terrain for determining Movement, and making a Charge or Run Action requires a **Hard (–20) Agility Test** to avoid drifting off in a random direction. Characters who fail the Agility Test are considered Prone. Additionally, a character starting a Move Action in Zero Gravity must be adjacent to a floor, wall, ceiling, deck, or other secure object so that he has something to push off from.
