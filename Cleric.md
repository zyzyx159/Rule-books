*"By the Saints and the Sigillite himself! If you don't move, I'll take this hammer to your head!"*

— Preacher Silon Constantine, Fenksworld.

The Adeptus Ministorum, or Ecclesiarchy, tends to the religious needs of the Imperium. It is completely separate from the Adeptus Terra, concerned with looking after mankind's spiritual needs rather than maintaining a galaxy-spanning empire. Nevertheless, the Ecclesiarchy is a vast and powerful institution comprising of millions of clergymen and hundreds of thousands of dioceses spread across the far reaches of Imperial space. In the past this has led the Ecclesiarchy into abuses of power and outright civil war, such as the Age of Apostasy. Yet the Ministorum endures, guiding humanity in its superstitious and dogmatic worship of the Emperor.

At the forefront of this vast church are the clerics, preachers, confessors and missionaries. Unlike the cardinals and pontifex that scurry around the ancient corridors of the great cathedrals of Ancient Terra and Ophelia IV, the spiritual homes of the Ecclesiarchy, the clerics and other such clergy live and work amongst the population. It is here that they preach the word, spread the faith and shepherd the human race, for if they were negligent in such duties Chaos would take hold.

Clerics are fiery individuals, who l ead from t he front. They are charismatic men and great orators, able to incite and inspire common folk with their speeches, commanding loyalty, respect and wonder in the Emperor and His ordained servants. On many occasions the Imperium has used such men to rouse populations to action at a critical moment of a foul xenos invasion or to flush out a deep-rooted Chaos cult.

A Cleric has many skills, he is an orator, can hold his own in combat and is wise. However, such a broad base of skills means that they rarely specialise. Still, there are those within the Ministorum that follow a path long after others have moved on to learn a new lesson. This breeds such diverse clergy from overly suspicious zealots, who see heresy around every corner and stir up entire populations to burn innocents on a burning pyre, to those who will steep themselves in ancient lore, spending years in great dusty catacombs studying ageing scrolls on pointless intricacies of ceremonies and rituals.

Despite many attempts by numerous Ecclesiarchs, the Ministorium has gained many disparate groups and ideals. Although all have the common theme of worshiping Him-On-Earth, it is in the details of how to pursue that faith where such disagreements and inconsistencies arise. Over the years, this has spawned numerous different orders within the Ecclesiarchy; the majority of clerics belong to one of the different orders and this has a profound effect on how the clergyman performs his duties and preaches to the masses. Although never acknowledged publicly, it has been rumoured that occasionally these orders have gone to war with each other, though open bloodshed is rare.

Inquisitors find Clerics useful Acolytes as their abilities to interact with, and influence, the local population have proved valuable on many occasions. From a Cleric's point of view his reasons for shunning the duties of the Ministorum and becoming an agent of the Inquisition can be manifold. Some see it as a form of penance; others view Inquisitors with awe and unthinkingly follow these most worthy of the Emperor's servants; the more zealous see service with an Inquisitor as a way of fighting heretics up close, the chance to purge the galaxy of foul deviants too much of an opportunity to ignore.

#### **Novice Advances**

*"Do you think Saint Thrastus complained when he was strung up by his petard? No! Not one word! That's piety. Now get on with your work, you little ingrate."*

Novices serve the Ecclesiar chy body and soul, looking to the examples of the Impe rial saints to inspire acts of greatness. They also serve those higher than them selves in the Ecclesiarchy (which is quite a few people indeed).

# **Initiate Advances**

*"Even the lowly initiate may become a martyr, if his will be strong enough."*

Initiates are instructed to defend the Cult of the Emperor with more than simple words, so that the Emperor's light may be brought to the ignorant and truculent.

*"You hold within you the Emperor's own truth! Never forget we are right and they are wrong!"*

A Preacher learns to lead men, to inspire and guide mankind, and to drive the word of the Ecclesiarchy home—upon the teeth of an eviscerator if need be.
