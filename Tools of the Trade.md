# Gear

Aside from weapons and armor, a host of other equipment exists that may be of some use to the enterprising Acolyte in his service to the Emperor. Many situations can be resolved with a quick strike and a fast bullet, but there are numerous others that may require significantly more tact, and a specialized set of equipment to go with it. This sort of arsenal falls under the general classification of Gear, and includes clothing, special tools, drugs, and many other bits of kit that range from the mundane and ubiquitous to the rare and esoteric.
## Acquiring Gear 
### Availability

Having the money does not always guarantee the desired goods or services are at hand. Squalid medieval worlds are a lot less likely to have expensive goods than the marketplaces of a hive city. Moreover, finding a high-quality weapon on a backwater planet is far more difficult than locating such a weapon in a teeming metropolis. To reflect availability, each piece of equipment or service has an associated Availability, ranging from abundant to very rare. GMs can use the following guidelines as a starting point for determining whether a place has such an item or not. Characters searching for a particular item or service must make a successful Inquiry Test modified by the Availability of the item, Availability: Difficulty by Population provides a baseline modifier for Inquiry Tests to find an item in communities of different sizes. Influence talents, such as Peer and Good Reputation, can grant a bonus to Inquiry Tests when going through relevant parties, such as Middle Classes and Workers on a hive world or Adeptus Mechanicus on a forge world. In general, larger communities tend to have greater access to rarer and more valuable items due to the nature of trade and mercantilism in the Imperium.

### Time

Just because a large community actually has the item a character seeks does not necessarily mean that it is easy to locate. The larger the community, the more time it takes to track the item down. A community's size determines the base time it takes to find the item. Each degree of success reduces this time by a certain amount (minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months, depending on the base time). See _Dark Heresy_, Table 5-5: Availability and Time on page 126. The GM should make the roll in secret for particularly dangerous or costly items, to emphasis the struggle and possible risks entailed by such searching.

| Availability: Population and Time |                        |                  |                 |               |                 |

### Craftsmanship

Not all goods are of the same quality. In the vastness of the Imperium, and beyond, the craftsmanship of items can vary widely from crudely made, mass-produced materials to handcrafted masterpieces.

Normally, Craftsmanship has little effect on game play for regular goods and services. As a general rule items of Poor Craftsmanship are more prone to failure and breaking while Good and Best Craftsmanship are more durable, though it is up to the GM how and when these effects might enter play. Some gear, goods, or services may have markedly different effects or qualities depending on their Craftsmanship - in such cases, the effect will be listed in the item's description. The GM may reduce the Difficulty of certain tests, but it is entirely at his discretion. Unless specifically stated, the Craftsmanship of any object is considered Common.

| Craftsmanship Cost Multiplier Availability |      |                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------------- |
| Best                                       | ×10  | Drop 2 steps    |
| Good                                       | ×3   | Drop 1 step     |
| Common                                     | ×1   | —               |
| Poor                                       | ×1/2 | Increase 1 step |
## Clothing & Personal Items

This category covers a wide array of gear designed for everyday purposes or other common tasks, though a resourceful Acolyte should be able to find plenty of less conventional uses as well. In general, items in this category are meant to be worn; handheld pieces are described in the Tools section. More generic items are listed first, with those endemic to certain worlds, regions, or purposes to follow.

† _This item's Craftsmanship has one or more special effects_

### Backpack

Variously referred to as rucksacks, kit bags, or gear sacks, a backpack refers to any piece of equipment generally worn over the back or shoulder via straps that is intended to carry other items. Backpacks come in countless permutations throughout the Calixis Sector, and may take the form of rigid framed packs of plastek and synth-canvas to completely soft and supple leather bags with button closures. A backpack can generally hold about fifty kilograms worth of gear, allowing the wearer to carry or drop a load of equipment at will, although particularly long or over sized items will likely stick out of one or both ends.

### Blast Goggles

This bulky eye wear is specifically designed for protective purposes, most commonly taking the form of large, single lens pieces that are strapped to the back of the wearer's head. The heavy glass steel lens is durable enough to deflect or mitigate flying bits of shrapnel, making them popular items for those who fight at close quarters, and also includes a reactive laminate coating that darkens in response to bright flashes of light. Aside from combat applications, blast goggles are also common attire for forge workers, furnace crews, and arc torch operators. They can also be found in use by gangers who value the intimidating look as well as the degree of concealment offered by the hefty pieces.

A character wearing blast goggles is immune to the blinding effects of a photon flash grenade and similar sources of extremely bright light, though the character suffers a -10 penalty to sight-based Awareness tests for 1d5 Rounds as the laminated lens returns to its normal transparency. Additionally, should the character ever be subjected to a non-Energy Critical Damage effect that would cause him to lose one or both eyes, the goggles save his eyesight but are torn away and ruined in the process.

### Cameleoline Cloak

Cameleoline is a term used to describe materials made from a miraculous and poorly understood mimic fiber that mysteriously alters its coloration to blend in with its immediate surroundings. While distracting to look at directly, cameleoline cloaks are indispensable gear choices for scouts, snipers, and anyone else who values stealthy approaches to an objective. They are ill-suited for everyday wear, however, as the constantly changing appearance will likely attract suspicious and confused stares in crowded areas.

A character wearing a cameleoline cloak gains a +20 bonus to Concealment tests. Further, if they remain stationary, the passive camouflaging effect causes them to be counted as being at Extreme Range (see Combat Circumstances on page 198 of _Dark Heresy_) when attacked by a ranged weapon.

### Charm

A charm is a keepsake, holy relic, or some other good luck token that is intended to draw the benevolent eye of the Emperor to the wearer. They take a myriad of forms, including such things as saintly finger bones, fragments of blessed bolt casings, water from holy rivers or cisterns, or even corpse hair woven into significant patterns. An almost universally superstitious society (and rightly so), many citizens of the Imperium place great faith in their charms, and there are no shortage of all types of peddlers, vendors, and (unfortunately) charlatans who will happily arm faithful Acolytes with a charm to safeguard them in their endeavors. Of course, discerning a true relic from a fraudulent one can be a troublesome or even impossible task; as a result, the cost and weight of a charm is entirely up to the GM.

Wearing a charm has no immediately tangible benefits. However, when in the course of an adventure something unfortunate is about to occur to a random character, the GM may choose to shift the unpleasant effect away from a character wearing a charm. If all the characters are wearing charms (as any faithful servant of the Emperor should), it is up to the GM which, if any, charms are the most potent.

### Chrono

Short for chronometer, these items are generally worn on the wrist or carried in a pocket and can keep the bearer up to date on the current time, though how accurate the readings are depends on the craftsmanship of the item as well as the consistency of the wearer in ensuring that the chrono is set correctly. Most units use a mechanical set of hands on a dial, but more expensive units could make use of electrically powered digits instead, and particularly extravagant examples might have a powered hololith that projects the time into the air above the wearer's arm.

### Clip/Drop Harness

An absolutely invaluable item for those who must often deal with vertical obstacles, clip or drop harnesses (as they are variously known) are strapped to the wearer's torso and thighs, allowing them to make use of a securely attached spool of safety line with a magnetic or hooked clasp. When properly attached to a suitable point, the wearer of a clip or drop harness can safely scale or descend from almost any surface, although especially treacherous ones may still prove dangerous.

A character wearing a clip or drop harness gains a +30 bonus to Climb Tests and cannot fall if he fails, though a particularly serious failure might result in him becoming tangled up in his harness' line. A character can descend a vertical surface normally, but ascending with a clip harness is somewhat slower than trusting one's bare hands alone as the attachment points must be continually moved as the wearer ascends. An ascending character moves at one-half their Half Move speed, regardless of how many degrees of success they may have on their Climb Test.

### Clothing

Protecting one's modesty pleases the Emperor, and there is a whole universe of different styles of clothing worn by Imperial citizens in the Calixis Sector alone. Whether humble rags, sturdy coveralls, or elegant robes and vestments, clothing is often the quickest way to identify someone's station or role, and Acolytes wishing to investigate a given area would do well to familiarize themselves with the local fashions and who wears what. Attempting a comprehensive list of Imperial attire would be a fool's errand, but some more common pieces are listed here.

**Rag-Castings (Poor Craftsmanship):** Very poor and drudging citizens often must make do with patchwork clothes made from whatever materials are readily available. Outfits made in this way are reasonably durable but have an extremely shabby appearance, often with the effect of making the wearer resemble a pile of refuse or garbage.

**Adept Robes (Common Craftsmanship):** Whether members of the Administratum or their counterparts in major conglomerations and dynastic enterprises, adepts are famous for the near ubiquity of the clean-cut robes they wear. While made of simple materials, adept robes are well made and feature over sized cuffs, generous belts and pants, and usually include a hood that is worn in public. Coloration and trim are widely varied, but only Administratum thralls are allowed to be dyed in red.

**Coveralls (Common Craftsmanship):** Workers of all types often don large single-piece garments that are comfortable to move around in during long shifts. They are especially common in manufactorums, where different colors or coded arm bands can indicate workers from different areas, shift supervisors, and product inspectors. Many Imperial citizens who labor in these environments will often exclusively wear clothing of this type, even during leisure hours, and refectories and holotheatres populated by coverall-clad patrons are a sure sign that a manufactorum and its hab blocks are nearby.

**Hiver Overcoat (Common Craftsmanship):** Those who reside in the Imperium's sprawling hive cities often gird themselves in long, sturdy coats or cloaks when travelling on foot, typically to provide protection from cold, rain, or sudden bursts of vapor from poorly-marked vents. Clothing of this type is typically drab in color; blacks are usually less popular than grays and earthy tones due to their common association with plainclothes enforcers.

**Uniform (Common Craftsmanship):** Worn typically by soldiers, enforcers, and private militiamen, a uniform helps identify the wearer as belonging to a certain faction, and may include rank tabs, awards and decorations, heraldic symbols, and any other suitably impressive accessories. Uniforms run a range of styles and cuts, and may be specifically be worn under personal armor.

**Bodyglove (Good Craftsmanship):** This type of form-fitting outfit is worn like a glove for the entire body as its name would imply, and is a common choice for skilled operatives, bodyguards, and infiltrators. A bodyglove may be a simple rubberized suit that stretches to fit its wearer or could be as sophisticated as a custom fitted piece with integral cooling coils, but in all cases they are designed to be easy to move in with the absolute minimum encumbrance.

**Ecclesiastical Robes (Good Craftsmanship):** Flowing habits that are equal parts intimidating and inspiring, the vestments donned by ecclesiarchs of all ranks are finely-made clothing that tends to become progressively more ostentatious and elaborate as the clergy ascend in rank and power. At the minimum, an ecclesiastical robe will include the primary robe itself with a separate belt or sash, a mantellum worn around the shoulders and a mitre or biretta on the head. Ecclesiarchs-in-attendance will typically wear slippers, while those in the field may don any sort of applicable footwear (boots are the most common choice).

**Mechanicus Robes (Good Craftsmanship):** The infamous red robes of the Martian Tech-Priests are voluminous and heavy garments that conceal most of the adherent's augmetics, including separate sleeves and cowls to keep their bodies completely covered even while blessing the innards of a needy machine. Mechanicus robes most frequently feature a checkerboard pattern trim and numerous skull-and-cog insignia, and are often riddled with concealed slits and pockets so the wearer's augmetics can manoeuvre about freely. A common saying goes that no outsiders have ever seen a Tech-Priest's cyber-mantle and the most impressive of their assimilation with the machine spirit – this is both a statement on the Mechanicus' extremely secretive nature as well a literal observation on their concealing garb.

**Aether-Weave (Best Craftsmanship):** A popular fashion among well-connected hive nobles, aether-weave is formed from luminescent fabrics that can be made to glow in different colors, allowing the wearer to have a custom-made set of attire that diffuses light about their bodies or creates elaborate designs and patterns with tiny lumen beads. The exact shades and diffusion of light that an aether-weave creates can be manipulated or adjusted by re-stitching, but most who can afford such fineries usually just buy another set.

**Billow Robes (Best Craftsmanship):** Billow robes are exquisite clothing designed for those who care more about appearances than function. The costly lighter-than-air fabrics are difficult to tailor but can create a marvelous look as the robes flow and wave around the wearer, often making them appear significantly larger than they actually are. Though certainly impressive to look at, billow robes can be difficult to move in, and the wearer must be mindful not to trip over an errant trailing flap.

### Dog Tags

A somewhat pejorative name for common types of military identification, dog tags are typically made of sheet metal in a small rectangle or circle into which is stamped or punched-out information about the wearer. What is inscribed depends on the branch of service, but typically includes the wearer's name, date of enlistment or conscription, blood type, and place of origin. Dog tags are usually surrendered when (or if) the wearer is released from service, but some veterans choose to keep wearing them in honor of their unit or as a personal charm or memento.

### Field Sack

Military backpacks or rucksacks are typically designed to very specific patterns for ease of mass production as well as to carry standard field kits, and will often include straps and pockets explicitly for carrying canteens, cleaning kits, entrenching tools, and attaching a bedroll. However, field sacks are less useful than "civilian" backpacks as far as carrying unusual objects (personal cogitators, grox bridles, arcane staves, and so forth) is concerned. Additionally, most field sacks are designed to be able to be fully unfolded into a makeshift body bag should the wearer meet a violent end in his service to the Emperor.

### Filtration Plugs

Filtration plugs are simple but exceedingly useful items that are inserted into the wearer's nostrils. The expansive foam or fabric material fills the orifices, helping to ward off dangerous vapours (as well as unpleasant odors). Filtration plugs are commonly employed by workers who deal with the more foul aspects of Imperial society, such as tanners, sump crews, morticians, and grox herders, but can also be used to protect against some chemical weapons in a pinch.

A character wearing filtration plugs gains a +20 bonus to any Toughness Test made to resist the effects of gases.

### Infrared Goggles

Commonly referred to as IR goggles, this piece of gear allows the wearer to look into the infrared spectrum and is most commonly used for identifying sources of heat. In industrial applications they can be crucial for determining points of failure or friction in machinery and piping, but they are also imminently useful for spotting hiding enemies at night, making them favored items among crack military troops and high-rent mercenaries.

A character wearing IR goggles can see in darkness without penalty and gains a +20 bonus to vision-based Perception Tests in such situations, though very hot environments and thermally shielded enemies may counteract this or give the wearer "false positive" readings.

### Photo-Visor

Photo-visors use complex electrically-powered filtration lenses to amplify ambient light, allowing the wearer to see in the dark almost as well as in perfectly well-lit areas. As a result, they are almost always a popular and sought-after gear choice for all matters of men who must operate at night or in darkness, and have been donned by assassins and bodyguards, enforcers and reclamators, commandos and infiltrators, and innumerable others.

Good Craftsmanship photo-visors can employ more sophisticated filtration systems to shield the wearer from exceptionally bright light, rendering them immune to the blinding effects of photon flash grenades and similar devices.

Photo-Contacts: These superior pieces of gear utilize the same equipment as photo-visors but in a much more compact profile, granting similar effects to the wearer but in the form of unobtrusive contact lenses.

### Re-Breather

Re-breathers make use of a self-contained air supply piped in to a helmet or mask, allowing the wearer to exist in extremely toxic environments or even to function underwater; they are highly in demand items among reclamators and other scavenger types who frequently operate in conditions that would fell an unprotected man in short order. Compared to military gas masks or civil respirators, a re-breather offers almost perfect protection but is only as good as the remaining air in its canister.

While worn, a re-breather makes the wearer completely immune to the effects of most gases or inhaled toxins and can safely swim or dive underwater without risk of drowning. Re-breathers make use of disposable air canisters that last for about an hour before they must be replaced, which takes a Full Action and may expose the wearer to anything unpleasant that the re-breather was previously protecting them against. Spare canisters cost 25 Thrones, weigh half a kilogram, and are Scarce.

### Recoil Glove

Interlocking plates connected by bundles of memory wire enable these curious-looking gloves to form a rigid strut around the wearer's hand and forearm, allowing for much more efficient dissipation of recoil forces when shooting guns. More costly versions may be able to conceal their functioning parts somewhat better, but regardless of their make or pattern, a recoil glove is a sure sign that the wearer is a serious gunfighter.

Characters wearing a recoil glove can fire a Basic weapon with only the gloved hand and do not take the usual -20 penalty for firing one handed. Likewise, Pistol-class weapons that usually require two hands to be fired (such as hand cannons) can be fired one-handed by a recoil glove as well.

### Respirator/Gas Mask

Gear of this type is intended to protect the wearer from harmful gases and vapors by passing the air the wearer breathes through several filters in succession. Respirators generally cover the wearer's mouth and nose and are nominally "civilian" items, while gas masks fully cover the face or head and have a distinctly "military" appearance, although there is some overlap between the different types and as with many pieces of kit they are manufactured in a bewildering array of patterns in the Calixis Sector alone. Regardless of the exact method and style, they are far superior protective wear compared to the more common filtration plugs, and in some particularly grim areas of hive cities are just about everyday wear.

A character wearing a gas mask or respirator receives a +30 bonus to any Toughness Tests made to resist the effects of airborne gases and may re-roll a failed Test; the results of the re-roll are final.

### Spider Pads

Spider pads are a type of superior climbing apparatus that are worn on the hands, arms, knees and feet. At the wearer's direction, these unusual-looking pads can emit an adhesive substance that greatly improves the wearer's ability to climb sheer surfaces, giving them spider-like mobility where others would be struggling to find purchase. Care must be taken to ensure that the spider pads themselves remain inactive when the wearer isn't climbing lest they find themselves sticking to floors, walls and held objects, and most only don these items when about to begin a climb.

A character wearing spider pads gains a +30 bonus to Climb Tests when attempting to climb most regular surfaces. Loose and unstable surfaces, such as scree or talus, reduce this bonus to +10.

### Survival Suit

Often found in the kits of explorers as well as within the lockers of better-stocked life pods, survival suits are a boon to anyone who must endure a harsh environment. Bulky by design, a survival suit is designed to be worn over normal clothing and even some body armors, providing an insinuative barrier between the wearer and outside temperatures. This is most effective at keeping the wearer from freezing to death in frigid climates, but a heat exchanging vane system is used to drive a series of power cells to keep the wearer from overheating in scorching temperatures as well. By nature of their design, survival suits are uncomfortable to wear in normal temperature ranges, with the wearer typically being either too hot or too cold thanks to the suit's aggressive construction.

A character wearing a survival suit gains a +20 bonus to Survival Tests where resisting the effects of a harsh climate are concerned, though he still must be able to provide for food and water using other means.

### Thermal Gloves

These thin yet sturdy gauntlets are made of high-quality materials and inlaid with complex circuitry that can keep the wearer's hands comfortably warm or cool without the need for bulky insulation that would hamper manual dexterity. "Active" gloves of this type were first developed for use in the mining colonies on Soryth, where the frozen gas deposits must be extracted and handled carefully lest their impact-sensitive nature lead to a catastrophic explosion – a task whose difficulty is magnified by hands numbed by cold or trapped in bulky mittens. Small thermal batteries produce power for the gloves in order to maintain their temperature-regulating qualities – these cells are meant to be kept under the wearer's clothing where they can absorb heat from the body, with a thin cable connection keeping the gloves supplied with power.

A character wearing thermal gloves can safely handle hot or cold objects without taking Damage, although their protective qualities are not impervious to especially extreme temperatures (such as an operating reactor head or an overheating plasma gun). Further, the wearer can also jerry-rig the power source to provide a jolt of electricity that can be used to help restart a stalled generator, power-up a data slate with a dead power cell, and so forth. Using a pair of thermal gloves in this way grants the user a +10 bonus to Tech-Use Tests when attempting to work with unpowered machinery or gear. Finally, the wearer can totally discharge the gloves' cells to part-recharge a las weapon, adding 1d10+1 shots worth of charge to a standard charge pack or 1d5-1 to a hellgun capacitor. Thermal gloves can only be used with packs for basic and pistol-class las weapons – heavy weapons' power packs are simply too large for the gloves' cells to have any meaningful effect. Once depleted, the thermal gloves' cells recharge on their own in about an hour as long as they're kept in contact with a warm body.

### Void Suit

Exposure to hard void, even briefly, is almost invariably lethal to humans. Void suits remedy this problem by creating a pressurized shell around the wearer, allowing them to exist safely in the void for a period of time. Once sealed, a void suit creates a micro-environment that totally insulates the wearer from gases, immersion in fluids, or the life-draining effects of the void itself, and typically includes a rebreather to provide the wearer with a fresh air supply. Void suits are made in many patterns and can range from fairly simple pressurized fabric to sturdy articulated plasteks and composite materials. Most will also include some common tools useful for doing work in the void, such as tether lines, mag-clamps, and so forth. Other features generally depend on the Craftsmanship of the suit itself.

Poor: While still perfectly capable of protecting the wearer against depressurisation and toxic atmospheres, crude or cheaply made void suits cannot change their re-breather canisters while the suit is being worn, limiting the wearer's deployment to as long as his canister holds out. They are also typically not shielded against radiation and other aetheric energies, which can lead to sickness or death over long-term exposure.

Good: Void suits that are manufactured to a higher level of quality usually include a waste recycling system and better air scrubbers for longer void deployments. A single re-breather canister lasts twice as long in a Good Craftsmanship void suit, and magboots are almost always included as a standard accessory.

Best: A voidsman's best friend, these void suits fit well and are minimally encumbering despite having full-spectrum shielding and insulation. A double cartridge system allows the wearer to switch re-breather canisters with the flip of a button for a maximum of four hours of operations without replacing a canister, and a built-in impellor on the back grants the wearer extra mobility in a zero-gravity environment (treated as having a Movement of 6).

### Specialty Personal Items

Whether only found on certain worlds or serving extremely specific purposes, items in this category fall outside the purview of clothing and equipment encountered by the vast majority of the Imperium's citizens, including most trained agents. Acolytes may encounter various examples of specialty equipment while on mission on worlds where this gear can be commonly found, for a particular purpose during the course of an operation, or just out of happenstance while conducting field work.

### Fedrid Braid Cloak

Fedrid's dense, nearly impenetrable jungles are home to innumerable horrors, but the most dangerous creatures on this feral world are its native huntsmen who take to the trees in search of terrifying creatures to stalk. The feral hunters often clad themselves in braid cloaks, tough leathery garments made from the Ungorth hides, which are thought to ward off the scything talons and reaping fangs of the nightmares that lurk below the jungle canopy. While this is more superstition than anything else, the cloaks do offer some protection, but more importantly are excellent camouflage. Fedrid's Ungorth survives by remaining unseen, and its hide has excellent scent-masking properties even long after the creature's death.

A Fedrid braid cloak grants a +5 bonus to the wearer's Concealment Tests in any environment thanks to its ability to mask the wearer's scent. When worn in a jungle environment similar to Fedrid's own, however, the wearer can seemingly vanish into the native fauna; the bonus increases to +20. Finally, the tough construction adds 1 AP (Primitive) to the wearer's Arms and Body.

### Explosive Collar

A staple of the Imperial Guard's penal legions, explosive collars are an easy and just about uniformly effective method of ensuring compliance on the prisoners they're attached to. Each collar includes a hard-wired microvox receiver linked to a remote, whose holder can either release the collar or cause it to detonate. An explosive collar being triggered is almost assuredly lethal to the wearer; the residual blast deals 1d10 points of Explosive Damage to characters and objects within 3 meters of the victim. An explosive collar can be triggered up to a kilometer away – removing it from the remote's effective radius may or may not cause an automatic detonation.

Less common versions sometimes used on penal worlds or in work gangs eschew the remote detonator in favor of a fixed limiter link that triggers a detonation if the collar strays too far from a defined boundary or distance, typically with an audible warning advising the wearer to return within the prescribed boundaries.

### Gill Filter

This strange rubbery mask adheres to the bottom half of the wearer's face, covering their nose and mouth with a wet, clammy layer of biomass. Despite its appearance being more akin to a vaguely shaped wad of goo, a gill filter is actually an extremely sophisticated piece of gear developed by a cadre of Magos Biologis conducting research on the water world of Spectoris. The strange membranes act like the gills of marine creatures, filtering oxygen out of water which the wearer then respires normally.

The exact means by which these miraculous items are manufactured remains a mystery; there are no shortage of rumours, however, with some nefarious suggestions involving hideous deep sea creatures and cloned human flesh making the rounds through public houses and dives frequented by workers and explorers who use the filters for prolonged submarine endeavours.

A gill filter will sustain a submerged wearer's need for air indefinitely. However, the filters must be kept constantly immersed in water - if exposed to air for more than about a minute the filter will dry out and wither, becoming a useless piece of brittle detritus. Gill filters are typically stored in a watertight metallic container when not in use.

### Gloom Eye

"Gloom Eye" is a common term for strange hunks of luminescent crystal that can be inexplicably found in the depths of many hive cities in the Calixis Sector. The strange mixtures of polluted wastes that drip down from the upper levels and congeal in hardened masses can sometimes form lumps of gloom eye. Finding a growth of gloom eye is considered a sign of providence or good luck by reclamators and others making expeditions into the underhive, and those that live within the fetid depths swear that carrying a piece of gloom eye offers blessed protection from the perils of the crumbling and claustrophobic pits. Gloom eye from the nightmare hive of Volg on Fenksworld is particularly sought after - according to some, the stuff changes colors when the wearer is in imminent danger.

A piece of gloom eye sheds light like a candle and counts as a charm for any wearer. Characters from hive worlds gain a further +10 bonus on tests made to avoid Pinning. Volgite gloom eye, which costs three times as much and has an Availability of Very Rare, allows the wearer to act as if he had the Paranoia Talent. In all cases, the piece must be worn in an obvious location on the wearer's body - covering or hiding its light halts the gloom eye's effects.

### Holo-Visor

A holo-visor is a specialized piece of gear designed for covert operations, and are most commonly employed by military types and assassins who rely on discrete tactics. A special back-scatter film causes the visor to detect specific intensities of light in the infrared spectrum. When paired with a special lens filter, a common red-dot laser sight projects a beam that is only visible on a holo-visor. This allows the wearer to target his enemies or indicate targets to other characters wearing their own holo-visors while those not so equipped will be none the wiser to the beams being "painted" on them. Due to the nature of the back-scatter film used in their construction, holo-visors are fairly bulky pieces of headgear, with Good Craftsmanship versions being solid enough to double as blast goggles.

### Huntsman's Musk

World-hopping big game hunters and feral beast trackers alike commonly make use of stench-laden pastes to mask their human odours when in pursuit of prey with an acute sense of smell. Smearing oneself with foulness whose origins are best left unconsidered is by no means a pleasant process, but this odoriferous task could well be the margin between a successful hunt and being torn to shreds by an agitated carnosaur. Among certain circles, the varied stinks of musk from different creatures on different worlds can take on an almost academic or artistic appreciation.

Creatures that rely on smell to detect their prey take a -20 penalty to Perception-based Tests made to detect characters wearing huntsman's musk. An application lasts for 2d5 hours. Depending on the method of application, being immersed in water or rain may shorten this duration. Huntsman's musk may also be able to foil pursuit by characters with the Heightened Sense (Smell) Talent as well.

### Jump Pack

Across the Imperium, and likely since the dawn of mankind, men have dreamed of flight. Jump packs are fantastic creations of the Mechanicus that allows just that. Using a combination of high-intensity suspensor cells and powerful hybrid thrusters, a character wearing a jump pack can send themselves soaring through the air or hurtling across flat ground at great speed. Jump packs are highly sophisticated pieces of equipment that require special training both to use and to maintain, and as a result they are typically only employed by elite organisations such as the Adepta Soroitas' famed Seraphim or the Imperial Navy's crack void armsmen. Much larger versions are used by Assault Marines of the Adeptus Astartes to especially devastating effect. Because of their bulk and mass, along with the noise of idling turbines, jump packs are typically only donned right before an operation commences.

Using a jump pack requires the operator have the Pilot (Jump Pack) or Pilot (Personal) skill to attempt to fly without understanding the nuances and habits of the jump pack would result in almost certain death. A trained character can use a jump pack to safely land from almost any altitude, and can make short jumps or dashes as if they had an Agility Bonus of 6 for the purposes of determining movement. When used in this mode, a character takes off at the start of his movement and lands at the end this can potentially allow a character to avoid difficult or hazardous terrain (see Treacherous Environments on page 213 of _Dark Heresy_). When cranked to maximum output, a jump pack allows its wearer to duplicate the effects of the Flyer (12) Trait for up to a minute at a time; after being used in this fashion, a jump pack must spend an equal amount of time cooling its turbines.

Jump packs can also be used in a void environment, granting the wearer a Movement of 15. Without atmosphere to rush through its turbines, a jump pack relies purely on its thrusters to move through void, which will exhaust their reserves of fuel and energy in about an hour.

### Mag-Harness

These sturdy belts and bandoliers contain a series of magnetic plates on the outer surfaces, allowing the wearer to attach ferromagnetic objects, such as knives, pistol clips, or whole grenades - simply by tapping them against the centre of each plate and allowing the magnetism to do the rest. A mag-harness allows a professional fighter to do away with many kinds of mundane holsters and pouches or packs - as long as the item is mostly composed of magnetic alloys, it simply sticks to a given plate and remains there until needed. Aside from simple tapping or twisting motions, a mag-harness' plates can be manually activated or deactivated by short numeric codes that are entered into a small runepad on the harness' large belt buckle. The pad is typically covered by a sturdy lid to prevent damage or errant hands grasping at it, and many mag-harnesses decorate it with the insignia of the maker, the organisation it belongs to, or a personal badge of some sort. Magharnesses usually aren't used in military situations due to their expense as well as the careful attentions one must keep while wearing one - an environment full of metallic objects, such as a hive corridor or the interior of a tank, could result in the wearer being stuck to a surface if his harness accidentally triggers. Likewise, areas with large amounts of electromagnetic interference can result in "undesirous operation", and heavy-duty magnets such as those often used in the moving of scrap metal and cargo-vaults can be especially dangerous. The Adeptus Arbites are the largest single user of mag-harnesses, as their welltrained patrols can be trusted to use the appropriate level of caution when around such hazardous conditions.

A mag-harness can attach up to 25 metallic objects that can be easily held in one hand wearing one grants the wearer the Quick Draw talent for any pistol, grenade, one-handed melee weapon, or similar item that can be attached to the mag-harness. Basic weapons and twohanded melee weapons can be attached to a mag-harness provided they weigh less than 10 kg, though they take the same amount of time to Ready as normal. If the character already possesses the Quick Draw talent the magharness does not let them Ready any faster, but they can stow items that would benefit from the talent as a Free Action. Some types of weapons are composed of nonmetallic materials or alloys that have no ferromagnetic qualities - these can't be used in conjunction with a mag-harness.

### Magboots

Standard gear for voidsmen conducting work on the exterior of ships or servicing areas where the grav-plates have malfunctioned. As the name suggests, magboots are sturdy, oversized shoes that are worn over a voidsuit and provide a solid magnetic attachment to most surfaces found within Imperial voidships. Though heavy and hard to move in, magboots are a necessity for any kind of reliable movement in a zero-gravity environment.

A character wearing active magboots has his Agility Bonus reduced by half, but can walk normally in areas of low gravity or zero gravity as long as there are ferrous surfaces available (such as deck plating). Magboots of Common or better Craftsmanship can be activated or deactivated as a Half Action with a simple stud - Poor Craftsmanship examples are always active.

### Night Cloak

Night cloaks are formed out of a type of insulative and lumen-dampening fabric more commonly seen in reactor or boiler isolating sleeves. Cloaks are the most common style of this uncommon gear, but rarer varieties might take the form of a stormcoat with a pull-on hood. Regardless of the construction, when fully donned a night cloak completely absorbs the wearer's ambient thermal energy while perfectly masking any light-emitting items that the wearer may possess, giving him an excellent stealth advantage at night or in other areas of darkness. Its thermally absorbing qualities can make a cloak uncomfortable or even downright dangerous to wear for a long period of time, something that well highlights its basis as a piece of industrial or naval hardware rather than purpose-designed stealth equipment. Night cloaks have only appeared in the Calixis Sector within the last decade, and exactly who manufacturers these highly specialized pieces of kit remains a mystery.

A character wearing a night cloak gains a +30 bonus to Concealment Tests when in areas of darkness, even if there is not applicable cover or terrain available, and enemies using infrared goggles gain no bonus to their Perception Tests against the wearer. Characters wearing night cloaks run the risk of overheating as their body temperature is forced higher and higher. Each hour, a character who is stationary must make a Routine (+20) Toughness Test, while a character engaging in activity (such as walking or climbing) must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. Strenuous activity, such as running or climbing, reduces the interval by half. In all cases, failure causes the wearer to gain a level of Fatigue.

### Ocular Catechizer

This arcane instrument is a favored tool of archivists, scriveners, sages, and Administratum officials who often work with voluminous bodies of text and handwritten documents. The intricate-looking devices, resembling ornate brass eyewear festooned with lenses and multifocal loupes, grand the wearer a potent ability to magnify and recognize patterns of information in written or visual materials. No mere set of bifocals, an ocular catechizer's machine spirit can literally help the wearer "read between the lines" and process data much more efficiently than with his own eyes and mind alone. That being the case, ocular catechizers have a reputation for particularly temperamental and easily-vexed machine spirits - if the wearer does not entirely focus on his task, the catechizer will often reward him with a severe headache and sore eyes.

A character wearing an ocular catechizer gains a +10 bonus to any Literacy, Logic, Lore, or Search Test when close examination of written text or visual data (such as picts or patternsheets) are involved. Only physical materials can be scanned through in this way - ocular catechizers are not designed to read text displayed on data-slates or pict-screens. An ocular catechizer may be wired to a data-slate, cogitator, or similar device in order to record its impressions for later study; this can also be used to grant the wearer a +20 bonus to Trade (Copyist) Tests made to transcribe bodies of text. No other Actions may be undertaken while a character is using an ocular catechizer in this way. Should the character fail one of the above Tests by four or more degrees the ocular catechizer inflicts 1 level of Fatigue on the wearer as it inadvertently sends a painful feedback loop into the wearer's head.

### Opus Machina

Many have seen an Opus Machina before but few know to call the skull-and-cog medallion worn around the neck of many Tech-Priests by its true name. Part tool, part devotional symbol, and part badge of office, an Opus Machina conceals just as many secrets as the red robes of its bearers. The interior of an Opus Machina is riddled with circuitry, power cells, and microcogitators, all of which gently broadcast code ciphers and ultrasonic prayers signifying the wearer's worth to those with the right ears to process them. Most tech-priests don't clutch and brandish their Opus Machina when hailing their cohorts as many outsiders would their Imperial Aquila. The uninformed would assume this is merely another facet of the Martian Priesthood's deliberate lack of empathy and faith in the God-Emperor, but the few who are well-versed in the secrets and mysteries of the Mechanicus know well that the mere presence of an Opus Machina communicates far more than any simple gesture possibly could.

Any character can wear an Opus Machina, though this is strongly frowned upon (and sometimes violently so) by non-members of the Adeptus Mechanicus. However, if the wearer has both the Speak Language (Techna-Lingua) and Common Lore (Machine Cult) skills, an Opus Machina's innate features can be activated. This grants the wearer a +10 bonus on all Fellowshipbased Tests when communicating with other Tech-Priests and followers of the Machine God, as well as a +10 bonus on Tech-Use Tests made to interact with servitors, cogitators, and other complex machines. Finally, an active Opus Machina's code ciphers and override decrypts can effectively replicate the effects of a multi-key when used on electronic locks, alarms, and when communing with machine spirits.

### Slip Vest

Slip vests are made of a faded yellowish leather obtained from the hides of savage beasts native to Monrass in the Drusus Marches. When properly tanned the leather never loses its waxy sheen and nearly frictionless texture, making it exceptionally supple and comfortable to wear. Aside from its fashionable appearance, the slippery surface of the aptly-named slip vest has the side effect of making it difficult to get hold of the wearer. Pugilists, thieves, and others with "irregular habits" who are in the know have come to appreciate these vests and their slick qualities - martial opponents, guards, and others who would try to tackle a wearer tend to have a much less positive opinion.

Characters wearing a slip vest gain a +10 bonus to any attempts to break free from a Grapple action, while Grappling opponents suffer a -10 penalty to attempt to start or maintain the Grapple. A slip vest's bonus may not apply in certain situations, such as a character being grabbed around the legs by the vines of a Death World carnivorous plant.

### Fedrid Soul Mask

These ornate wooden masks glare and scowl with sinister faces which the native hunters of Fedrid believe ward off evil spirits and frighten the savage beasts they stalk. Soaked in the blood of ritually slain monsters - or, as some have whispered, ritually slain enemies - the native huntsmen trust these masks to warn them of danger when the trapped soul within flinches in anticipation of imminent peril. Whether or not there is any truth to this superstition is an academic matter, but that has little bearing on the popularity of these masks as pieces of macabre art that decorate the private studies of collectors and other aficionados from Scintilla to Malfi. The stories of strange hauntings, bloody histories and native curses clinging to such masks only enhances the frisson of owning one, with particularly frightening-looking examples fetching a high price at auction.

### Targeting Monocle

For some, image is everything - both what it shows and what it conceals. For those who demand an ostentatious appearance while preserving a tactical advantage in the event of an eruption of combat, few items better typify this attitude than a targeting monocle. At first glance, this piece of gear simply looks like a wellcrafted monocular eyepiece, but the wearer is presented with a highly useful battery of information at all times, which may include thermal imaging, distance to the point of sight, ambient wind speed, and so forth. The exact utility of a targeting monocle depends on the desire of the commissioner. Many are outfitted with a miniature wire link or a short-range microvox allowing them to be used like a sight on a chosen gun.

When a targeting monocle is created it may duplicate the effects of any one weapon upgrade that is considered to be a sight, such as a Red-Dot Laser Sight, Motion Predictor, or Telescopic Sight. Determine the cost in Thrones by multiplying the price of the sight upgrade by ten. A unique receiver unit can be installed to a gun that is paired to the targeting monocle, allowing the wearer to use the sight and even take Aim Actions without actually drawing the paired gun. A successful Very Hard (-30) Scrutiny Test allows an opponent to see through the subterfuge and determine a targeting monocle's true purpose. The monocle's receiver unit does not count as a sight for the purposes of determining a gun's sight limit, but the wearer cannot benefit from using both the targeting monocle and a sight attached to the gun at once.

## Drugs & Consumables

Giving the incredible breadth and span of the Imperium of Man, it is no surprise that there are a staggering array of food, drink, intoxicants, drugs, and other items meant to be taken into the body. Some alter the consumer's mindset or perception, others can fulfill valuable medical needs, while many more simply sustain important biological functions. To attempt to codify a complete list of edibles and drinkables consumed within the God-Emperor's domain would be an impossible undertaking even for a battalion of expert lexmechanics, but some more common items that an Acolyte of the Calixian Conclave might find during the course of his duties are listed here. An appendix containing more specialized or region/world-specific consumables follows.

### BUILDING IMMUNITY

Some drugs, especially those that profoundly affect the user's physiology, can quickly cause the user to develop an immunity to their effects. If an Acolyte takes more than one dose of a drug that is subject to immunity within a 24 hour period he must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. Success indicates the drug has the desired effect, while failure causes the Acolyte's body to reject the substance. Subsequent use of the same drug during any 24 hour period forces a cumulative increase in the difficulty in the Toughness Test, regardless of whether or not the previous Test was a success (a third dose would force a Difficult (-10) Toughness Test, while a fourth would force a Hard (-20) Toughness Test, and so on).

### GETTING ADDICTED

While any stimulating or allaying substance could be potentially habit-forming, some are so compelling that their users cannot help but want more and will often go to great lengths to satiate their need. Those of strong will may withstand these temptations, at least for a time, but chronic use can erode and debase even the most stalwart of hearts and minds.

Even the most cloying or pernicious narcotics can usually be taken from time to time with minimal risk of becoming an addict. Especially addictive drugs will specify a certain number of doses which, if taken over a certain timeframe, can "hook" the user. The user must then make a Willpower Test, with failure indicating the user has become addicted to the drug in question.

An addict generally feels compelled to consume at least one dose of their drug per day; the addict can resist this urge with a successful Routine (+20) Willpower Test, although this Test has a cumulative -5 modifier for every dose of the drug the user has taken in the last week. Should the user succeed he can fight off his addiction for the day, but will now suffer a penalty specific to each drug as he goes through withdrawal. These withdrawal effects persist until the addict either gives in and doses up or successfully overcomes his addiction.

Overcoming addiction is deceptively simple: the addict need only avoid the drug in question for a length of time specified in the drug's description, after which it clears his system. This can be accomplished through the user's force of will alone or via physical separation from the drug (a specialized de-tox hospice or a precinct-fort's holding cell being equally effective). Once the requisite period of time has elapsed the user no longer suffers from withdrawal symptoms and can be considered "clean" again. However, recovered addicts can still slip back into the habit quite easily: if he begins using the same drug again in the future, any Willpower Tests to avoid becoming addicted once more suffer a -10 penalty.

### Amasec

This is a common term for a variety of alcoholic beverages distilled from wines and other fermented fruits - it enjoys an almost universal popularity across the Imperium's civilised worlds. The quality of this drink can vary widely - cheap bottles with watery pink or purple contents can be found in low-hive refectories and are affordably priced, while expensive and rare vintages with sealed corks pour like syrup with a rich, flavourful bouquet and are typically cracked open by toasting nobles at a soiree or Imperial Guard officers commemorating a strategic victory.

More common bottles of amasec may not force the imbiber to make a Carouse Test until two or three drinks have been taken, while the stout and storied vintages can be strongly fortified and may impose a -5 penalty on the imbiber's Tests to remain clearheaded.

### Attention Spanner (Drug)

Attention Spanner is an unusual substance that is commonly consumed by hard-working adepts and archivists that require a high degree of focus over long periods of time, though it is also more rarely used by artists, writers, tradesmen, and more fleshy members of the Adepts Mechanicus. A dose of attention spanner takes the form of a fine powder contained in a digestible capsule. Once absorbed by the body, attention spanner induces a state of monomania in the subject, giving them an abnormal level of focus and dedication to resolving the current task. Care must be taken when using attention spanner, however, as the consumer can sometimes find himself zeroing in on something other than his intended task and wasting time until the drug wears off. Outside of certain circles the use of this drug is extremely rare.

Attention spanner takes effect after about 20 minutes if swallowed. The consumer can also chose to break open the capsule and inhale its contents, in which case the drug becomes effective in 1d5 Rounds. The consumer must pass an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test if the capsule was swallowed or a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test if inhaled for the drug to function properly. If successful, the consumer gains a +30 bonus to any Intelligence-based Tests for the next 1d5+3 hours, but also suffers a -20 penalty to any Perception-based Tests due to his fixation on the subjects at hand. Should the consumer fail his Willpower Test, the drug still takes effect, but the consumer runs the risk of being too distracted to actually focus on his tasks. The consumer must make a Challenging (+0) Perception Test (including the drug's penalty) every 30 minutes until the drug wears off. Success indicates that the consumer was able to concentrate on his work and suffers no further ill effects. Failure, meanwhile, has him become distracted by any sort of diversion available, causing him to take a -20 penalty on all Tests until he succeeds on a subsequent Perception Test or the drug's effects expire.

### Calmer (Drug)

These sedative capsules are thought of as being the purview of voidsick pilgrims and shellshocked Guardsmen, but anyone suffering from the after-effects of severe trauma can benefit from their soothing effect. Therapeutic in nature, calmers can be especially helpful in preventing a mental breakdown or psychotic episode in those that have had horrifying experiences, such as witnessing a hive blackout, being trapped in a manufactorum fire, or encountering a ravenous beast that's crawled up from the underhive - even members of the Inquisition have taken up the habit of suppressing unpleasant encounters, though few would admit it. Calmers are affordably priced but are still beyond the reach of especially poor and destitute citizens who must try and make due with their personal hauntings, sometimes with very unfortunate effects.

A dose of calmers takes about 20 minutes before it becomes effective. Once ingested, calmers impose a -20 penalty to the character's Perception and a -5 penalty to their Initiative (minimum 1) for 1d10+5 hours due to the drug's highly allaying qualities. The character may ignore the effects of any Minor mental disorders during this time. Further, if the character is suffering from any Mental Traumas, reduce the result on Table 6-8: Mental Traumas by 30 for the duration of the drug's effect.

### Combat Ration Pack

A variety of Munitorum-approved rations are produced in vast quantities by agri-worlds throughout the Imperium to create a steady supply of food for soldiers of the Imperial Guard as well as mobilized PDF regiments and other military-style outfits. A combat ration pack typically takes the form of a metallic pouch that can be stuffed into a backpack or cargo pocket (such as are commonly found on infantry fatigues) which is hermetically sealed and waterproof - each contains a mixture of preserved foodstuffs that can sustain one man for a day. Common items include a variety of synth-crackers and cakes, tubes or cans of spreadable protein, and condensed soup blocks designed to be dumped into hot water. Because of their heavily processed and synthesized nature a ration pack's contents are typically bland or have a half-hearted attempt at flavour, and it is common for deployed Guardsmen to try and scrounge up anything available to make the rations more palatable. Ration packs will also contain smaller but equally useful sundries, including vitamin supplements, water purification tabs, salt, and antiseptic gum (to prevent tooth decay). Officially known as "readyto-eat" meals, some types of ration packs have derisively been referred to as "refusing to exit" by their consumers as they tend to cause constipation with extended use. While nominally intended for use in military operations, combat ration packs can often be found for sale in goods stores and by other second-hand peddlers for use by travellers, reclamators, explorers, and anyone else who needs storable food that can also be transported easily. Many of these packs are beyond their marked expiration date, but the food inside never seems to actually go bad.

#### Long Duration Ration Pack

This variety of ration is intended for use by troops that must march long distances as well as scout and commando teams as it contains a correspondingly higher caloric content. Highly condensed protein bars replace some of the spreadable pastes, while the soldier is expected to spike his canteens with packets of carb powder that also contain a variety of stimulants. These additions do little to improve the taste of the ration, but their nutritional benefits are sorely appreciated by soldiers who would go hung

ry using standard packs, and the amount of food energy in proportion to the mass of the ration itself is incredibly good.

#### Emergency Ration Pack

Both durable and storable to a point, emergency rations are intended not to be consumed except in a serious situation and are typically stored away within compartments in flyers, wastes-trawling macro haulers, and combat vehicles. Emergency rations typically contain dehydrated and highly compacted cubes of starch, fat, meat or vegetable extracts, synth-stock, and so forth. Should a crash survivor or lost traveller require their aid, the rations are intended to be broken up into hot water to form a soup or broth, which can sustain the consumer for quite a while - assuming they have a source of water available, of course. Most emergency rations also contain purification tabs for this purpose, though this may be of little aid to a marooned party in an arid desert.

### De-Tox (Drug)

De-Tox is the common term for a biologically reactive compound that is intended for emergency use in saving the life of a poisoned or overdosed victim. Packaged in a small disposable injector unit, de-tox causes the consumer to violently wretch and cough, expelling whatever might currently be inhabiting their stomach, lungs, and bowels as well. The experience is singularly unpleasant, but is certainly preferable (in the eyes of most, anyway) to a painful death from tainted food, drug overdose, or noxious fumes. De-tox is effective at stopping common forms of toxins as well as the life-threatening effects of drug overdoses or alcohol poisoning, but likely will not be enough to save a victim who has inhaled a militarized chemical weapon or been hit by a needle rifle's deadly payload.

A dose of de-tox ends the ongoing effects of any drugs and most other ingested substances one Round after it has been administered. The character is Stunned for 2d5 Rounds as the detox forces his body to purge out the harmful contents (among other things). A conscious character can attempt to resist this effect and reduce the duration by a number of Rounds equal to his Toughness Bonus, but if this produces a result of zero or less then the character also resists the beneficial effects of the de-tox as well!

### Fonodstuffs

Barring a few exceptions, one thing all men have in common is a necessity to eat. The types of food consumed throughout the Imperium are heavily dependent on both the type of world and the individual's social class, with those having greater income having access to the best eats. Drudging labourers and manufactorum workers in the low hives typically subside off of heavily processed and synthesized food which may or may not actually resemble anything edible corpse starch, cultured algae, parboiled fungus, protein pastes, and so forth. Adepts, domestic workers, traders, and others who ply their labours in the mid-hive might subside off of flavoured Grox strips and fortified slurry-drinks, while the nobles in the spires above have access to the finest cultivated grazer meat, purified mineral water, and fleshy rehydrated vegetables. Paradoxically, those plebian labourers who toil away on agri-worlds tend to have access to some of the freshest fare, as the produce and meat has yet to reach the monstrous processing plants that renders it into goods that will survive the trip to nearby worlds.

### Frenzon (Drug)

Unquestionably the top tier of combat drugs, frenzon sends the consumer into a violent rage, making him a fanatical and fearless warrior who seeks only the destruction of his enemies. It is commonly used in military situations, especially among penal legions, where it has an infamous reputation due to the use of remote-controlled autoinjectors meant to "motivate" the dour legionnaires. Other users include high-rent mercenaries, bloodspot fighters, and ganger heavies that want to "feel the rush" while smashing some victim's head against the rockcrete. Frenzon is always used with an injector so as to provide immediate results.

A character using frenzon enters into a rage one Round later as if he had the Frenzy talent, gaining all the benefits and penalties associated with being frenzied. This effect lasts for 1d5+5 minutes and may not be voluntarily ended by the consumer short of using de-tox or some similar effect.

#### Cold Fire

Sometimes known as "noble's frenzon", this more costly drug is laced with antipsychotics and tranquilizers that help balance out some of the less desirable effects of frenzon. The much shorter duration makes it suitable for duellists and participants of combat sports, but any user who happens to be in a fight could benefit from the better control that cold fire offers.

This drug duplicates the primary effects of frenzon, but the effect lasts 3d10 Rounds, and the character also gains the benefits of the Battle Rage Talent as well.

#### Ghostfire Pollen Extract

Ghostfire pollen, native to the feudal world Iocanthus, is used as the main ingredient of frenzon in the Calixis Sector. The drug is produced through a variety of distillation and moderating procedures - the pollen itself is a fairly small portion of the final product. However, exceptionally motivated - or irrational - warriors have been known to inject pure pollen extract directly, which sends them into a frothing berserker state that makes a user of "common" frenzon look mildly disgruntled in comparison. The use of ghostfire pollen is strictly forbidden in the Imperial Guard and most planetary militias as it is considered far too great of a risk to the user - which, considering the dangers of a battlefield, should be a suitable warning as to its capabilities.

A character who uses ghostfire pollen extract immediately falls under its effects, gaining all the benefits and penalties of the Frenzy talent along with the Unnatural Strength (x2) and Unnatural Agility (x2) traits. However, the user also takes 1 point of Damage (which ignores Armour and Toughness) due to system shock as the pollen takes over and the user begins to sweat blood. Should the user kill all enemies before the drug's effect wears off he must then attack any nearby characters or creatures, possibly including his allies. In absence of any other potential character or creature to attack the frenzied character must then assault any nearby objects (trees, rocks, walls, and so forth) until the drug's effects wear off. A dose of ghostfire pollen lasts for 2d10+5 minutes. If the character spends more than 10 minutes under the effects of ghostfire pollen, he must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test once it wears off or gain a level of Fatigue as massive overexertion takes its toll.


### Halo (Drug)

This drug induces a mild state of psychosis in the user - the effects are similar to a highly diluted dose of frenzon, though the stuff takes far longer to break down once in the bloodstream. Most believe that halo was originally developed for use in penal legions of the Imperial Guard, but its use is surprisingly widespread among a variety of worlds and social classes - the only constant is that the user desires a bit of fortification against a particularly unpleasant stimulus. A character under the effects of halo finds long vertical drops, narrow passages full of skittering vermin, enemy bunkers, and possibly even ominous stacks of paper- and slatework to be somewhat less frightening than before, though this suppression of natural repulsive emotions does tend to make the user somewhat less alert as a result.

A dose of halo becomes effective in about 20 minutes once ingested. It can also be used in an injector instead, in which case the effects begin after one minute. The drug remains active for 2d5 hours, during which time the user gains a +10 bonus on all Tests to resist Fear and Pinning, but also suffers a -10 penalty on Perception-based Tests as a result of their newlyfound self-confidence.

### Kick (Drug)

Kick is the common name for a variety of drugs that give the user a sharp burst of shortlived energy. Though not nearly as potent as slaught or most types of stimms there are also fairly few consequences to its use besides a profound feeling of tiredness once the drug wears off. Unlike many drugs, kick includes a biological "warning" to the user when its effects are about to expire. When the user begins to see unusual colors around the edges of their vision he knows that he'll soon be plunged into profound listlessness and lethargy. Kick is commonly used in military situations where an urgent manoeuvre must be executed no matter what condition the troops are in, but it can also be found in the pockets of warring hive-gangers and enforcer kill teams who believe a little extra "kick" might be the margin of victory. Kick's low cost and ease of manufacture makes it available to just about anyone who can find a seller, though it typically has few users outside of those who make their living through violence.

A dose of kick becomes effective one Round after it is injected and remains active for 1d5+10 Rounds. During this time the user can completely ignore the effects of any Fatigue he already has as well as additional levels he may gain while the drug is effective. Once the drug wears off the user falls back under the effects of any accumulated Fatigue he already has plus an additional two levels, which may be enough to render him unconscious. If the user had no Fatigue when he injected kick, he instead gains 1d5 levels when it wears off. A character who has used kick is aware that the drug will wear off one Round before it actually does.

### Lho-Sticks

This popular narcotic is typically sold in packs and can be found just about anywhere within the Imperium, though some xeno-arcanists have suggested that even the lesser races of the galaxy make use of similar substances. Lho-sticks are formed from a thin paper that is rolled into a tube and filled with dried and crushed leaves from a variety of plants (referred to as a whole as "lho" in Administratum regulations) that produce a mildly relaxing and satisfying sensation when smoked. The lho smoke has some addictive qualities, and heavy users tend to develop a dependency on it after long term consumption. Lho-sticks sometimes incorporate a small foam filter to enhance the flavour and smoothness by reducing the amount of irritating particulates in the smoke. Regardless of their construction, lho-sticks are generally considered a recreational item on most worlds and their use is sometimes even encouraged among teeming masses of menials, labourers, low-hivers and enforcers as their sale typically brings in a few demi-Thrones to the planetary coffers. There are some worlds which strictly regulate or outright ban the consumption or sale of lho-sticks, however, as more than a few pilgrims and explorers have found out the hard way. Guardsmen tend to be especially heavy consumers, and their use is so common in the Imperial Guard that the Departmento Munitorum has even distributed their own brand (where it is inexplicably listed as a ration).

Smoking a lho-stick puts the user in a mildly relaxed state for about an hour. Normally this is insufficient to have a meaningful in-game effect – at the GM's discretion, lighting up a lho might grant a bonus in certain situations.

Lho-stick smoking is addictive, but getting hooked usually takes several months of regular use. A character is more likely to enter play already addicted to lho-sticks, or the GM may adjudicate a smoking character becoming addicted over the course of a campaign. Once addicted, the user suffers a -5 penalty to Agility and Fellowship-based Skill Tests on any day in which he hasn't smoked at least 1d5 lho-sticks. It takes two weeks of abstinence for a character to overcome a lho-stick addiction.

### Obscura (Drug)

Though almost universally proscribed and the subject of enforcer crackdowns, this drug is nearly as widespread as it is potent. Obscura induces a peaceful dream-like state in the user that can last anywhere from a few hours to all day depending on the purity of the substance, but tends to leave the user feeling deeply depressed or despondent once the drug wears off. Whether this is a chemical reaction of the drug itself or simply the user suffering from being returned to reality is a subject of fierce debate. Obscura comes in a variety of forms, all of which have strongly addictive qualities. The crystallized powder is typically smoked or inhaled into the nostrils, but users wanting a more intense effect will often use organic acids to distil the powder into a condensed liquid and inject it directly into the bloodstream. Though relatively inexpensive to manufacture, the "street price" tends to have a massive mark-up due to its illegality. The producers, smugglers, and dealers who supply the stuff can make a very comfortable living off of their addicted clients, though the risk of an enforcer - or worse, Arbitrator - kill team kicking down the door is a constant companion.

A dose of obscura sends the user into a euphoric trance filled with pleasant visions; cut obscura lasts for 1d5 hours, while the pure drug lasts for an additional 5 hours. While under its effects the character suffers a -20 penalty to any Perception, Intelligence, or Willpower-based Tests, but is also considered to have the Fearless talent as they are unable to actually rationalise danger or peril. Once the drug wears off the user suffers a -10 penalty to his Willpower and Toughness for the next 1d10 hours as he goes through a general malaise unless another dose of obscura is taken. Using de-tox will end the primary effects of obscura but cannot nullify its secondary consequences.

A character who takes three or more doses of cut obscura in a week long period must pass a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test or become addicted; if using pure obscura, the Test becomes Hard (-20) instead. Once addicted, the user starts each day with one level of Fatigue that can only be removed by taking a dose. It takes three weeks of abstinence to overcome an obscura addiction.

### Ploin Juice

Juice from the ploin fruit, which grows like a weed on some worlds in the Calixis Sector, is an almost ubiquitous drink for voidfarers and explorers as the oddly-shaped fruit itself never seems to become rotten. Though mild in flavour, ploin juice contains a variety of minerals and vitamins that are often sorely lacking in cheap shipboard rations. That it combats common void illnesses while also possessing an extreme longevity is viewed as something of a miracle by seasoned void-masters and ratings alike, and many discharged crewmen have often settled for good near starports and shipyards simply so they have ready access to more of the stuff. "Flatlanders" who choose to try ploin juice are often baffled as to its nearly religious appeal among voidfarers as it is something of an acquired taste.

### Recaf

Recaf is a popular hot beverage that exists in many permutations throughout the Imperium the only universal constant is that is tends to contain a mild stimulant such as caffeine or pharamoxine. Crushed and cured leaves from certain plants are the most common variety, but baked or roasted seeds ground into powder and brewed can be found on most worlds as well. Varying grades of recaf exist and virtually all levels of Imperial society take part in it, whether from simple tin mugs or elegant ceramic cups.

### Rotgut

This catch-all term covers a broad array of cheap brewed or malted alcoholic drinks commonly consumed by labourers, soldiers, and other members of the lower classes of Imperial society, though only a few ironic brands would actually describe their product as such. Most rotgut tends to be produced in vast quantities by the same megaguilds and agri-trusts that supply the Calixis Sector's hive worlds with processed foodstuffs - pilgrims and travellers can often take a small amount of solace when stepping onto a new world that the same drink they've had on their homeworld will likely be available at their present destination. A minority come from smaller brew-plants and houses which are often endemic to a single world or region, some of which is surprisingly tolerable. Though considered something of a social blunder, a few labels are even enjoyed by Malfian hive nobles, and the trend is beginning to appear within exclusive circles on Scintilla as well.

### Slaught (Drug)

Short for "onslaught", this drug powerfully affects the consumer's nervous and respiratory system, making them both physically and mentally faster. Slaught is most commonly used in military situations where a final push or fierce attack is about to be launched - troops under its effect can cross enemy kill zones and other types of "no man's land" much quicker, giving them a better chance of making it to their objective and unleashing the Emperor's fury upon the enemy. Extended use of slaught can badly overtax the consumer's vital humours and innards, often resulting in nerve damage or growth of tumours. Most commanders will not issue it regularly for this reason, although depending on the conflict, a Guardsman could well have much bigger things to worry about than possible long-term consequences. Its use outside of the Imperial Guard and other armed forces is fairly rare. Slaught can be ingested or injected directly into the bloodstream - injecting it results in more immediate effect but tends to have worse side effects once the drug runs its course.

Slaught takes one minute to become effective after being ingested. If injected instead the drug takes only one Round to take effect. Regardless of how it is taken, a dose of slaught increases the user's Agility and Perception by +30 for 3d10 Rounds, during which time the user feels extraordinarily jumpy and restless if he isn't engaged in some type of physical activity. Once the drug wears off the user must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer a level of Fatigue as his body catches up with the drug's effects and leaves him exhausted. If the character injected slaught the difficulty of the Test becomes Difficult (-10) with failure inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. Failure by three or more degrees also reduces the user's Agility by 1d5 points - if the user injected slaught, this Characteristic Damage is permanent.

### Spook (Drug)

Spook is an incredibly unusual drug that fills the user with strange visions of heightened perception, ultimate power, or some other such delusion. However, this is no mere hallucination - spook actually enables the user to manifest a limited form of psychic energy, which can be extremely useful (or extremely dangerous...) in the right situation. Spook is derived from rare mutagenic substances that can sometimes be found naturally amassing in the lowest depths of Imperial hive cities. These sickly-looking greenish puddles, typically sprouting luminescent fungi, contain a vast concentration of human protein - likely the result of waste and effluent from above as well as the decaying remains of underhivers, mutants, and even more unspeakable things congealing together. It is thought that the presence of this human genetic material in such a condensed form is what causes the drug's psy-reactive effect, but the exact method of action remains a mystery. Regardless of how the stuff comes to be, it is an incredibly feared and reviled substance that is almost universally proscribed across the breadth of the Imperium. The enforcer crackdowns that target the makers and distributors of spook more closely resemble military offensives than ganger busts, which all but ensures a high price for the drug - and a veritable fortune to be made for those with the guile and conniving to partake in its trade. Only a few, however, are cunning or lucky enough to outlive their ill-gotten wealth.

Spook takes effect immediately as soon as it touches the user's lips, and has markedly different effects based on whether a character has a Psy Rating or not. A user without a Psy Rating must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test - failure indicates that the drug is unable to find the user's "psychic mind" and simply bestows terrible, nightmarish visions instead, inflicting 1d5 Insanity Points in the process. Should the character succeed he gains a random psychic power (see Table 5-15 on page 149 of _Dark Heresy_). If the character succeeds by two or more degrees, the character may instead simply gain a single minor psychic power of his choice. The character has access to the power for a number of hours equal to his Willpower Bonus and manifests it by succeeding on another Willpower Test.

If the user happens to be a psyker - in other words, has a Psy Rating - they must also make a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test as they take the dose. Success adds 2 to all Power Rolls for a number of hours equal to the psyker's Willpower Bonus, while failure causes the psyker to gain a single Insanity Point as they are subjected to some of the same horrible sights that the nonpsyker would. Regardless of success or failure, add +20 to any rolls made on the Psychic Phenomena table; this secondary effect lasts until the drug runs its course, even if the psyker failed his Willpower Test.

### Spur (Drug)

This drug is most commonly used by unsavoury types who earn their keep through violence. It is highly unusual in its method of action in that the initial effect is delayed - the strong stimulants and proteins remain inert in the user's bloodstream until they are activated by adrenaline, at which time the user is hit by an abrupt rush of energy and vigour. Because of these qualities, a user can "dose up" in anticipation of a fight, saving them from fumbling with an injector or skin patch while a foe is drawing weapons. A spur user can endure almost any pain or injury, fighting through wounds or exhaustion that would leave an unassisted man on the ground wheezing for mercy. Twitchy, paranoid, and shockingly difficult to subdue short of a shotgun blast to the head, spur addicts are especially despised by most enforcers.

A dose of spur takes one Round to become active, but it does not actually take effect until the user becomes engaged in combat. Spur can remain in the user's body for up to 10 hours - if the user does not engage in combat during this time the drug dissipates and another dose must be taken in order to gain its effects. Once a character enters into combat (rolls Initiative or Surprises an enemy) the drug becomes effective for 2d10 minutes. A character under the effect of spur cannot be Stunned or take any levels of Fatigue while the drug is effective. Once the effect ends the user suffers a -20 penalty to any Toughness- or Agility-based Tests for one hour. The user also gains one level of Fatigue for every two levels that he ignored due to taking spur (if the character ignored one level of Fatigue then he takes none when the spur wears off).

Taking more than four doses of spur in a weeklong period can cause addiction - the character must succeed on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test to fight it off. A spur addict suffers from deranged paranoia, compulsively dosing up every day out of fear that he will be caught in a battle without it. On any day in which the addict doesn't take a dose he gains a +10 bonus to Perception-based Tests, but also reduces his Intelligence, Willpower, and Fellowship Characteristics by 10; additionally, if another character or creature startles or surprises the withdrawing addict he must make an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test. With success, the addict may act normally – failure causes him to either reflexively attack whatever startled him, or treat it as though it had a Fear Rating of 3 for the next 1d5 rounds (addict's choice). It takes three weeks of abstinence to overcome a spur addiction.

### Stimm (Drug)

Stimm is a generic term for a voluminous amount of fast-acting drugs that are meant to suppress pain and invigorate the user, allowing him to fight on (or flee faster...) in spite of terrible wounds or crushing exhaustion. Stimm is most commonly encountered in military situations, but anyone who fights for a living would be well served to have a stimm or two on their person, and they are an integral part of any field medikit. A stimm's effect is short-lived, but being able to move when a victim would ordinarily be consigned to a slow death on the ground has no doubt spared innumerable souls from an early reunion with the God-Emperor.

Stimm takes effect immediately and lasts for 3d10 Rounds. During this time the user cannot be Stunned or knocked unconscious and ignores the negative effects of Fatigue. Should the character have suffered Critical Damage, a dose of stimm allows him to ignore any negative effects to his physical Characteristics, though broken and lost limbs or blinded eyes are still just as useless.

### Tranq

An unusual type of booze to say the least, this brew (if it can be called as such) is indigenous to the low hives of worlds in the Golgenna Reach, but press-ganged ratings and hard-nosed security proctors aboard voidships have spread it throughout the Calixis Sector. The exact method of preparation varies from recipe to recipe, but all involve a variety of chemical distillates being mixed and prepared into a drink that produces a feeling of numbing relaxation which lasts for hours. This tranquilising effect, which begets the stuff's name, is a welcome escape for many who eek out a paltry existence doing drudging work, though those who are used to the drunkenness that amasec or rotgut creates have referred to tranq's own inebriation as being remarkably depressing. The flavour varies widely depending on its individual constitution, with a few being regarded as "not disagreeable".

### Truth Serum (Drug)

Often regarded as an indispensible tool by enforcer cadres, Arbitrators, and even agents of the Holy Ordos, truth serums are a wide array of drugs and draughts that are designed to make a subject more compliant to questioning and inquiry. Most types of truth serum will typically work by depressing the resistive areas of the user's mind, loosening their grip on things that they might ordinarily be very inclined to keep private. Though very effective at making the mind more docile, truth serum can also cause the user to ramble and divulge all kinds of information which, while truthful, may not be of any actual use to their questioner. This particular effect does much to offset the view of a novice interrogator that a truth serum is a sort of panacea to any kind of closely guarded secret; most take quickly to heart the strengths and limitations of such methods after tediously sitting through hours upon hours of inane prattle by heavily drugged-up subjects. Truth serum is known by a variety of names in various circles; the Inquisition and Adeptus Arbites often refers to these types of drugs as "The Truth Revealed", while Scintillan enforcers are more likely to call it "Verity". Among gangers and lowhive scum, the common names are notably more callous and vulgar.

Truth serums of all types must be injected into the subject and become effective after 2d10 minutes. The drug remains in the subject's body for 3d5 hours minus a number of hours equal to the suject's Toughness Bonus (minimum 0). During this time, the subject takes a -30 penalty to all Tests made to resist Interrogation Tests being made against them. However, the interrogator also suffers a -10 penalty to their Interrogation Tests to sort out the useless babble from the information they're actually looking for. If the subject also has the Blather Talent, this penalty increases to -20. If the interrogator uses the Inquiry Skill instead of Interrogation (see Lines of Inquiry on page 232 of _The Inquisitor's Handbook_), the subject's penalty to resisting the interrogation increases to -50, the serum leaving them much more pliant to this form of verbal explication.

### Wideawake (Drug)

Wideawake, as the name implies, is intended to ward off feelings of sleepiness in those who keep long hours. This drug is composed of longacting psychostimulants compressed into small tablets that break down slowly once ingested, providing a feeling of alertness and focus that is normally lost once the wearer begins to suffer from sleep deprivation. Though effective, it is a cheap substance designed for the masses, so its effects are limited in situations more stressful than running an all-night watch or heavy cogitator manipulation. The tablets themselves are typically found in small sealed packets that can be easily stuffed into a pocket or bag, and are so ubiquitous in certain lines of work that automat machines which usually stock cheap foodstuffs and refreshments can dispense the little plastek packets too.

A dose of wideawake takes 20 minutes to become effective and lasts for 2d5 hours. During this time the character can ignore the effects of Fatigue on his mental Characteristics (Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship), though taking too many levels of Fatigue will still result in unconsciousness. When the drug wears off the character gains a level of Fatigue as the over-worked portions of his mind begin to demand rest; note that this can push an already-exhausted user into unconsciousness, as more than a few adepts have learned after waking up at their stations with a runeboard's tactiles temporarily embedded in their faces.

### Frontier Consumables

Those travelling to the undeveloped fringes of the Calixis Sector - missionaries, explorers, huntsmen, mercenaries, and so forth - will typically find a whole new spectrum of things to eat and drink, some of which may even be palatable. Worlds that are largely untouched by the sprawling domestic industries of Imperial society typically have extremely insular culture and this extends to all matters of consumables, making each new world an explorer happens to set foot on likely more bizarre than the last. This section highlights some of the more unusual examples that can be found on the less developed worlds of the Sector.

Note that the Availability of any consumable whose name lists it as being found on certain worlds only applies on that same world - it may be much rarer or totally nonexistent elsewhere.

#### Belly-Churn

This is a staple of nomadic riders that inhabit worlds like Balecaster and Fervious. The food gets its name from the use of a slain animal's stomach as part of the preparation. The organ is removed and washed out, then filled with milk and sewn shut so it curdles during the natural movement of the stomach when slung over a trotting mount. If it is allowed to develop long enough - which is sometimes not an option if the nomads can't find more sources of fresh food the cheese within becomes a true delicacy that is highly nutritious and keeps for a surprisingly long time. Even some off-world explorers and Imperial missionaries have commented that the belly-churn's final product is surprisingly tasty.

#### Dryas (Drug)

Dryas is a compound that is derived from desert-dwelling reptiles native to the agri-world Dreah. These skittish creatures have an incredible resilience to the arid environment in which they inhabit, and it is said that consuming one can sustain a lost traveller in the desert for days. Mechanicus explorators have, at great effort, discovered a method to derive an extract from the Drean fauna that provides similar effects without the need to chase one down and eat it. A dose of dryas causes sharp though temporary changes in the user's biochemistry, allowing them to survive with a drastically lower water intake and making them less susceptible to death from heat exhaustion. There are some undesirable side-effects, however, which include degraded senses and a nauseating sense of weakness. Few would willingly take dryas unless the alternative is a slow demise.

A dose of dryas takes about an hour to become effective and lasts for 1d10 days minus the user's Toughness Bonus (minimum 3). During that time the user gains a +20 bonus to any Survival Tests made to withstand arid conditions and needs only half as much his usual water intake. However, the drug's lassitude imparts a -10 penalty to any Strength- and Perception-based Tests the user might undertake, and also reduces the user's Fellowship by 1d5 points due to his slurred speech and absent manner.

#### Ration Grubs

A native fauna of the infamous death world Dusk, these small and wiggly larvae have an incredible nutritional content that puts even the best-engineered of high-energy rations to shame. It is unknown who first attempted to voluntarily eat one of lanet's well-known e to human life of the Ad eir va bs lo a Dusk's insects, giving that p reputation for being hostil , but once representatives eptus Mechanicus became aware of th lue a thriving industry in harvesting the gru b ssomed there. Once preserved through special freeze-drying process, the so-called ration grubs will keep for years without losing any nutritional value. Just one of these thumbsized creatures can sustain a grown man for an entire day regardless of his level of physical activity, essentially making it the ultimate in light-travelling sustenance. The flavour, however, is unspeakably bad, leading to some quips that the Dusk-born creature is at least lethal to one's appetite. Aside from the taste, it is known that the grubs mature into a sinister winged insect with a deadly sting - residual toxicity in the grub's flesh probably makes it a poor choice for long-term consumption.

#### Sleep Dust (Drug)

At some point in the recent past, native apothecaries from Zillman's Domain discovered - quite by accident - that crushing the seeds of a common red-and-black flower into a fine powder produces a substance with profoundly soporific qualities. A strong whiff can flutter eyelids, while inhalation or  ingestion stuff will drop a fully grown man of average constitution in minutes, sending them off into a restful sleep for hours. Once the dust wears off character will likely awaken (unless seriously sleep deprives beforehand), feeling some what drowsy for a few more hours but otherwise suffering no ill effects. The powder is tasteless, and if ground adequately, can be mixed into food without perceptible alteration of the flavor or texture. Those who export sleep dust from Zillman's Domain would like to think that they are simply helping the restless get some badly needed shut-eye, though many user then to have less honorable intention for ampules of capsules of the power.  

A character who inhales sleep dust, such as having an ampule broken open under their nose or a handful blown in their face, must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or pass out, falling into a deep sleep for 1d5 hours minus the victim's Toughness Bonus. Ingesting the powder magnifies its effects, though they take about 20 minutes to become active - the Toughness Test becomes Hard (-20) and the victim does not reduce the duration of his sleep. If the character succeeds on his Toughness Test he suffers no perceptible effects and will remain unaware of his attempted drugging, although a face full of strange powder might provoke other questions for the would-be assailant.

#### Endrite Sour Mud

Feral shamans and witch doctors native to the planet Endrite scoop this vicious and sticky substance out of dormant tar pits which line vast stretches of that world. Many feral healer remedies can be more dangerous than the ills they claim to cure, but the so-called "sour mud" is actually laden with minerals and enzymes that have strong antibacterial and immunogenic qualities. Sour mud is most often used to staunch bleeding - simply plastering some of the stuff on a wound and then working it into a putty-like mass causes rapid coagulation and staves off infection. However, it also has other medicinal qualities - if diluted and boiled, it can be ingested to reduce fevers and diarrhoea, though the taste is extremely bitter (hence the name). Because of these miraculous qualities, some of which border on well-developed Imperial technology, several corporations and commercia guilds have expressed interest in creating a large-scale packaging and export operation on Endrite to get the sour mud into circulation throughout the sector. Finding a means to keep the mud fresh, however, has proven elusive.

A character can use a handful of sour mu immediately end ongo d to ing Blood Loss by sp ending a Full Action to massage the mud into the bleeding injury. Additionally, medics attempting to treat certain diseases and fevers gain a +20 bonus on any Medicae Tests when using sour mud as part of the treatment.

#### Munsk Spirit Tonic (Drug?)

world have commented at length about the spirit tonic's "notably unpleasant" flavour, which has sparked much curiosity as to exactly what is used to make it - the native brewmasters are notoriously tight-lipped on the subject. Regardless of what goes into it, the thick and adipose drink imparts a stiff measure of drunken courage and audacity in the imbiber. Munsk's tribesmen therefore consume the stuff as a matter of nearly religious reverence before going on hunts, making war, or confronting spouses. This alcoholic brew originates from Munsk's northern continent where it is rumoured that that region's many small rodents form one of the main ingredients. Imperial missionaries on that

A dose of spirit tonic takes about 20 minutes to take effect, thereafter granting the consumer a +20 bonus on Fear Tests for 1d5 hours as he feels far more brave and certain than before. This intoxicated overconfidence also impairs judgment and leaves common sense somewhat lacking, however, imparting a -10 penalty on any Intelligence-based Tests for the same duration. A character can attempt a Carouse Test at the time of consumption to negate the substance's effects. Habitual consumption of spirit tonic over a long period can cause brain damage, effectively making the above effects permanent.

#### Fervious Styger Milk

king to the thick drink, consuming it as a matter of etiquette (and allies) due to its to Styger herders try to gain a monopoly on a region's supply. The Styger is a well-known beast of burden on Fervious and has a vast cultural significance to the herding bands that make their livelihood off of the creatures. When a Styger births a whelp it produces a viscous fluid broadly similar to milk for the whelp to nourish off of, which the native herdsmen swear can ward off poison and other maladies that one might inadvertently consume. Though strong of taste, the stuff is very nutritious, and a man could survive off of a diet of Styger milk alone for days at a time, though any kind of long-term consumption tends to cause unspeakably bad "digestive complications". A boon to farmers and herders to be sure, Fervious' nobles have also taken a li when dining with rivals xin-neutralizing qualities. In some areas, the peasant farmers who have more than a few dozen head have become quite wealthy in their own right, and small scale "milk wars" are not entirely unheard of as oppositional bands of

A character consuming Styger milk finds it coating his throat and stomach - this somewhat unpleasant feeling imparts a +20 bonus on any Toughness Tests made to resist ingested poisons or toxins. The protective quality lasts 1d5+5 hours, though the sticky sensation (and taste) lingers for a while longer. Consuming two or more doses of Styger milk in a 24 hour period can be dangerous to the digestive organs - the character must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer one point of Toughness Damage. Failure by two or more degrees results in this Damage being permanent.

### Specialty Consumables

Some things just aren't made for most men. Whether very costly, unobtainable, areaspecific, or serving only a very narrow purpose, consumable items in this section are typically not encountered by most Imperial citizens. An Acolyte of the Emperor's Inquisition, however, would do well to familiarise himself with such oddities and unusual finds - a lack of prior knowledge is a poor excuse for failure.

#### Blush

This expensive though remarkably smooth libation is derived from small yellow fruits that inexplicably grow on several distantly dispersed worlds near the edge of the Malfian Sub-Sector. Once mashed into juice and pulp, the sicklysweet mixture is fermented in stone vats before being packaged in elegant and shapely bottles for later consumption. The drink has a complex and warm sapor which imparts a pleasantly glowing feeling as it infiltrates the drinker's bloodstream. The glow, however, is quite literal - while intoxication sets in the drinker actually begins to emit a reddish-pinkish hue that increases in intensity when more blush is consumed. Likewise, the aura fades in much the same way when sobriety reasserts itself. These secondary qualities make blush exceedingly popular with debauched young nobles who often make games over seeing who can glow the brightest before joining their fellow revellers on the floor.

#### Civilian Relief Rations

Starvation is often one of the most effective weapons that can be wielded against a human population centre, a fact which is not lost on the enemies of mankind. Civilian relief rations are a special type of food product created by the Departmento Munitorum and issued to Imperial Guard units tasked with defending or liberating cities, hives, and other urban areas threatened with siege by the enemy. Designed to be durable enough to be thrown out of flyers or even launched by artillery in special canisters, relief rations take the form of unappealing bricks of recycled food waste, processed synth-protein, or just about any other form of organic matter that has some nutritional content. The individually wrapped parcels are waterproof and small enough to be stuffed into a pocket or satchel and contain enough food energy to keep a man alive for a day. The flavour ranges from "bad" to "horrendous", but this is a minor consideration when the alternative is death by malnourishment or enslavement by the unspeakable armies of mankind's enemies.

#### Clear (Drug)

Sometimes sold as an "imbiber's aid", this substance bestows a remarkable endurance against the depressant effects of alcohol. Clear blocks some natural biologic processes that metabolise alcohol and other intoxicants, and while it does not prevent drunkenness itself, a drinker under this drug's effects can pound away serving after serving without keeling over when they've reached their limit. However, care must be taken during rounds of heavy drinking as it is quite possible for an imbiber under Clear's effects to drink himself to death right at the table. Clear is derived from plants originally found on Monrass, whose tar-like sap is refined into sticks of gum that are chewed to release its fortifying effects. Despite being a favorite of both low-hive "pound houses" and debased galas for the well-to-do, Clear almost inevitably gifts its consumer a nasty migraine once the drug has run its course. True revellers simply take another hit before the first has expired, though the wise take this sudden headache as a sign that it's time to turn in (often with a powerful sleep aid).

Clear takes about 20 minutes to become effective, and thereafter the user gains the Decadence talent if they did not already possess it as well as a +30 bonus to Toughness-based Tests to resist falling unconscious due to consumption of alcohol or other poisons (either due to excessive Fatigue or drugs that specifically cause a "knock-out" effect). This resistance lasts for roughly three hours, after which the drug wears off; if the user still has more levels of Fatigue than they would normally be able to withstand, they fall unconscious as normal. Once the drug wears off, the character is afflicted by a debilitating headache and suffers a -20 penalty to any Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, or Fellowship-based Tests for 1d5+1 hours. Additional doses of Clear taken in succession increase this duration by another 2 hours for each dose.

#### Countersepts (Drug)

Short for "counterseptics", these innocuous tablets are a gift from the Emperor Himself to soldiers, explorers, pilgrims, and others who find themselves in suddenly foetid conditions. Each contain broad-spectrum chemical, mineral, and probiotic ingredients that help stave off infection or disease, which can often be just as deadly as a hot bullet or a long fall. Countersepts are standard-issue kit to Guardsmen operating in foul environments, and those travelling to unknown regions would be well advised to bring a few doses in the event of complications.

Countersepts provide a +20 bonus to any Toughness Tests made to resist initial contraction of diseases and infections, but have no benefit on an already existent condition. One dose is good for an entire day.

#### Eazielle (Drug)

Known informally as "Eaze", this potent mind affecting substance is brought into the Calixis Sector through Port Wander; there does not appear to be any definitive evidence of its source, though hushed whispers have suggested it is alien in origin. Once ingested, Eaze has a pronounced effect on reducing the user's inhibitions, imparting a relaxed and nonchalant state without negatively affecting perception and physical ability as other drugs often can. The results are staggering, often allowing users to brush off or simply accept illicit and depraved actions or scenes that would induce horror or sickness in any moral Imperial citizen. The ability to totally suppress one's conscience and engage in the most base desires makes Eazielle a common sight among nobles and guilder elites that have become truly debauched. However, a far more insidious application comes from wellfunded cults that use this drug to help introduce new members to the fold. Because of this association with corrupting agents of the Ruinous Powers, some Inquisitors of the Ordo Hereticus deem this drug to be "Heresy in a vial" and aggressively seek and persecute its distributors, often as a stepping stone to uncovering the cult leaders that foist it on the unsuspecting citizenry. Repeated use of Eazielle tends to prolong its effects; in some cases, the user's personality can become permanently warped, turning them into deranged cretins un-phased by any atrocity.

Eazielle must be injected and becomes effective in one Round. For the next 1d5 hours, the user gains the Jaded talent if they did not already possess it, automatically succeeds on any Fear Tests against a Fear Rating of 2 or less, and will freely ignore the dictates of morality; the user must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test to ignore baser instincts and urges. What circumstances call for such Tests are highly situational and ultimately up to the GM.

The duration of Eazielle's effect is increased by 1 hour for each dose the user has consumed in the last week. Should the user ever be under the effect of the drug for more than 10 hours from a single dose, its effects become permanent.

#### Gorsk White Gyn

Gorsk White is an incredibly stiff spirit that is partly distilled from modified engine coolant, hence the play on words for "gin". The original vintages, if they can be called that, were first popularized in the Magnagorsk hive on Fenksworld, but now many hive worlds have an industry of producing the caustic and ice-cloudy drink in a variety of local styles. Though inexpensive and often thought of as an intoxicant for drudging masses, "gyn mixers" have been seen in the halls of the upper classes too - a desire for booze with more kick than triple-stilled amasec apparently is not limited to the fringes of Imperial society. Aside from making the drinker feel as though his head's been staved in, Gorsk White and its peers can be diluted and used to mitigate the effects of some tainted food and water thanks to their antibacterial qualities.

Drinking unmixed gyn of any kind requires a Hard (-20) Carouse Test if the drinker wants to try and resist intoxication.

#### Holdfast (Drug)

Much more of a tool than a narcotic, holdfast is a potent neural blocker that retards the effects of other drugs that target the user's mind. This mental stiffness manifests itself in the form of a strongly stubborn and inflexible attitude, but otherwise has no outwardly perceptible side effects. Holdfast is most commonly employed by deep infiltrators and espionage agents, not infrequently on both sides of the law, due to its ability to fortify the mind against truth serums and other forms of prying.

A user must inject holdfast to gain its benefits. 1d10 minutes after taking a dose, the user gains the Resistance (Interrogation) talent for 1d5+5 hours, but also suffers a -10 penalty to Willpower-based Tests for all other purposes and a further -5 penalty to Fellowship-based Tests due to an ornery disposition. Interrogations based on chemicals or other drugs, such as the use of an excruciator, are less effective against a character under the effects of holdfast; the user gains a further +20 bonus to resist such attempts. The presence of holdfast cannot be detected by a medicae auspex or tox wand, though de-tox still flushes it out.

#### Hyperexia (Drug)

This unique physic is originally thought to have been developed by explorers braving the harsh climate of Penolpass, where a primitive version is consumed by ranging scouts and frontier hunters. Hyperexia must be consumed in regular measured doses over a period of about two weeks, during which time it slowly affects considerable changes in the consumer's various bodily humours. The skin toughens and major organs become more resilient to the effects of exposure, allowing a bare-skinned man to brave conditions usually better suited for heavy environmental clothing or a climate-controlled ground car. Excessive use of hyperexia can have more pronounced side effects, some of which may be beneficial in the short term. Such abuse is not unknown among Penolpass' quick and lethal warriors, who dangerously toughen their bodies to help offset a lack of armour.

Hyperexia must be ingested once a day over a period of twelve days, after which time the user gains the Resistance (Cold, Heat) talent due to a generally toughened physique. A user must maintain a regular regimen of hyperexia, taking one dose each week, in order to maintain its resilience. If the user consumes twice the recommended dosage, taking two doses per day for twenty-four days, they also gain the Natural Armour (2) trait. Such wanton abuse invariably overtaxes the body; the user will fall unconscious after accumulating only half their Toughness Bonus in Fatigue, and will have a 20% chance to die from Blood Loss, rather than the usual 10%.

#### Night Dust (Drug)

Among innumerable other horrors, the feral world of Dusk is home to a savage predatory creature that the native tribesmen refer to as Nightwings. A Nightwing does not attack its victims directly, preferring to sprinkle them with a potent hallucinogenic dust it extrudes from veins in its wings. Once the victim passes into a nightmarish stupor, the hematophagous Nightwing sucks them dry with its sieve-like fangs, leaving the victim a desiccated husk in mere minutes. For reasons best left unexplored, there are those that have survived a Nightwing attack and found the experience somehow exciting or desirous, and Nightwing dust (or "night dust" for short) has propagated far beyond Dusk itself. The dust is harvested from slain or captive Nightwings and rendered down into a concentrate where it is shipped out to nefarious peddlers and dealers throughout the Sector. Night dust is typically consumed by burning it as an incense and inhaling the resultant smoke, but a more powerful effect can be created by dissolving the powder in fortified amasec and consuming the resultant brew. Once the drug takes effect the user is locked in a dream-racked narcosis that can last for days on end - many users find the frightening and violent visions to be off-putting enough to steer clear of the stuff thereafter. It is said that a socalled "dusk dream" shows the user dark facets of their own mind. If true, those who find the trip to be an enjoyable diversion are likely even more twisted and sinister than they appear. The severity of a night dust experience can be profoundly altering to the user, and the term "dust dream" is sometimes used in Malfian parlance to refer to a sudden disappearance or bout of madness.

Once a character uses a dose of night dust they immediately begin to experience strange hallucinations and dissociative influences. This initial stage imparts a -20 penalty on all Tests and lasts for 1d10+10 minutes. Afterward, the user falls into a deep, feverish slumber filled with vivid dreams that reflect the deepest and most depraved sections of the user's subconscious. The user remains locked in their own mind for 1d5-2 days (if the result is 0 or less, the effect lasts for 2d10 hours instead). Upon returning to his senses, the user must pass an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points from their maddening visions. If the user chose to ingest rather than smoke the night dust, the effects are more powerful: the user remains asleep for 1d5 days and must pass a Difficult (- 10) Willpower Test or else gain 1d10 Insanity Points when the drug wears off.

#### Panimmune (Drug)

Panimmune is a powerful medicinal compound that gives the user a massive boost to their natural resistance against toxins, contamination, parasites, and other infectious agents, making it a highly sought-after item for explorers and travellers as well as enforcers and agents pursuing targets into fetid hiding spots. The drug takes the form of a disposable hypospray tube that administers the panimmune via a tiny high-pressure jet into the user's neck. The strong mixture of counter septics and inert toxin-absorbing compounds can be a literal lifesaver in situations where even light injuries or switching re-breather canisters can be fatal, but it is extremely dangerous to use over a long term period as the potent mixture can upset the user's bodily humours - possibly with fatal results. Panimmune should never be confused with painimmune; though similar in name, the effects are wholly different, and a mistake in dosage between the two could be catastrophic.

Once injected a dose of panimmune immediately provides a +30 bonus on Toughness Tests made to withstand most poisons, diseases, toxins and infections. An unintended side effect, this bonus also applies to Carouse Tests as well. The effect lasts for 1d5+5 hours. Once the drug wears off, the user takes a -10 penalty on the same Toughness Tests as their body's natural defences are somewhat weakened by the loss of the drug's fortifying effect. The user can re-dose immediately, but taking more than one dose without first having a full night's rest (about 8 hours) to allow their humours to "reset" can be perilous. In this case, the user must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or permanently lose 1 point of Toughness and Willpower. Characters that do not sleep, such as heavily augmented Tech-Priests, may be active during this period as normal, though taking a second dose in any 8 hour period still has the same consequences.

#### Painimmune (Drug)

While many of the more steely Imperial servants might grimly recant that "pain is weakness leaving the body", or perhaps more jovially, "pain lets you know you're still alive", most men find these catechisms to be of little comfort when suffering from a terrible injury or sickness. Painimmune, as the name suggests, is a long-acting analgesic that suppresses physical pain (along with just about every other sense) for therapeutic purposes. Painimmune is widely used as a post-surgical recovery aid, especially when a patient has received a cybernetic implant or some other major procedure that can cause systemic shock, and is typically administered in a slow-drip infusion to spread a dose out over time. Acolytes of the Imperial Inquisition are more likely to encounter single-use injectorampoules that are commonly used in combat situations. In this format, a single ampoule is typically used by a medic to help stabilize a wounded comrade until more thorough treatment can be administered. Alternatively, a victim that is too grievously wounded might be given two doses and then simply left to meet the God-Emperor in peace, a manoeuvre known commonly as a "medicae mercy killing". Though designed to help heal, or at least soothe physical languishment, pain immune's powerful effects on the nervous system can also be extremely dangerous, with overdoses being almost invariably fatal. The drug can also be addictive - patients who have been under a heavy regimen during convalescence may find themselves dangerously dosing themselves long after their original injuries have healed.

A dose of pain immune becomes effective in one Round and completely suppresses feelings of pain or discomfort for 1d5+1 hours. During this time the user gains a number of levels of Fatigue equal to his Toughness Bonus as he enters a sedate euphoria; the user is so relaxed that he also automatically succeeds on any Fear Tests against a Fear Rating of 2 or less and can ignore the effects of Pinning. If a second dose is taken during this time the duration is increased by another 1d5+1 hours and the user falls unconscious as their various biological processes begin to shut down. The user takes 1 point of Toughness Damage every 5 minutes until the drug wears off or their Toughness becomes 0, at which point they die peacefully.

A character taking more than four doses of painimmune in a weeklong period must succeed on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test or become addicted. Once addicted, the user starts each day with one level of Fatigue that can't be removed until the user takes a dose. Normally, this means the Fatigue gained when taking a dose of painimmune would knock the addict unconscious; an addict who wishes to remain at least somewhat functional for the day may make an Ordinary (+10) Intelligence Test or a Routine (+20) Chem-Use or Medicae Test. With success, the addict carefully administers a measured dose, and his Fatigue becomes equal to his Toughness Bonus instead of exceeding it. It takes three weeks of abstinence to overcome a painimmune addiction.

The rules described above refer to individual doses of painimmune meant to be used in the field - therapeutic dosages used as part of longterm recovery and treatment are considered to fall under the Medicae skill when used in a hospice or similarly-outfitted environment (this includes the potential of becoming addicted as a side-effect of treatment).

#### Quaddis Wine

The world of Quaddis is something of a mystery in and of itself. It does not appear on many star charts, and the area of space it inhabits is notably desolate. There are also no stable warp lanes to or from the isolated planet, putting it off limits from chartist captains and other voidfarers who lack Navigators. Many members of the Sector's lower classes would simply assume that the world is a legend or a byword for fantasy, but there are those that know better - though many wouldn't admit it. In reality, Quaddis' more temperate regions are highly fertile, and the privately-owned fiefdoms that carve out much of these areas have turned some of their pleasure grounds over to the production of fine beverages. A number of fabulously rich and flavourful vintages originate on Quaddis - many of these bottles never leave, being consumed by their growers or spilled on the bodies of wild revellers in the perpetually debauched planetary capital of Xicarph, but there is a hot market among rich off-world collectors and connoisseurs. Maintaining a steady supply can be an endeavour in and of itself, even for those who have the funds to do so. Between shipping difficulties, and the fact that Quaddis' brutal winters often kill off a large number of the wine-producing vineyards, it is advisable to stock up when you can.

##### Golden Tokay

This rich and flavourful wine has tiny gold shavings added to the casks as it ferments, giving the final product a barelyperceptible metallic tone that neatly complements a slightly sweet and nutty character. The gold particles go out with the bottles, and it is generally considered a good omen to find a bit of gold in the bottom of one's glass once the wine itself has been drunk.

##### Kataline Malmsey

Unquestionably a head above its peers, the Kataline Malmsey is an especially exquisite wine famed for its smoothness and subtle yet satisfying flavours with a bouquet "reminiscent of newly-fallen rain and nostalgic memories". The vineyards that produce this exceptional variety are annihilated annually by meters of snow and ice, resulting in each vintage being different than the last. Some especially storied years are said to be of a particularly incredible quality, imparting a sort of euphoric intoxication that has literally killed a few drinkers who dared to overindulge in such a singular libation. Whether this effect is truly a death resultant from pure pleasure or simply a cardiac infarction in a more corpulent consumer is unknown, though it does make fine table talk.

##### Sorrowful Vintage

"Sorrowful Vintage" is a broad term applied to wines that have all the qualities of a fine Quaddis vintage but which, through careful inspection, turn out to be imitations or mixed bottles of less spectacular wines. Though immediately less valuable than a true Quaddis original - both in terms of wealth material as well as social - Sorrowful Vintages are still an exquisite drink in and of themselves and remain highly desirable among aficionados. Many have even made a deliberate sport of the stuff, entertaining guests and their fellows with exaggerated tales of the tragedy of discovering the bottle's imperfect origins.

#### Raenka

This stout liquor is almost synonymous with "space captains" and the officers of voidfaring ships throughout many of the far reaches of Segmentum Obscurus. Raenka is primarily distilled from the already much-endeared ploin fruit, though arriving at a proper alcoholic conclusion requires a lengthy distillation in barrels that have already been used in the production of amasec (so the wood absorbs the reaction, or so the distilleries say). The resulting drink would be considered a brandy by Imperial standards, with a mellow flavour and subtle bouquet that carries a pleasantly juxtaposing bite from its high alcohol content. Raenka is inevitably bottled in transparent containers to show off its pleasing yellow-amber hue, and even feudal distilleries go to great lengths to offer ornate and elegant bottles for their sky-hailing buyers. Much like the ploin fruit it is derived from raenka has a strong following among those who spend long voyages in the void, and many shipyards hold a sacred tradition of smashing a bottle of the stuff against the hull of ships newly ordained or returned to service after a long overhaul. Incongruously enough, red robed observers from the Adeptus Mechanicus usually frown on such frivolities.

Raenka's strongly fortified character imposes a -5 penalty on Carouse Tests made to stay sober while consuming it.

#### Rainbow (Drug)

So named for the all-encompassing spectrum of treatments contained, rainbow is an advanced drug concoction meant to be used in life-or-death situations where a more specific treatment can't be diagnosed in a timely basis. Rainbow contains numerous individual medicinals, including anti-allergen compounds, anti-bacterial serum, blood-clotting agents, poison antidotes, antirad chemicals, broadband immune stimulators, a whole slew of vitamins, and a potent sedative - the latter most ingredient often jabbed at as being included "just because". The sheer amount of bioreactive substances being injected at once can cause massive system shock to the victim - as a result, rainbow is typically only used as a drug of last resort or where a medicae must take a gamble when fighting an unknown ailment. Rainbow is so powerful that the drug is actually referenced in Administratum code as part of the Lex Medicae - officially, rainbow cannot be administered without the victim's consent. Of course, this is rarely enforced outside of established hospices and convalescent sanatoriums as critical emergencies are the very reason for the drug's use in the first place.

After being injected with a dose of rainbow, a victim can immediately re-roll any Toughness Tests to resist most diseases and toxins, with success ending any ongoing effects, though it does not reverse existing conditions or Damage already taken. If the character is suffering from

Blood Loss that condition ends as well. At the same time, the character must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. Success causes them to gain a single level of Fatigue, while failure inflicts 1d5 levels as well as 1d5 points of Damage that ignores Armour and Toughness. Note that the character is subjected to this secondary effect regardless of whether or not the dose helped them overcome an existing condition or ailment.

#### Red-Eye (Drug)

This innocuous-looking solution is applied to the eyes directly using a dropper or microsprayer and causes a state of hyper-sensitivity to the furthest ends of visible light, functionally allowing the user to "see" sources of heat without the need for a bulky set of IR goggles. Because of the increased blood flow that follows, the user's eyes take on a reddish hue, giving the drug its common name. This visual effect fades after a few hours, but prolonged use of red-eye can result in permanent discoloration. Other than an expensive novelty, light-travelling military teams and saboteurs are known to favor this drug for removing costly and often unreliable gear from their kit, while other clandestine operatives may require expanded sight in situations where wearing or even possessing a set of IR goggles is not an option.

Taking a dose of red-eye requires two Full Actions (one for each eye). The drug becomes effective one minute later, and for all intents and purposes the user is considered to be wearing a set of infrared goggles for the next 1d5+1 hours. Once the drug wears off, the user is left with residual light sensitivity, and must pass a Difficult (-10) Toughness Test. Failure causes the user to suffer a -20 penalty to Ballistic Skill and sight-based Perception Tests while in areas of bright light (such as being outdoors during the day or in a well-lit room) for the same amount of time as he was under the drug's initial effect. If the Toughness Test is failed by three or more degrees this penalty persists for a full day.

#### Sandstone (Drug)

Sandstone's existence is a tale of pure serendipity. Originally derived from pollen produced by flowering plants on Cyrus Vulpa, the vast herds of grox raised on that world are known to have a particular affinity for consuming it. This curious occurrence made its way to Quaddis, where the infamous Pleasuremeisters sought to use its neuro-reactive properties to devise greater and more powerful psychotropic drugs for the indulgence of the wealthy and debased patrons there. This too was a failure; the best of their efforts produced a substance that bestowed heightened mental determination and focus, little use for debauched revellers, but a potent asset for hard-nosed enforcers and investigators as well as military snipers and ganger heavies. Sandstone takes the form of small cubes of tightly compressed powder that dissolve almost instantly if exposed to liquids. These are unwrapped and then crushed on the fingers, the resultant grit rubbed into the gums where it permeates into nerves close to the brain. Once under the effect of Sandstone, a user's fortified mind more easily shrugs off fearsome opponents and horrific sights as well as more mundane concerns such as boredom and hunger, though its use as a recreational substance is strongly dampened by a nasty malaise that overtakes the user as the drug's effects wear off and their mind rebels against being unwillingly focused.

Using Sandstone requires a Full Action and takes effect in 1d10 minutes. For the next 1d5+3 hours, the user gains a +30 bonus on most Willpower Tests made to resist external stimuli, such as Fear or Pinning, Interrogation, Trauma Tests, psychic powers that affect the mind, and so forth. Once the drug's effects expire, the user must attempt a Difficult (-10) Toughness Test, with failure reducing their Intelligence, Willpower, and Fellowship by 10 points. The lost points are recovered at a rate of one per hour (see Characteristic Damage on page 200 of _Dark Heresy_ for more information).

#### Scav-Glysten (Drug)

A powerful odour-suppressant, scav-glysten is a heavily refined and purified derivative of oily stabilising liquids often drunk by low-hive reclamators and junk dealers for the humble purpose of reducing their stink. No more cosmetic, scav-glysten works through the bloodstream to alter the user's sweat glands, digestive fluids, and other bodily humours to completely block all recognisable scents and smells, functionally rendering the user odourless for hours. Originally manufactured on Synford, scav-glysten is now sold in specialty shops on many hive worlds in the Golgenna Reach, primarily for use by deep infiltrators and agents, though some elite military units have been known to make use of the stuff to create more perfect ambushes and evasions. Contrary to common thought, scav-glysten is almost invariably eschewed by professional huntsmen as the total lack of scent can be just as disturbing to wild beasts as the stink of men.

Scav-Glysten becomes effective 10 minutes after being injected and thereafter lasts for 1d10+1 hours. During this time, any attempts made to track or identify the user by scent automatically fail. Note that scav-glysten can fully suppress bodily odours but has no effect on clothing or gear, so a thorough cleaning prior to use may be prudent.

#### Scrapper-Ripper (Drug)

More commonly known as Ripper, this drug is manufactured using compounds that are extracted from rare, hideous creatures that live in the lowest depths of certain hive cities in the Golgenna Reach. Once refined through a long alchemical process, Ripper can be injected into the bloodstream where it quickly travels to the user's reactive centres and effectively supercharges their nervous system. A user under the effect of Ripper is able to make sharp, sudden movements with incredible quickness (sometimes even to the detriment of the rest of their body...) that often leaves observers gaping in surprise. However, any Ripper user would be well advised to remember that while the drug does drastically accelerate their ability to make quick manoeuvres, there is no corresponding boost to the user's sensory and perceptive centres. Aside from leaving the user extremely "twitchy", they become prone to reacting violently to almost any kind of external stimuli; there are countless tales of Ripper users brutally accosting their fellows or bystanders from some perceived threat, the user only realizing they've attacked after the blow has been struck. Because of this drug's close association with underhive Scrapper gangs, the principal distributors of the stuff to other gangers and up-hive heavies alike, the drug is more formally known as Scrapper-Ripper in official parlance.

A dose of Scrapper-Ripper becomes effective in 1d5 Rounds and lasts for 1d5 hours. While under its effects, the user gains a +30 bonus to all Agility-based Tests made as part of a Reaction, although the hyper-stimulating effects of the drug also reduce the user's Perception and Willpower Characteristics by 10 points for the same length of time. Additionally, the user must succeed on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test to avoid brutally attacking anything or anyone that surprise s or startles them. 

#### Slam (Drug)

Slam is unquestionably the worst, most destructive kind of combat drug imaginable. It should therefore be no surprise that the horrid stuff originated on Fenksworld's nightmarish Hive Volg. Its manufacture is similarly unpleasant. The raw materials are chemical residue gathered from the digestive tracts of hulking corpse roaches that infest the meat sumps in Volg's worst districts. The gooey and caustic substance is crystallized in an alkaline bath and then ground into a bile yellow powder before being diluted in what's hopefully water. Moments after being injected, slam causes a rapid biological change in the user, creating hyperactive muscular growth that often causes the user to visibly bulge and spasm. The user's nerves are greatly deadened during the process, leaving them to feel only a monstrous rush of power and energy that is frequently accompanied by an intense urge to commit violence. Diluted slam can easily cause long term damage to the user's circulatory and nervous system, even in small doses. Those who hail from Volg would consider this a small price to pay when faced with the choice of being devoured by a ravenous maw-fluke or dosing up and then ripping its jaws off with their bare hands. Use of slam is a matter of survival on Volg, but a thriving black market for the drug exists on other worlds where users take the destructive substance to wreak havoc on their enemies, often with little concern (or perhaps understanding) of the consequences. Pure slam, still suspended in an alkaline solution, can be injected as well - the results are almost inevitably fatal for the user, but the sheer destruction that a "slammed" hiver can create before their organs ru ture is a spectacle in and of itself.

A dose of diluted slam becomes effective in one Round and grants the user the Unnatural Strength (x2) and Unnatural Toughness (x2) traits for 1d5+TB Rounds. The user must pass an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test or enter into a violent rage as if they'd taken a dose of frenzon, though the effect only lasts as long as the slam itself. When the drug wears off, the character must pass an Arduous (-40) Toughness Test or permanently reduce their Strength haracteristics by 1d5 points each.

Pure slam is even more dangerous. The drug takes effect immediately, with the character gaining the Unnatural Strength (x3), Unnatural Toughness (x3), and Unnatural Speed traits for a number of Rounds equal to twice their Toughness Bonus. The character goes completely berserk as if under the effects of ghostfire pollen extract, crushing friend and foe alike. Once this time has passed the drug begins to "wear off" - the effects do not actually end until twice again the user's Toughness Bonus in Rounds have passed, however. During this latter phase the character must pass a Very Hard (- 30) Toughness Test each Round or gain a level of Fatigue (ignoring its effects per the Frenzy talent). If the user accumulates more levels of Fatigue than his Toughness Bonus he drops dead from catastrophic cardiac failure. In the unlikely event the user survives until the pure slam works its way through him he immediately falls unconscious for 1d5-TB hours (minimum 1) and must pass an Arduous (-40) Toughness Test or permanently reduce his Strength characteristics by 1d5 points each.

Note that this accumulated Fatigue cannot be removed in any way until the drug wears off - even de-tox is ineffective against pure slam's terrible effects.

#### Somna (Drug)

An unusual and curious drug to say the least, somna is created from a synthesized extract of the Nephys Orchid of Iocanthus. When properly refined and condensed, somna instils a wave of shifts in the user's bodily humours, inducing a coma-like state and very nearly shutting their biological processes down. The character hovers on the very brink of death, their consciousness plunged into a bottomless abyss far beyond even the deepest sleep, while their body can survive without food or water and on an imperceptible amount of air for up to several weeks. Like clockwork, the user will apparently rise from the dead a predetermined amount of time later, possibly feeling ravenously hungry but otherwise suffering no ill effects. A man under the effects of somna appears to be dead for all intents and purposes - an auspex scan reports a corpse, while all but the most skilled medicae will write the user off as well. Somna can even fool the soulscouring powers of a trained psyker, making the stuff immensely useful for deep infiltration and high-risk operations. As with almost all things, Malfian society has found a twisted and sinister application for somna in the form of elaborate murders and disappearances where a drugged user awakens to find himself buried alive or marooned on the notoriously perilous feral world of Dusk. An adulterated form of somna is used as a lacing agent for a particularly potent variety of obscura known as "black spiral", which so far has only turned up on Scintilla. This suggests that the narco-gangs in Hive Sibellus have come into some kind of reliable supply of somna, which has sparked all sorts of speculation and intrigue among the hive's enforcers and citizens. Many have thought that the enigmatic and behemoth chartist ship known as the _Misericord_ has some role to play, while others have whispered that the Lord Sector or even the Inquisition itself are involved.

Somna must be carefully measured and administered to a user by a trained medicae in order to receive the desired result. Dosing a user requires a second character to make a Difficult (-10) Medicae Test which takes about an hour for both characters. On a success the user enters into a state of apparent death for between one and twenty days (chosen by the character making the Medicae Test) - if the test is a failure then the duration is random (2d10 days), though the character making the Medicae Test is unaware of the failure (with potentially disastrous consequences!). A failure by four or more degrees results in a catastrophic reaction that kills the user, the death becoming quite real sometime before the user was to awaken.

Regardless of the outcome of the Medicae Test, a character under the effect of somna appears to be dead. Medicae or Awareness Tests made with an auspex, medispex, or similar device show the user as being dead, while Psychic Powers that can detect or identify living creatures simply fail to recognise the user. However, a successful Very Hard (-30) Medicae Test made only with the medicae's own senses - no other gear or equipment that grants a bonus may be used - can reveal the ruse.

A character can be awoken early from a somna-induced state by administering a stimm to the user's heart or a major artery, but this is an extremely dangerous action that can have lethal consequences. The somna user must succeed on a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test to wake up, in which case the drug's effect ends normally. Failure means that the stimm causes the user to suffer a fatal infarction, though to outside observers it simply appear to be a gauche attempt to revive a cadaver.

#### The Tears of the Dragon

Artificial psycho-viral infections, better known as "meme-viruses", are a brand of technowizardry that is only truly understood by the Adeptus Mechanicus, and the red-robed priests make extensive use of them as part of a broad array of psycho-conditioning both of their helots and servants as well as members of their own ranks. The most widely used meme-virus within the Priesthood is known as "The Tears of the Dragon" and is most commonly used on the elite Centurions of the Skitarii Tech-Guard as well as the most warlike of the Magos Ordinatos. Infection by the meme-virus results in the user being subjected to feverish recorded visions and senses of the worst horrors that the Mechanicus has borne witness to in its very long history. Some emerge with their minds irreparably broken, possibly making them candidates for mind-cleansing, or in the worst cases, servitor conversion. Those that retain their senses have demonstrated their ability to purge the frail trappings of human sanity and fear, bringing them closer to singularity with the calculating and rational perfection of the Machine God.

Once infected, the character must succeed on a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test or suffer 1d10+10 Insanity Points as the pre-programmed visions run amok in their minds. With a success the character gains the Fearless and Jaded talents - as well as the approval of their peers in the Mechanicus - but also permanently reduces their Fellowship by 1d10 points. Because a memevirus never actually leaves a character's mind, any attempts to re-infect oneself at a later date automatically fail.

#### Theosophist's Philtre

This strong and heady liquor is produced on Archaos, a hive world famed for its cultural affectation for philosophy. With a rich, syrupy complexion, the philtre's sweet and floral flavour is followed by an astringent aftertaste - the juxtaposition supposedly providing a good clarity for battling mental conundrums. Paradoxically, the stuff is actually forbidden on Archaos itself due to an ancient pre-Angevin law, but enforcement is pitifully lax - typically only in the event of one making too many enemies at the oratorium. Theosophist's philtre has broad appeal among the more cerebral nobles and other rich drinkers in the Calixis Sector, where it advertises the drinker's cultural affinity more than just his wealth. Whether or not it actually has mind-altering powers to give the drinker expanded lucidity, or if the drinker simply experiences a sense of mystique due to the bottle's curious existence, is debatable. 

#### Verita (Drug)

The very existence of this potent narcotic is unknown to most drug users, and because of its strong and singular effects, the powers that be - including the Inquisition's Calixian Conclave - are keen on keeping it that way. Verita is an incredibly powerful hallucinogenic substance that must be drunk to be effective. After ingesting it, the user's senses are slowly subdued by verita's profound psychotropic effects - his perception slowly shifts, revealing the cosmic interplay of fates and history, with some addicts claiming that they can "see through time", gaining insight to unknown truths and incredible visions. Most would assume that verita's gifts are simply an incredibly vivid hallucination, but investigators from Scintilla's ruling houses as well as the Inquisition have hypothesised that the drug may well bestow the user with immersive visions that transcend the mortal perception of time. As a result, the drug is incredibly illegal, with the act of distribution being deemed a Moral Threat and carrying the harshest of penalties. Verita's composition is totally unknown, and careful chem-analysis reveal a bewildering array of trace constituents that defy identification. The substance itself typically takes the form of a thick blue liquid in a sealed ampoule - if cracked open, a smell of unknown flowering blossoms mixed with subtle undertone of decay will permeate the room long after the drug has been swallowed.

A dose of verita takes about 20 minutes to become effective, after which the user finds himself slowly immersed in alien visions and sensations that can show all matters of mind blowing weirdness. For the duration of the drug' effect, these vivid perceptions impose a -20 penalty on all Perception-based Tests and reduce the user's Willpower by 10 points. Verita lasts for 3d10 hours, after which the user must succeed on a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test or else gain 1d5 Insanity Points from a vision that was particularly terrifying or unsettling. If the character gained any Insanity as a result of failing the Test they also have a 20% chance of gaining 1d5 Corruption Points as they take a little too much of their hallucinations to heart. Because of the incredibly vivid nature of verita induced visions, the GM may wish to award that character some form of insight or foreknowledge of future threats or events relevant to that character's own challenges or efforts.

Verita is addictive, but possesses a unique addiction mechanic. If a user ever spends more than 20 hours under the effect of one dose of verita he becomes addicted, suffering a gradually more debilitating malaise until he can witness more insight into future unknowns. The addict can function normally for a number of days equal to his Willpower Bonus, after which he suffers a cumulative -5 penalty to his mental Characteristics (Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship) each day he goes without another dose, up to a maximum of -20. It takes a full month of abstinence to overcome a verita addiction.

#### White Void (Drug)

White void is a notably popular drug that sends the user into a peacefully hazy state where they are comforted by nondescript feelings of beatific well-being. The stuff is fairly simple to make and appears to be derived entirely from synthetic medicinal compounds that can be easily acquired on just about any developed Imperial world. Unlike many drugs, white void cannot be taken on its own - the powdery product is typically dissolved in water into which a pack of lho-sticks are immersed. When the water dries out - evaporation works best, but it can be boiled in a pinch - the white void-laced lho sticks are smoked normally. Long-term usage of white void tends to cause discoloration of the eyes, eventually leaving the user's oculars totally colorless and appearing nothing more than black pupils on a vast expanse of white. White void is extremely addictive and can hook regular users with the utmost of ease, but it is no more deleterious to one's constitution than smoking regular lho-sticks.

Once smoked, white void takes 1d5+5 minutes to become effective. A character smoking a lho-stick laced with white void gains a +20 bonus on any Willpower-based Tests for 1d10 minutes. After the initial high expires, the user's improved mood and feelings of confidence still impart a +5 bonus on Tests made to resist Fear and Pinning for another 1d5 hours. When the drug completely wears off, the user finds himself left with a surly and dour attitude, suffering a -20 penalty to any Fellowship-based Tests for the same amount of time that he was under white void's effect.

A character who takes three or more doses of white void in a week long period must pass a Hard (-20) Willpower Test or become addicted, thereafter starting each day with on level of Fatigue that cannot be removed except by taking a dose. It takes three weeks of abstinence to overcome a white void addiction.

#### Zumthorian Greyve (Drug)

This drug was virtually unknown in the broader Calixis Sector until after the Tranch Insurrection, the flow of refugees and escaped mutants from that world settling on the lonely frontier planet Zumthor discovering "the Greyve" and helping spread it to nearby worlds. Made from mashed-up purplish flowers that grow like weeds, Greyve induces an incredibly powerful relaxing and sedative effect that seems to detach the user from the world around him. On a neural level, the user becomes shrouded in a thick fog that blots out most external stimuli. What's more, the drug appears to actually pass on some resistive effects to the user's biologics too, making them curiously resilient to physical stress and fatigue as well as blunt trauma. However, the user must exert great effort to do anything but laze about until he's "out of the Greyve", with most lacking the fortitude to do much more than idly hum or fiddle with their own anatomy. While fairly simple to manufacture, only limited amounts of prepared Greyve make it off Zumthor on a regular basis, and as a result it has a markedly higher street price than even the most potent obscura. Combined with its highly addictive qualities, trading in Greyve is a very lucrative business for the nacro-gangers cutthroat enough to engage in trafficking it and connected enough to obtain the stuff in the first place. On Zumthor itself, however, the prepared drug is worth only slightly more than a cup of recaf, with many more indolent citizens growing it in private plots for their own indulgence.

Depending on preparation, Zumthorian Greyve can be injected or smoked, becoming effective in 3d10 Rounds or 1d5 minutes, respectively. Its effects last for 2d5 hours, during which time the user becomes completely immune to Fatigue, Fear, Stunning, Pinning, and automatically succeeds on any Tests to resist Interrogation. Additionally, should the user sustain any Impact-based Critical Damage that requires a Toughness Test to resist, they gain a +20 bonus to that Test. However, the drug also reduces their Intelligence and Perception Characteristics by 30 for the duration, and they must succeed on a Hard (-30) Willpower Test any time they wish to take any actions other than loafing around or some other pointless idling.

If the user takes more than three doses of Zumthorian Greyve within a week of one another he must pass a Hard (-20) Willpower Test or become addicted. An addict can go up to 1d5-1 days (minimum 1) before starting to suffer withdrawals that gift them an irritable and easily agitated demeanour. Until the addict gets back "in the Greyve" they suffer a -10 penalty to Fellowship-based Skill Tests; additionally, any time the addict must make a Skill Test in a stressful situation, such as during combat, infiltration, or meeting with tedious people, they must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test or suffer a -10 penalty to the aforementioned Skill Test. It takes three weeks of abstinence to overcome a Greyve addiction.

[[#Primitive World Gear]]
[[#Infantry Gear]]
#### Arms Coffer

These heavy-duty lockers and cases are designed to safely transport weapons in noncombat situations, protecting their machine spirits from disgruntling conditions as well as an at tractive finish from being scuffed or beaten around. They tend to take the form of flat, oblong containers with reinforcement ribbing and sturdy latches and hinges that communicate a sense of durability - the insides are typically lined with polyfoam, rubber, or some other material that provides cushioning and impact resistance. An arms coffer includes the necessary hardware to attach locking mechanisms, be they simple tension-shackles or advanced gene-locks, and most form an airtight seal to protect the weapons within from the environment as well as pilfering hands.

With some variances, an arms coffer can typically carry either two Basic weapons or six Pistols weapons and "enough" ammunition for the same, along with other sundry items such as a maintenance kit, bottles of sacred machine oil, removable gun sights, and so forth. Unless drastically overloaded, an arms coffer will float if immersed in most liquids.

#### Auspex/Scanner

"Auspex" is a general term for a category of sensor and scanning devices that can detect energy emissions, motion and movement, and

biological life signs. Auspex units come in a range of sizes, with smaller types being able to fit in a modest belt pouch with a wire connection to a wrist- or visor-mounted display while heavier vehicular models might be the size of a man's torso. Larger auspex units generally have a greater scanning distance and can more easily detect hidden objects. Though eminently useful during exploration and scouting endeavours, an auspex must be carefully manipulated in order to achieve the desired effect - a unit whose machine spirit is not adequately mollified will often report the presence of nonexistent objects or threats.

Common handheld auspex units take the form of a single housing about the size of a large dataslate or a two-piece affair with a cable-connected display. An auspex can be used in an automatic scan mode or can be manually activated to do more intensive examination of the area. In automatic mode, an auspex grants the user a +20 bonus to Opposed Awareness Tests against other characters or creatures using the Concealment Skill or benefitting from environmental concealment such as smoke or brush. In manual mode, the user must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test, with success revealing the presence of living creatures and most types of weapons, moving objects larger than common

insects, and potentially other hidden dangers such as radiation or toxic gases in the air. Should the user fail his Test, the auspex may return a partial result, nothing at all, or "false positives" as it identifies threats that don't actually exist. A handheld auspex typically has a range of about 50 meters, though walls more than 50 centimeters thick, special shielding materials, and background interference from heavy machinery or dedicated jamming equipment can degrade or totally block an auspex's scanning.

#### Auto-Quill

An esoteric though undoubtedly useful device, auto-quills are a boon to adepts and anyone else who must deal with written records for any period of time. Auto-quills typically take the form of small metallic or wooden cabinets large enough to feed reams of paper or rolls of parchment through, with a runeboard or keypad attached to one end not unlike a personal cogitator. The other end feeds the paper in where one or two pairs of small servo-arms convert the user's keystrokes into written words and prose on the chosen medium. Using an auto-quill requires some training before useful copies and prints can be made - the user must become very judicious in his finger-tapping as an auto-quill happily duplicates errors just as well, and there of minor rites that must be fore using the device in order to ensure reliable transfer. Once a user has "gotten the stroke of it", however, many wonder how they wrote at all before using one.

A character using an auto-quill gains a +10 bonus to Trade (Copyist) Test in any situation where the written material can be used with an auto-quill. a Good Craftsmanship auto-quill grants a +20 bonus as well as producing written text that will fool all but the most discerning eye into thinking it was written by hand.

#### Cast Spray

As the name suggests, this handy metallic can contains an aerosol spray that hardens into a sturdy and impact-resistant mass suitable for bracing a broken bone. The spray is also laced with procoagulants and antibacterial agents which help greatly in preventing infection in perilous compound fractures. Cast spray is frequently added to medikits to improve the capability of the medic to treat broken bones, but can also be carried and used by itself as its application is fairly intuitive.

A medic using cast spray allows the victim of a broken bone to roll twice and choose the more favorable result when making the Toughness Test to retain the limb (see _Dark Heresy_, page 211 for more information on Broken Limbs and their treatment). It also provides a +20 bonus to any Tests made to stop Blood Loss, though it may leave the character partly immobilised even if they don't have a broken bone at all. One can of cast spray is sufficient for three applications, after which it is usually discarded. Using cast spray is a Full Action.

#### Cognomen

A "Cognomen" is the official Administratum designation for standardised forms of citizen identification used on most developed worlds in the Calixis Sector. These take a variety of forms ranging from thin plastek cards with raised text and possibly an etched pict or other visual aid to small implants in the user's hand or arm that can be read by a compatible scanner from a short distance away. The most common variety are used on hive worlds and invariably take the form of a small metal card with a unique series of punches removed from the upper half while the lower half bears the insignia of the issuing hive, guild, or Adepta that the owner belongs to. A hiver's cognomen is a frighteningly important item - depending on the world and the citizen's specific condition, the cognomen may well be the owner's entire life and legal identity.

Authorisation to inhabit a block or dormitory, be served in refectories and cafetoriums, and even simply to enter their workplace and conduct labour are all granted by the flash or swipe of a cognomen, making losing one a terrifying process. Without any proof of their status or identity, a hiver could well face starvation, abandonment, arrest, being forced to recidivism, or - possibly worst of all - seeking refuge in the underhive. Procedures exist for a hiver to petition for a replacement cognomen, but the length of time involved can sometimes be astronomical when compared to the immediate needs of food and housing. Because of their great importance, leading to expressions like "you are your 'cog'", there is a thriving black market in stolen and fraudulent cognomen, with the price reaching up into the thousands for more comfortable occupations (manufactorum foremen, hab supervisors and public inspectors tend to be the most highly sought). Of course, the penalty for such impropriety can be steep. 

#### Combi-Tool

Combi-Tools are immeasurably serviceable pieces of equipment that improve their owner's ability to manipulate many different types of machines and other forms of tech. A combi-tool can be found in innumerable patterns and shapes, but the most common variety take the form of a sturdy metal box that scissors open to reveal a plethora of attached implements that can be folded out and put to work. Combi-tools will typically include a full set of bits and drivers, small-size sockets and adjustable wrench heads, pliers and tongs, several blades, probes, a current detector, magnetic attractor, accessor-tines for use with cogitator maintenance, and probably a few other attachments as well. Outside of the Mechanicus, where ornate combi-tools are given to initiate enginseers as a mark of merit and accomplishment, it is likely that most owners of a combi-tool aren't sure what at least one of its attachments is meant to be used for. Regardless of their type, however, a combi-tool will invariably have at least one reinforced and hardened strike-plate for the sole purpose of thwacking sacred runes to awaken a machine's slumbering spirit.

A character using a combi-tool gain a +10 bonus to Tech-Use and Trade (Technomat) Tests when working with Imperial tech and mechanisms, though they may also be compatible with machinery of unknown or xeno provenance as well. Note that a combi-tool can't be used in all situations, and generally requires the user to have both hands free to manipulate the combi-tool and the item it is being used on.

#### Compass/Orienter

A small device typically capable of fitting into a pocket, a compass or orienter is commonly expense - many ar tuned and calibrated to look for a planet's magnetic pole, giving the user an absolute and constant direction to aid in navigation. A compass is often thought of as a valuable tool for covering open ground, but it can be just as useful for finding one's way in the labyrinthine interior of a hive city's lower depths, and certain orienters are produced to point towards a voidship's bridge or bow for similar purposes when delving into seldom-used decks.

When used in conjunction with a map or personal geographic knowledge a compass or orienter grants a +10 bonus to Navigation (Surface) Tests made while travelling. At the GM's discretion it may grant other bonuses in certain situations as well.

#### Data-Slate

Data-slates are a nearly ubiquitous sight across much of the Imperium, and it is often said that there are likely more styles and patterns of these humble devices than there are worlds under the God-Emperor's gaze. In general, a data-slate is designed to display some form of media typically text or graphs, but more advanced models can also be used to render vox or vidrecordings, with some costly patterns even incorporating a hololith or projector. The core components of a data-slate belong to well understood STCs and as a result they can be produced in staggering quantities with minimal expense - many are used simply because they're more durable than paper. Data-slates are off of an internal charge cell - depending on the quality of the slate's construction, a data-slate may be able to be used for days or weeks at a time before it must be connect to a power source to replenish its reserves. In most cases, a data-slate retains the information it carried even when it has no power. The functions and utility of a data-slate can typically be categorized on the same scale as Item Craftsmanship, but even then there can be considerable variance:

**Poor:** A simple mono task example typically encountered in an inexpensive plastic or soft alloy housing. These very basic slates are only designed to display only text, and by and large cannot be used to do anything but display the data that is initially printed into them. Some can be repurposed later, but most use cheap "single use" data-coils that can only be written to once.

**Common:** These slates appear to be similar to the Poor Craftsmanship version described above, but have denser data-coils that are doubled up in the slightly thicker housing. This allows the contained text to be cleared out and filled again when connected to a cogitator, dataloom, or other device capable of recording text. Even cheap slates usually have enough memory to store quite a bit of text on it, with some models able to store an entire volume of the Psalms of Saint Drusus in a package that can be slipped into a pants pocket. For an additional 10 thrones, data-slates of Common Craftsmanship (or better) can be obtained with a built-in microvox that can receive data from the public info-nets that exist in some grander hive cities.


**Good:** No longer a simple device to merely store text, a Good Craftsmanship data-slate is capable of storing and replaying picts, vids and voxlogs as well, making it a truly multipurpose device. The higher cost and workmanship is typically represented by a shiny alloy housing that is often finished with brass or copper around the edges. Data-slates of this type tend to be larger than their lesser brethren, boasting a large and clear screen that's about the size of a roll of parchment. A minority are the inverse, however, with high-quality components that allow the slate to be barely larger than a deck of cards - this style is often favored by those that must travel light, though the tiny screen can be hard to read at times.

**Best:** Top-of-the-line patterns begin to blur the line between data-slate and personal cogitator, and are often constructed with a finely lacquered wooden housing, though brushed or chromed metal examples can also be found. These data-slates are both durable and functional, often containing built-in pict- or vidstealers and almost always including a vox pickup for taking verbal notations. A data-slate of this quality might also have such features as a gene-lock so only assigned users can access its information, an emergency purge feature that completely wipes the slate's data-coils, and even a miniature thermal-writer that can transfer text or picts stored on the slate to a small-size roll of special heat-reactive paper. For twice the cost, a Best Craftsmanship data-slate may be fitted with a hololith display or projector suitable for displaying its contents to an audience.

#### Glow-globe/Lamp Pack

 
Most men are naturally afraid of the dark, and for good reason. Naturally blind in such conditions, a man is easy prey for savage beasts that stalk in darkness, not to mention terrain and environmental pitfalls that exist in a plethora of forms across feral and developed worlds. Lamp packs and glow-globes are a common remedy to this problem, allowing the bearer to bring light and (usually) safety with him into darkened areas. Typical lamp packs are self-contained cylindrical or conical housings made of metal or plastek with a transparent area so that a gas-filled bulb, fluoro-tube, or chemical flame can shine outward in all directions. A glow-globe works off of the same principle but tends to be more spherical with a magnetic or adhesive base so that it can literally be stuck to an available surface.

This sample example provides illumination in a 10 to 15 meter radius for about twelve hours before needing to be recharged or refuelled, though larger and heavier examples might project light out significantly further.

#### Grapnel

When you need to reach a vertically distant area or object, a grapnel is often the quickest and easiest way to make the ascent. The most common examples used on developed worlds (and by explorers on regional backwaters) take the form of a crossbow or gas-gun with a metallic frame that fires a hooked or magnetic anchor trailing a long length of wire (most have a spool that will go about 100 meters). Once the grapnel has secured itself to the desired location, the firer can climb the line or winch himself up using the grapnel's own spool mechanism. Grapnels are commonly thought of as being a tool for explorers blazing trails through perilous feral jungles and mountains, but they are just as commonly used by manufactorum workers to ascend tall gantries or the support ribbing of industrial vaults, while particularly bold recidivists (and assassins...) have been more rarely known to use a grapnel to make their way up the exterior of hive spires, sometimes for several levels or more, to reach an exposed balcony or window belonging to their target.

Firing a grapnel does not require a Test unless the user wishes to hit a specific target, such as a single outcropping, pipe, or window ledge, in which case the user makes a Ballistic Skill Test which can benefit from the Aim Action. A grapnel has a range of 50m but cannot be fired at Long or Extreme Range of 100m. A character can climb the extended cable, but the difficulty of the Climb Test is one step higher than if they were using knotted rope due to the smoothness of the cable. The grapnel's user can also employ the winch to ascend, in which case he can reel himself up at a rate of 5 meters per Round. No Tests are necessary to climb in this way, though the user must keep both hands on the grapnel unless he is using it in conjunction with a clip/drop harness.

#### Igniter

Whether it is used for starting a campsite fire, re-lighting a snuffed pilot flame in a boiler or cooker, destroying sensitive information written on paper, or simply to start off a relaxing lho-stick, the ability to carry fire in one's pocket is an immediate distinction between advanced and feral worlds in the Imperium. Igniters are the chosen form on most developed Imperial worlds as they exhibit key qualities of ease of use, cheapness of manufacture, and reliability of action. Most igniters take the form of a small metallic or plastek box with or without a lid or cap that makes use of a flammable liquid fuel or Promethium aerosol to create a stable flame. The make and style vary widely on individual worlds, much less an entire sector of space, and some aficionados have been known to amass staggering collections of all shapes and sizes. Depending on the style, an igniter may require the user to keep a stud or switch depressed to produce flame, or it may continue to burn until snuffed or its fuel is exhausted.

#### Injector

Many types of drugs - medicinal, augmentive, or illicit - are intended to be absorbed directly into the user's flesh and blood. Some of these substances, such as stimm, are already prepared and ready to be used, but others must be used in conjunction with some type of device to introduce the drug into the user's blood stream. Injectors are a variety of tools and implements meant to do just that.

##### Autojector

Most combat drugs tend to be used with autojectors due to their ease of use. An autojector resembles a plastek tube with an opening on one end that contains a spring loaded needle. Once armed by depressing a stud, an autojector is used by jabbing the open end against the body - the sudden stop causes the needle to be deployed and the drug to be administered. An autojector can be used through clothing but can't penetrate any kind of armor normally, a character can simply jab himself or an ally through a gap or space, but a character in sealed armor will have to remove at least one piece (typically the helmet) to present an injection site. Using a drug with an autojector is a Full Action, but the user can attempt to reduce this time to a Half Action by succeeding on a Weapon Skill Test (gaining the usual +30 bonus for attacking an Unaware target, assuming the recipient is willing).

##### Hypo-Spray

Though somewhat bulkier than other injection methods, hypo-sprays are a novel and efficient way to quickly administer drugs to a recipient. The small gun-like device uses a pressurized gas canister to atomize and then jettison the drug into the user. The hypo-spray's holder simply presses the device against the recipient's skin and pulls a trigger - the high speed of the spray penetrates the skin while leaving only an irritated circle instead of a tiny wound, which can be an crucial consideration if the user is operating in a foetid or contaminated environment. A hypo-spray can be loaded with up to six doses of the same drug; Good Craftsmanship versions can take up to six different drugs and make use of a rotary feed mechanism to select between the loaded capsules. Using a drug with a hypo-spray is a Half Action.

##### Skin Patch

Unlike most injectors, skin patches appear to be completely innocuous items whose true purpose may be lost on the average Imperial citizen. A skin patch takes the form of a square of thin transparent film about 10 centimeters on a side, and are most often stored in a disposable wrapper. Once removed, a skin patch is applied to an area of bare skin where it sticks in place - the drug is actually contained within the patch itself and leaches into the user's bloodstream by infiltrating through their skin. Very basic skin patches begin administering the drug immediately, but most are bio-attuned to retain their dose until activated by the user. This is typically done by applying a firm pressure to the entire patch - if applied properly, skin patches can be worn under most types of armor, with the user simply compressing the area in a prescribed fashion to activate the patch. Skin patches are especially useful for those wearing heavy armor or void suits - an autojector is typically out of the question - but can also be appreciated by men with a particular distaste for needles. A character may apply a skin patch as a Full Action - once applied, a skin patch retains the drug for 1d5-2 days (minimum 1), after which it dries out and begins to peel off. As a Half Action, the user can activate the skin patch at any time during this period.

##### Syrette

Simple to a point, this type of injector uses a thin needle attached to a tube that contains the drug. Pressure, whether by squeezing the tube or pressing down on a plunger, forces the drug into the recipient's flesh. Syrettes are cheap and effective, but have to be used on an area of bare skin, making them somewhat clumsy in dangerous situations (such as combat). A syrette is typically thrown away after being used, though some types can be refilled and used again. Re-used syrettes are commonly seen in the employ of addicts of illicit drugs, and can often lead to infections. For the same reason, a syrette can be dangerous if used in a contaminated environment - most medics, given enough time, will sanitise the injection site with alcohol or a similar disinfectant first. Using a drug with a syrette is a Full Action.

#### Magnoculars

Through the magic of paired sets of glass or crystal focusing lenses, a set of magnoculars can allow inquisitive eyes to substantially magnify distant objects, allowing for closer inspection or surveillance. Magnoculars typically require a notable amount of adjustment and fine-tuning in order to present a clear image, but once the user has become familiar with the item's propensities, they can be an extremely helpful piece of kit. In general, a set of magnoculars can make a specific point anywhere from four to ten times as large to the viewer's perception. Agents and inspectors typically make use of magnoculars to more closely examine a distant item or area that requires their attentions, while explorers and hunters utilize the piece to scan for possible paths ahead and hiding or stalking prey. They are also commonly used in military situations as well, though an observer must always take cognizance that magnoculars only present a very small area at once, potential blinding their user to activity at their flanks Most types of magnoculars simply make thing appear larger, but rarer and more costly version and patterns may boast other ancillary features.

A character actively using magnoculars may be entitled to Awareness Tests to see things that others without enhanced vision cannot, and can pick out greater detail of far-off objects or areas. In addition, Good Craftsmanship magnoculars can also determine the distance of a sighted object (out to a maximum of 1 kilometer) and can textually identify a range of common objects and targets  informing the viewer when they are looking at men, vehicles, machinery, beasts, an so forth. These additional qualities may grant bonuses to certain Skill Tests in a given situation, though what benefits may be derive are left to the discretion of the GM.

#### Manacles

This type of basic restraint has been used in some form or other since the Age of Terra and is just as effective today as it has been for countles millennia. In their most basic form, manacles are sturdy metallic cuffs linked together by a chain or cable that scissor open and then latch shut around a prisoner's wrists - depending on the user's skill, a prisoner can be made quit compliant, or at least easier to transport. Tried and true styles of manacles typically use a mechanical lock whose key is held by the captor, while more novel or esoteric versions might use a combination, gene-lock, or simple tension that can't be loosened by the prisoner. Manacles are commonly thought of as the purview of bounty hunters and enforcers, but they also have a calling among sinister individuals and groups with more nefarious intentions. Various styles of manacles, including those hailing from worlds of varying tech levels, can typically be categorized on the same scale as Item Craftsmanship.

**Poor:** Basic, no-frills designs that keep a prisoner's hands together and not much else. Manacles of this type are typically referred to as "hand clamps" due to their simplistic construction - some use the familiar lock-and-key arrangement, but many make use of simple bolts and pins that, in theory, a prisoner can't reach to pop out. Aside from cheap restraints, this type of manacle can also represent examples used in feudal world dungeons. 

Manacles of this type impose a -10 penalty on Contortionist or Security Tests to escape from them, and can be burst if the prisoner succeeds at three successive Hard (-20) Strength Tests.

**Common:** Often seen in the belts and pockets of hive enforcers and other heavies, manacles of this type are generally considered to be "good enough" for most duties. A solid case-hardened frame contains a ratcheting cuff that securely clicks in place around the prisoner's wrists with a high-tensile chain connecting each manacle, making them very hard to force or break open. The locks themselves are invariably used with a small key that is unique to each pair of cuffs, and the keyhole is deliberately placed to be difficult for an enterprising prisoner to attempt to pick. 

Manacles of this type increase the penalty to Security Tests made to escape to -30 and require five successive Very Hard (-30) Strength Tests to be broken open.

**Good:** This type of manacle is usually defined from its lesser iterations by the use of a more complex and escape-resistant locking mechanism. Instead of a typical lock-and-key device, these manacles can be found with more advanced mechanisms - gene-lock circuits are particularly popular as only the manacles' owner can trigger their release, but some more ambitious patterns use a cogitator-controlled lock that can be programmed via a special data slate. This data-slate can deactivate the manacles at any time, but can also set up a specific time period or interval where the manacles will unlock by themselves. A built-in microvox link allows the data-slate to communicate with the manacles from a distance of up to 10 meters.

Manacles of this type impose a -40 penalty to Security Tests made to escape, and the Test takes twice as long to attempt.

**Best:** Also known as "magnacles", these finely crafted restraints are about as effective as wrist restraints get. Magnacles, as the name suggests, make heavy use of magnetism in their operations - the locking mechanism of the shackle is magnetic, and the cuffs themselves are designed to clamp to one another, making them exceptionally difficult to escape. All the same, they can be released almost instantly by merely pressing a stud on a small pocket-sized "clicker" which deactivates the magnetic fields. Aside from attaching to one another, an individual magnacle can also be stuck to just about any ferrous surface, such as the interior of a Repressor vehicle or prison cell, making them a highly versatile tool as well. Magnacles are most commonly used by hardened Arbitrators dispensing Imperial law - a single trooper will often carry a pair in his personal equipment, with a dozen or more kept as standard in a Repressor's cargo bins.

Magnacles impose a -40 penalty on Contortionist and Security Tests made to escape, and each Test takes at least three times as long as usual to attempt. A character can force a magnacle open by succeeding on five successive Hellish (-60) Strength Tests.

#### Mantle-Shrine

While resplendent to behold and humbling to enter, grand churches and cathedrals dedicated to the God-Emperor of Man are sorely lacking in portability. When a visit to a sanctioned chapel or church isn't possible, faithful Imperial citizens can turn to an easily movable mantle-shrine to ensure the Emperor hears their prayers. Mantle-shrines are common devotional items that vary greatly in quality and workmanship, but most follow a fairly standard format of a triptych case made of wood, alloy, or flakboard. Fully folded, a mantle-shrine can be carried around like a piece of luggage - when needed, most shrines can deploy a set of folding legs and then be snapped open to reveal their ecclesiastical interiors. Traditional mantle-shrines contain a larger center partition with a painted or relief icon of the Emperor - the right panel invariably depicts Saint Drusus, while the left may feature scenes of religious portents, well-known lay members of the Church, or other images of the maker's choosing. The base folds out and includes small troughs for incense and charms, holders for candles, and a tackboard for votive slips. Ornate mantle-shrines can be obtained from skilled artisans, but the vast majority - even those used by men of means - are made in pilgrim shantytowns on Scintilla's Hive Tarsus. The Ecclesiarchy rewards these devoted souls with a stipend for expenses and shelter, then distributes the mantle-shrines across the sector where countless faithful citizens can venerate the Emperor through devotional displays that were assembled and blessed under the searing light of the Golden Cathedral itself.

 ##### Missionary Shrine
 
 Travelling missionaries will almost always carry a sturdy metallic mantle-shrine that is often noticeably heavier than the types worshiped by common citizens. Depending on which tradition one follows, this extra mass is variously to visit a small measure of the Emperor's burden on the missionary's posture, or simply "because it's so full of mercy". The truth is somewhat less inspirational - aside from being more solidly built to withstand the rigors of travel, the heavy construction is of immediate utility for clobbering heathen scummers and bandits that would dare desecrate a missionary's holy work. 

#### Medikit

Medikits are an essential part of any combat medic's arsenal and are frequently employed by chirurgeons and medicae making "hab calls" as well. A medikit will vary considerably in appearance and utility, but the general purpose is to provide a concise and compact set of medical tools, chem sets, drugs, and other gear to improve the medicae's ability to treat injured and sickened victims in field situations. Medikits used by soldiers and Guardsmen will typically come with collapsible rubberised fabric bundle that can be easily attached to a gear harness or belt, while a chirurgeon might carry a much more polished set in a leather case that will hold its shape and the implements within during treatment procedures.

A medikit provides a +20 bonus to Medicae Tests made to administer First Aid, to stop Blood Loss, and in the treatment of broken limbs (including amputations). A medikit typically has enough supplies to be used ten times before it is depleted. If the medic has access to reserves of medicinal supplies, such as at a hospice or treatment centre, a depleted medikit can be "refilled" for half the listed price of a new one. If the medic succeeds on a Medicae Test with three or more degrees of success he only uses half as many supplies as usual thanks to greater efficiency and avoidance of precautionary excess. See the Medicae skill description on page 233 of _The Inquisitor's Handbook_ for a more detailed explanation and further rules.

##### Advanced Medikit

Aside from the usual supplies and tools, this medikit includes a compact "guidance cogitator" that can offer instructions to the medic, allowing those who are not skilled in first aid to still act in a lifesaving capacity. Easy-to-follow pict-grams are provided as well to facilitate quick diagnosis of common conditions. Though helpful for the average citizen or soldier, the added bulk and "juvie" nature of an advanced medikit's extra features make them rare sights in the hands of a trained healer.

In addition to functioning as a normal medikit, an advanced medikit allows the user to make Medicae Tests even if he is not trained in that skill.
##### Healer's Kit

Less developed worlds of the Imperium usually have at least a modicum of medical theory and surgical practice, which are often taught by secretive guilds and academic schools. Feudal medicine is far less advanced than that practiced on fully-vested Imperial worlds, but it can be surprisingly effective at treating common maladies. A feudal healer will typically use live leeches to staunch bleeding, sharp needles and fine thread to suture wounds closed, and bottles of alcohol and herbal tinctures to clean injuries and relax pain. Other accoutrements would usually include rolls of fabric bandages, metallic tongs and clamps, scalpels, probes, and a wire saw to quickly amputate diseased or crushed limbs. While kit of this type would be logically found on feudal and other less-developed worlds, it can also be used to represent cheap or improvised medical tools and supplies used on the fringes of Imperial society - for example, replacing the needles and thread with a handheld staple-fastener or noncaustic binding glues.

A healer's kit provides a +10 bonus to Medicae Tests made to administer First Aid, to stop Blood Loss, and in the treatment of broken limbs (including amputations). A healer's kit has enough supplies to be used 1d10+5 times before it is exhausted, though replacement supplies can be easily scrounged up in most inhabited areas.

#### Micro-bead

Short for "microphone-ear-bead", micro-beads are a common form of field communication among soldiers, professional mercenaries, and other groups that focus on complex tactics. They are less heavily used outside of military and paramilitary circles, but aren't unheard of either, often gracing the lobes of manufactorum foremen and labor-gang supervisors. A micro-bead is designed for hands-free vocal communication over short distances - the wearer is able to speak with other characters wearing a micro-bead and hear their replies. Individual micro-beads operate on a unique vox-frequency that can be shared with multiple participants with a range of about a kilometer. If properly configured, a micro-bead can be "trunked" through a vox-caster as well, giving the microbead's wearer the ability to speak at much longer distances. Because of their small size, micro-beads are prone to receiving "unhelpful" interference from heavy machinery and more powerful comm-links, and their signal range can be considerably degraded by certain materials or simple density of objects between them. A micro-bead's Craftsmanship has further effects on its use and utility:

**Poor:** Often composed of a bulky headset with a movable microphone, cheap micro-beads typically do not even mount the communications device itself in the headgear. The antenna and receiver unit take the form of a separate device about the size of a pack of lho-sticks that is typically carried in a vest pocket or pouch, with a wire feed connecting the headset. This type of micro-bead is usually found in noncombat uses where its extra mass and clunky nature aren't problematic.

A Poor Craftsmanship micro-bead weighs 1 kg and imposes a -5 penalty to any sound-based Awareness or Perception Tests the wearer makes in any Round in which he also uses the micro-bead to communicate.

**Common:** These micro-beads are typical of those used in the Imperial Guard and similar circles, and can sometimes be found permanently integrated into a flak helmet. The stand-alone types are composed of a metallic or plastek hook that sits around the user's earlobe with a small probe that fills the ear canal to allow the wearer to hear his allies in relative privacy. A microphone is provided on a thin boom that can be folded or collapsed when not in use - if properly adjusted, the user can whisper into the boom and still be heard clearly by his allies.

**Good:** Lighter and more comfortable to wear, high-grade micro-beads dispense with most of the external housing, leaving behind a very thin frame that fits behind the user's ear. The entire body of the micro-bead acts as an antenna which allows it to be made much smaller, and the microphone is reduced to a tiny sphere on a thin memory wire that can be easily re-positioned as the wearer needs. In addition to speaking aloud, a trained user can make use of a special micro-patch affixed to the side of his neck to communicate sub-vocally - the mic-patch interprets vibration and tensing of the user's neck and throat into speech, allowing him to "speak" while appearing to be silent, though careful observation can reveal subtle movements of the neck muscles.

A Good Craftsmanship micro-bead allows the user to speak to his allies without making any verbal noise as long as he has any one Ciphers skill. The micro-bead translates this sub-vocal communication into spoken words for those listening in on the micro-bead's frequency.

**Best:** A top-of-the-line micro-bead broadly its lesser peer but is even more resembles complex, the thin frame containing hundreds of meters of hair-like circuitry. A complex codecipher algorithm is applied to all transmissions between these micro-beads, making it much more difficult for prying ears to listen in on any conversations that may be transpiring. Though theoretically secure against eavesdropping, the paranoid users of encrypted micro-beads will often communicate in verbal code all the same just in case. Micro-beads of this type are most commonly used by agents and infiltrators who cannot risk being exposed, but especially nefarious recidivists and gang lords are known to communicate with them as well, much to the frustration of enforcers or Arbitrators trying to edge in.

A Best Craftsmanship micro-bead is identical to a Good Craftsmanship model in terms of use, but imposes a -30 penalty to Tech-Use Tests made as part of attempts to jack or bug the linked micro-beads with other devices.
#### Multikey

Though it is an honest utility item that is immediately useful for all matters of maintenance and social needs, a multikey is often thought of as a tool of burglary and theft. Many types of Imperial locks and security mechanisms work off of similar, or sometimes even identical, components and layouts - a multikey can interface with common patterns of mechanical and semi-mechanical locks, giving a skilled handler the ability to "finesse" a lock the rest of the way open. In an overbuilt habstack or industrial vault teeming with locked access hatches and cable-snake tunnels, a technomat armed with a multikey can be the difference between normal operations and functions grinding to a halt as block supervisors fumble through rotary files of keys and cards looking for the right one - they are also eminently useful for the salvation of citizens that have locked themselves out of their habs, and for the wealthier among them, personal vehicles. Of course, with the ability to open locks with relative ease using a metallic tool no bigger than a deck of cards, one can see how more paranoid citizens might believe a multikey holder could have less than honorable intentions as well.

A character using a multi-key gains a +30 bonus to Security Tests made to open most types of Imperial locks. Rare, unusual, or superior types of locks may reduce this bo mpletely negate it altogether - in general, the user is aware of whether or not his multikey will be useful or not through quick visual inspection.

#### Pict Recorder

A pict recorder is a fairly common device meant to matriculate still or live media. The technology to make these devices is well understood, but most require a significant amount of rare metals and precisely engineered components in their construction - this puts their cost above what most citizens could afford for any kind of recreational or entertainment purpose. Pict recorders are used in a battery of applications, including both covert and overt surveillance, inspections of manufactured products and equipment, and the recording of expeditions and discoveries - some more eccentric explorers and questing Magi have been known to include monotask servitors or servoskulls in their retinue solely to record their exploits for posterity. Pict-recorders come in a range of formats and styles - their capabilities and functions can be roughly categorized using the same rules as Item Craftsmanship:

**Poor:** Basic and cheap pict recorders are only capable of taking still monochrome picts, which are captured on cellulose strips that must undergo chemical processing before they can be viewed. For-hire inquiry agents tend to make use of these simple devices to obtain visual evidence of their target's misdeeds.

**Common:** More complex and sophisticated pict recorders are fully capable of taking down live-action vids as well as still picts, both of which are recorded in a subtractive color scheme that reproduces - with decent accuracy a true depiction of what the device sees. A pict recorder of this type can store a hundred or more picts or several hours of vid-recording on physical memory-coils within the recorder's housing. Once full, the media within can be sent to a compatible data-slate, cogitator, or other storage device for later review.

**Good:** Higher quality pict recorders produce picts and vids with sharper clarity and definition. Many also include a small screen on the device's housing that allows the user to view picts or vids that have already been taken, allowing them to inspect and cycle through their handiwork. This quality lets the user determine if any re-takes are necessary while the object of attention is still at hand, which can be immeasurably useful.

**Best:** Showing their top quality in both workmanship and the media produced, mastercrafted pict recorders can store a staggering amount of picts or vids through the use of liquid data medium that is contained in pressurized internal vessels. These pict recorders can be used in most lighting conditions and are the only types that return visual feeds sharp enough to be translated into full-scale hololith projections.

#### Polygum

This miraculous substance is the sole export of the world of Ganf Magna, and while its properties seem to defy logical explanation, its utility is vast beyond question. According to popular iteration, polygum was accidentally discovered when frontiersmen, waging a punitive expedition against the feral Orks that still trouble Ganf Magna today, blew open ancient trees with errant gunfire. The thick sap that emerged formed a rubbery, stretchy compound after coming in contact with scrubby lichen that grow on the tree's exterior. Even after being removed from the tree, the wads of gummy stuff demonstrate incredible elasticity and adhesive qualities - closer inspection has revealed that the polygum has an antibacterial property as well, creating even more uses for the marvelous substance. Polygum can be stretched and shaped to form waterproof cloaks, mantles, and tarps; readily serves as a sling for a broken or sprained limb; could improvise a litter if attached to parallel rods; is perfectly capable of holding damaged machinery components together until a more permanent fix is possible; keeps water and moisture out of leaky housings for equipment; and can even be used to squeeze shut a bleeding wound. It may be easier to question what can't be done with polygum attempt to create a comprehensive list of its possible applications. In order to retain "freshness", polygum must be stored in fairly small quantities in wooden containers - these handling characteristics lead to its fairly high cost on the open market, even though the stuff literally "grows on trees" on its world of origin.

Polygum can be used for a variety of situations where a waterproof putty-like material could be employed. A character with the Medicae skill can use a ball of polygum to immediately end Blood Loss being suffered by himself or another character. Polygum can generally be reused after being unstuck and returned to its original container, but exposure to substances with a high iron content - such as blood - causes it to become brittle and crumble the next time someone tries to reshape it.
#### Salvation Auger
Salvation augers are pocket-sized devices that "sniff" the owner's immediate whereabouts in order to provide warning of hazardous environmental conditions. Designed to be both portable and easy to use, a salvation auger is typically flipped on when the wearer enters an area of suspect status, after which it is usually worn around the neck or on a belt. When the salvation auger's scan-nodes detect harmful radiation, airborne toxins, or other atmospheric hazards, the auger warns the user with a variety of cues and indications. Salvation augers are most commonly employed by hivers - decrepit and dilapidated expanses of Imperial hive cities can generate a plethora of noxious and lethal conditions, such as accumulations of radioactive vapour and virulently poisonous plant and fungal growths. An expedition down to the underhive, or reclamator endeavours into disaster-felled districts, may take all necessary precautions to avoid physical pitfalls and survive encounters with creatures or violent denizens, but neglecting to protect oneself against environmental hazards can be just as fatal. Though less common, salvation augers are also carried by explorers uncovering ancient ruins and architecture on distant worlds, as well as naval armsmen delving down into the abandoned decks of great voidships. 

A salvation auger produces a visual or audio warning when the wearer enters into an area that is contaminated with dangerous levels of radiation, toxic or poisonous gases or particles, and other forms of environmental hazards. Good Craftsmanship salvation augers can provide more information than just the presence of danger - the user can attempt an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test to manipulate the device into reporting the exact type and concentration of the hazard.

#### Screamer

A common and typically quite effective security device, "screamer" is a broad term used to describe a plethora of devices that are designed to make an audible alert when its perimeter is breached. A screamer is about the size of a can of grox hash and will sometimes include a magnetic strip or a sturdy stake to anchor it to available surfaces. The device uses a simple motion tracker, aural sensor, and thermal scanner to locate and identify the presence of potential enemies. A small cogitator stack processes the information and triggers an ear shattering alarm that can be heard up to a kilometer away. A screamer includes ten ident-tokens that can be handed out to allies - anyone wearing one in an open location causes the screamer to politely ignore their presence.

A character wishing to set a screamer must make a **Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test**. If successful, the screamer activates and begins acting as a warder over the nearby area, making Awareness Tests as though it had a Perception of 75. A screamer watches over an area with a 30 meter radius, adding 5 meters for every degree of success on the setter's Tech-Use Test. Should the Test fail, the screamer appears to set properly, but some malfunction of its machine spirit (or the character not pressing the right button) reduces its Perception to 10 - most experienced explorers make sure to test a screamer's function (often by throwing a large rock or stick or some such object) to ensure that it has activated properly. Disarming a screamer requires an Easy (+30) Tech-Use Test, with failure likely causing the screamer to issue its horrendous racket when the user attempts to move it from its perch. A screamer can be left set for up to 5 days before its internal power cell needs to be recharged (this can be done with any common power source that would charge a lasgun's charge pack, open flame excluded).

#### Stab-light

This handheld device is designed to project a sharp, coherent beam of light out to a considerable distance, allowing its wielder to banish darkness from a specified point of aim. Compared to a lamp pack, a stab-light is smaller and handier with a greater effective range, but it can only illuminate a fairly small area. Stablights come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small pocket units that fit nicely in the hand to sturdy femur-sized metal rods that can double nicely as a truncheon. Stab-lights typically run off of cheap disposable power cells that feed a high-lumen gas bulb protected by a thin layer of transparent plastek or armaglass, and, depending on the shape and function, may include an adjustable focus function too.

A stab-light can throw a beam of bright whitish-yellow light up to 50 meters away. The light can be projected as a straight line or cone, though the total diameter of the illuminated area cannot exceed more than about five meters. A stab light's power cells last for 1d5+1 hours of continuous use before they run down and must be discarded - replacement power cells have a base price of 1 Throne and are Plentiful on most developed worlds.

#### Stummer

Stummers are almost standard kit for professional infiltrators and saboteurs, and are also well used by assassins, military snipers, and others who place a high value on stealth. Most would say that a stummer somehow absorbs noise made by its user, but the reality is somewhat more complex. The oblong object is about the size of a howler grenade and features about a dozen holes at regular intervals through which glimpses of thin fibre-like wires can be obtained. Once activated, a stummer issues a variable "anti-noise" that cancels out most sound-waves created by the wearer. Using a stummer to maximum effect requires some skill at moving in a certain way, but trained skulkers can become nearly inaudible while under one's effects. The basic technology behind a stummer is frequently used for acoustic isolation of heavy machinery, making obtaining spare parts for one relatively easy on developed worlds.

As long as it is worn in an exposed position, a stummer provides a +30 bonus to Silent Move Tests. A stummer can be switched on or off as a Half Action, and its power cell provides enough energy for up to 20 minutes of usage. The cell can be recharged in about an hour through most common Imperial power sources - alternatively, the user can swap out a spare power cell, which cells compatible witch takes a Full Action. Power cells compatible with a stummer have  a base price of 2 Thrones and are abundant on most developed worlds.

#### Survival Kit

Being marooned or lost in the wilderness, whether natural or man-made, can be a damning prospect for the unprepared. A survival kit is a compact and highly organized set of tools and provisions that, at least in theory, can be lifesaving for those stranded outside the reach of civilisation. The Haal-Lorden Cartel, based on the world of Cantus in the Markayn Marches, produces the "Throne Standard" of survival kits available in the Calixis Sector, and many patterns and makes used in military, civil, and Adepta situations are copies or close derivatives of the design. The Haal-Lorden survival kit includes a battery of equipment in a waterproof parcel that can be used as a flotation device in emergencies - the treated fabric's interior is lined with a reflective chem treatment for use as an improvised signalling device. The standard kit includes all of the following: two blade razors; a pocket igniter; a flexible wire saw; a dozen fishing hooks of various sizes; five weighted metallic lures; 25 meters of heavy-duty fishing line; a large meat-hook; 10 meters of metallic snare wire; a compact stab-light; a small booklet containing survival information and a single page guide for most worlds - the booklet has a pre-calibrated compass in the back with settings for several magnetically-anomalous planets; four stimm autojectors; six antibiotic tablets; 20 water purification capsules; a stypic pencil; two multipurpose flexi-bags; a 10 meter roll of adhesive tape; three meters of cord; a three meter roll of ceramite-weave reinforced tape; 12 meters of sewing thread; three sewing needles of various sizes; a sterile surgical needle; eight safety fasteners; a one meter-by-one meter square of metallic foil; a small pack of grease pencils; one narrow-quill with Water sure ink; six sheets of rolled paper; and two phosphor-red signal flares. How much of the kit will be useful in a given survival situation is questionable, but Haal-Lorden seems to have erred solidly on the side of over-preparation.

A character with a survival kit gains a +10 bonus to Survival Tests in most environments. If used creatively, the GM may determine that the equipment contained can grant bonuses to other skill Tests as well.
#### Synth-Skin

As the name suggests, this can contains an aerosol spray of binding enzymes and proteins mixed with powerful procoagulant agents and a topical pain/inflammation relief compound. Shaken and then sprayed onto an injury, synthskin leaves a thin foam that sticks to the victim's wound, causing rapid coagulation and promoting the regeneration of new skin. Timely application of synth-skin can be a savior to a victim at risk of death by exsanguination, and its very simple use - point the nozzle at the wound and depress - means that average citizens or soldiers can provide potentially lifesaving intervention when a trained medic or skilled medicae is not available. While not its primary purpose, synth-skin is also an effective field treatment for burn injuries and preventing secondary infection. Some wounds also tend to heal better when quickly treated with synth-skin, producing smaller and more orderly scars.

Using a can of synth-skin is a Full Action that automatically ends Blood Loss - no Tests are necessary. Synth-skin can be used as part of a Medicae Test to administer First Aid. If used on a character that has suffered Energy Damage resulting in burns, the medic gains a +5 bonus to his Test. One can of synth-skin is sufficient for five applications before it runs out.

#### Toxin Wand

Toxin wands - usually referred to as toxwands for short - are simple but particularly useful tools for determining what's ailing a victim. A tox-wand is something of a cheap medispex, using penetrating though benign ion radiation to identify common abnormalities in the victim's flesh and blood. Each is about the size of a large flow-pen - the likeness is reinforced by a protective cap over the fiber-like rad-scanners on the business end of the tool. Small lights on the shaft of the wand will blink in simple patterns as the wand scans a victim, and the device will emit a pattern of chirping noises when the problem has been identified. A user can attempt to memorize the patterns, or - more likely - attach the wand via cable to a data-slate and use the slate's screen for a visual description.

A character can use a toxin wand to identify the presence of poisons, venoms, and other virulence in the body. Using a toxin wand requires an Extended Action that takes three Rounds - at the end of the third Round, the character using the wand can make a Challenging (+0) Perception Test or a Routine (+20) Medicae Test with success indicating that the wand has identified the afflicting substance. Success with two or more degrees provides a thorough sampling that also indicates what antidotes or remedies exist, while failure by two or more degrees produces a totally incorrect diagnosis complete with a suggested antidote that will either be ineffectual, or possibly even make the ongoing condition worse!

#### Vox-caster

A vox-caster is an invaluable tool for long distance communication. Typically just called a vox, this device translates the user's voice into a burst of radiation that can be received across the air by other vox-casters. Compared to a vox-terminas (common equipment in many Imperial hive-cities) there is no need for voluminous cable conduits and mechanical switch-pits, leading to some - especially in military circles to refer to the boxes as a "wireless". Vox-casters are somewhat temperamental pieces of tech filled with vacuum tubes and cable-spooled amplificator cells - causing one to reach out and connect to the proper recipient is a complex affair requiring a precise understanding of the vox's gauges and meters. Soldiers tasked with carrying a vox-caster must be trained in its use, typically receiving a specialist pay increase, while vehicles equipped with one often have a crew member assigned to manipulate it. Portable vox-casters are often designed to be worn as a small backpack (this variety is typically encountered in military use), but less common varieties can be found built into a sturdy piece of luggage, the vox's operator unfolding the case to access the vox's controls and antenna.

Depending on environmental conditions, such as ambient weather and the presence of large structures, a portable vox-caster can be used to communicate with other vox-casters up to 3,000 kilometers away. Larger vox units, such as those found in Imperial Guard vehicles, may have a range two or three times higher. In all cases, using a vox-caster requires a successful Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test, with failure indicating the character only hears static. Establishing a connection to a given frequency takes one minute, though this time can be reduced by ten seconds for every degree of success on the operator's Tech-Use Test. Once the initial contact has been made, subsequent activations take a Full Action. 

#### Weapon Maintenance Kit

This is an essential kit for those who use guns and powered melee weapons and who can't have an ordained tech-priest tend to their weapons every night. Though it cannot fully replace the proper liturgical rituals and invocations, a weapon maintenance kit contains a variety of tools and items that will keep a weapon's machine spirit cooperative and eager between proper servicing. Common gear include lubricating oils and solvents, swabbing cloths, brushes and rod-handles, cleansing spray, and a silica towel to restore sheen and luster on external parts. Imperial Guard-issued kits will often include other components specific to the maintenance of lasguns or pistols, such as barrel honing plugs and mag-port cleaners, while private shooters will typically increase their kit with other bits of gear intended for the upkeep of their personal armaments. A new-looking kit, devoid of any specialized tools or chemicals, typically indicates a novice owner.
#### Writing Kit

When composing written material, Imperial citizens that are better-off can make use of devices like an auto-quill or may tap away at the rune-keys of a personal cogitator directly. Most, however, make use of simple but effective stationery to write personal communications or fill out affidavits and writs. Depending on the world and societal level, a writing kit will contain materials: sheets of animal vellum or pulp compressed paper; and writing utensils: real or artificial quills, flow-pens, or styli, all of which write in conjunction with a supply of ink. Manual calligraphy is often thought of as being the purview of the lower classes, where literacy itself is not always common. However, it is not unheard of for those with the means to leave writing to their staff or machines to still make use of such personal correspondence, with some going insofar as to suggest that direct composition is esoterically stimulating.

A writing kit is generally necessary to make Trade (Copyist or Scrimshawer) Tests.

### Primitive World Gear

The Imperium of Man has lifted countless billions from the depths of savagery into civilized society where all bathe in the reflected glory of the God-Emperor. For various circumstances, though, many worlds remain in lower states of development. Most are simply waiting for the proper elevation and growth of Administratum and other Adepta, bringing industry and social indoctrination with them, though a minority have been deliberately left as they are for a variety of moral, social, or economic reasons. Worlds of this type have much less evolved tech than other Imperial planets, but local gear and equipment can still be the margin between success and failure (perhaps life and death as well!) just as they are in the tallest of hive cities. Explorers and missionaries spending long periods of time on less-developed planets will often bring arsenals of tools and gear from proper Imperial stocks, but there are some who believe in truly absorbing the native existence and making do with only locally-available kit.

Note that the Availability of any gear whose name lists it as being found on certain worlds only applies on that same world - it may be  much rarer or totally nonexistent elsewhere.

#### Caltrops

Something of a primitive world's land mine, a caltrop is a length of twisted nail or spines ending in sharp tips. When thrown on the ground, a caltrop is designed to embed several of its sharp points into the soil, always leaving one pointing straight up. Caltrops are effective at disrupting the movement of enemy troops and beast-borne cavalry. Aside from the sharp point, particularly devious siege-planners have been known to coat large quantities of caltrops in venom or toxic spores to further magnify their effect as an area-denial weapon.

A single bag of caltrops has enough to cover a two-by-two meter area. A character with less than 3 Primitive APs or 1 non-Primitive AP on the Legs location must succeed on a Difficult (- 10) Agility Test to avoid injuring their feet. Failure reduces the character's movement speed by half until they receive medical attention for their injuries. Best Craftsmanship caltrops are coated with debilitating poison; if the character fails his Agility Test, he must also pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or take 1d10 points of Impact Damage (with no reduction for Armour or Toughness Bonus) just as if they'd been wounded by a weapon with the Toxic special quality.

#### Monrassan Capsican Trap

Monrass is divided by several empires locked in seemingly perpetual war, with each factions deploying huge armies of soldiers wearing brightly colored uniforms to more easily distinguish friend from foe in the brutal melees. The battle masters of Anevus, often finding themselves outnumbered on the field, devised a cunning way to "even the odds" in the form of the capsican trap. A mixture of sharp, barbed thorns, lantern oil, and spay-burner grubs (a native insect filled with pyretic acid) are mixed into thin clay pots that are buried ahead of a battle, leaving a few leaves and clippings on top to disguise the trap. When a victim steps on a trap, the pot collapses, spraying them with the spear-like thorns while the agitated grubs rupture and explode, inflicting painful acid burns that will likely ignite the sticky lamp oil for even more effect. Capsican traps are highly effective at disrupting huge masses of troops, and within a few years they were used by warlords across the entire world. Capsican traps have even migrated off Monrass in the hands of regiments raised for the Imperial Guard where they've proven effective in less primitive battlefields too. The breeding nests of spaygrubs, however, have proven a considerable source of annoyance for Munitorum quartermasters charged with oversight.

A character who steps on a capsican trap must succeed on a Difficult (-10) Agility Test to avoid crushing the pot. Failure indicates that the trap explodes, inflicting 1d10 points of Energy damage to the victim's legs. A second Challenging (+0) Agility Test determines whether the victim is set on fire as well.

#### Duskan Glo-slug

Among Dusk's many other carnivorous creatures are the fairly innocuous-looking glo-slugs. At first appearing to be little more than slimy brownish gastropods about five centimeters long, a glo-slug begins to extrude a bright phosphor glow when removed from its watery habitat. Although intended as a defense mechanism, native marsh-hunters have been known to gather up several glo-slugs and flick them into a jar, the amplifying light given off by a small pile of slugs providing considerable illumination. While perhaps not as bright as a traditional pitch-covered torch, a slug-lantern will "burn" longer and is safer to use, assuming you don't hold onto a glo-slug for too long while transferring it to the lamp.

When removed from water, a glo-slug emits light in a one meter radius. Gathering additional glo-slugs together increases this in a linear fashion with a theoretical maximum of 20 meters - glo-slugs tend to start cannibalizing one another in higher quantities, even if fresh meat is provided for them to feed on. Glo-slugs must be kept wet for at least half of each day, during which time they cease emitting light, though this can be broken up into continuous segments of any length. As long as the glo-slugs have adequate time in water and a supply of fresh meat to consume, two or more will produce enough eggs for newly-hatched slugs to replace natural losses due to age, disease, or being eaten by another glo-slug.

#### Kill Sticks

Even on worlds where metalworking has been fully developed a simple pointed stick can be a perfectly deadly weapon. Sharpened wooden sticks or stakes typically aren't used in open battles due to their difficulty in penetrating leather and metal armors, but they make very effective traps and obstacles where a falling victim's own mass makes the sticks significantly more lethal. Kill sticks are used to line small pits designed to trip and wound enemy soldiers crossing a field, but whole forests of them are sometimes used to deny an army the use of open terrain or to make scaling the slopes of a fortified position or castle more dangerous.

One bundle of kill sticks can be used to cover a one meter by one meter area. Characters stepping into an area covered with kill sticks must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Agility Test or else skewer themselves on the sticks, which deals 1d10+2 points of Rending Damage. If the kill sticks are hidden, such as in a camouflaged pit or trench, the Agility Test becomes Difficult (-10). 

#### Fervious Powder Bomb

Death cults that skulk through Fervious' shanties have developed these ingeniously simple devices to increase odds in their favor when facing more numerous opponents. Glass orbs about the size of a scrum-ball are packed full of a fine powdery pollen and are ignited with a simple fuse. When the lit fuse burns down the powder spontaneously ignites, rupturing its housing with great force and scattering the sticky pollen over a very wide area. The pollen is toxic to humans, but usually lacks the power to kill or inflict serious injury. Inflammation of the eyes, nose and throat, however, are much more likely, leading to confusion and disorganization among bands of men or a victim's bodyguards.

A Fervious powder bomb must be lit with a wick or lantern flame before it is throw (consider the bomb's Range to be 10 meters o three times the user's Strength Bonus, whichever is better). The powder bomb erupts in a 30 meter radius with the Smoke quality, and anyone caught within its effect who has not adequately protected their face must succeed on a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or gain a level of Fatigue. A character must Test Toughness each Round he is exposed to the powder, but can't gain more than one level of Fatigue from its effects. The cloud of pollen dissipates in 2d10+1 Rounds indoors or in calm conditions, while a stiff wind will blow it away in a single Round.

#### Skeleton Key

So named because the teeth of the key resemble a human rib cage, a skeleton key is designed to open many locks and are deliberately made at the same time as the locks are. Skeleton keys tend to be thought of as a noble's possession as they can grant access to an entire castle by themselves, and depending on the world and region, may be able to open the doors of inns, taverns, smithies, and other such doors in the local towns and hamlets as well.

#### Volonx Skem Net

Volonx's famed archers make use of these strange but highly effective bio-weapons to catch dangerous creatures or apprehend hated enemies. The net is formed in the main from a freshly harvested skem plant, whose hardy stalk can be used to contain the long tendril-like vines. The vines are wrapped up into a weave like pattern using strips of plant's stem that balloons open into a net of roughly six meter diameter. if attached to an arrow, the skem net fired a considerable distance before it opens to trap victim in its perilous embrace. The skem plant itself is highly toxic and "bleeds" a sticky sap when agitated - simple contact on skin can cause severe respiratory distress or or even death by anaphylaxis, making the prospect red a frightening one. However, the plant doesn't differentiate between a victim and its owner - archers who use skem nets must use heavy gloves to handle and bundle their nets, and careless or unlucky ones often fall victim to accidental exposure.

A skem net can be fired from most types of bows, though the bow gains the Inaccurate quality and its Range is reduced by half. A character hit by the arrow is treated as being affected by a weapon with the Snare quality, and unless they are wearing sturdy full body clothing, is also affected as if the net had the Toxic quality as well. A skem net dries out and dies 1d5 weeks after it is cut, losing its poisonous features, though it can still be used to snare and trap victims it is fired at.

#### Smoke Flare

A smoke flare is formed from a hollowed-out length of sturdy plant stalk packed to the brim with dyed cotton. When one end is ignited, a voluminous amount of thick, smelly smoke is created, which can be used for a variety of purposes. Feudal tacticians and battle-planners have come up with several clever ideas for such tools, such as signalling distant troops or allies through the used of colored dyes, as part of a trap to disorient enemy troops on the march, or - among those with uncanny foresight - to screen their own soldiers against the perils of massed enemy archer attacks. Of course, the only real limit to what can be achieved with a portable smoke-screen is the wielder's own ingenuity.

After being lit with a flame, a smoke flare begins creating a dense cloud that expands outward at a rate of 1d5+1 meters every Round up to a maximum of 40 meters. In calm conditions the smoke will expand evenly, but movement of the flare or the presence of a breeze will cause a more lopsided deployment. A smoke flare can burn for up to a minute, while the smoke it leaves behind will disperse after 1d10+5 minutes in the absence of a wind. A good breeze will blow the smoke away in 1d5 Rounds, and particularly strong winds can effectively neutralize the cloud from a still burning flare entirely.

#### Fedrid Spark Rocks

Many less-developed worlds make do adequately with flint or chemically-treated wicks to start fires, but Fedrid's natives have discovered an altogether more effective way to light their torches and lanterns. Spark rocks, uncannily enough, create sparks when two of the small white minerals are rubbed together, allowing a seasoned hunter or dour farmer alike to carry "ready-to-light" fire in his pocket. While light and easy to use, care must be taken to ensure that spark rocks don't come in contact with one another at any time when their holder _doesn't_ want to create a flame - more than a few inexperienced handlers have set their packs (or their pants) on fire by keeping their spark rocks in close contact. This highly useful utility has not gone unnoticed by Imperial explorers and missionaries - indeed, many common types of mass-produced igniters in the Calixis Sector use synthetic spark rocks to start their flames, and more costly models may actually use the real thing (though the effect is identical). Among the off-world game hunters that trek across Fedrid's jungles in search of dangerous beasts, it is something of a social faux pas to use anything but a pair of real spark rocks to start a flame.

#### Stink Bomb

 Assaulting a victim's olfactory senses is a common recourse for scummers and scoundrels on any number of worlds, but it is especially prevalent in primitive societies where effective protection from reeking smells is typically all but nonexistent. Mixing together a variety of unpleasant ingredients into a combustible or breakable housing creates a stink bomb, a weapon that can repel or nauseate groups of enemies without subjecting its holder to the same effects beforehand. Stink bombs used on the world of Munsk in the Josian Reach are a fine example of a well-engineered weapon: faeces from large carrion-worms are mixed with the virulent pollen of the aptly-named "dung-bloom" flower, with the foetid amalgamation balled up and then covered with a dried mud shell. The fragile shell shatters when thrown against a hard surface, releasing the fermented filth and filling the area with a horrendous stench. So vile is the odour that it can sap the reserve of even mighty warriors, leaving lesser men retching on the ground or even fainted from the reeking smell.

A stink bomb can be thrown up to 10 meters. Provided it lands on any kind of solid surface, the bomb ruptures and fills the air with an unbelievably foul smell. Anyone within 1d5+5 meters of the bomb's impact point must succeed on a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test every Round or gain a level of Fatigue from severe nausea - a character who can't get away from the miasma could pass out from the olfactory devastation alone. The stink persists for an hour outdoors and three times as long in an enclosed area. Characters who cannot smell, such as men who may be wearing filter plugs or victims of a sensory-depriving injury are entirely immune to a stink bomb's effects.

### Infantry Gear

It is said that all a Guardsman needs to win a battle is a guts and a lasgun, and while this may be true in spirit, it is a gross oversimplification of battlefield logistics, not to mention something of a slap in the face to the Imperial Guard's dutiful and stalwart quartermasters and logisters. Beyond a weapon and body armor, soldiers of various types, be they a Planetary Defense Force, a noble's house guards, naval armsmen, or one among billions in the Hammer of the Imperium itself, all tend to have a variety of kit at their disposal for the multitude of tasks and assignments they carry out.

Whether it is intended for the rigors of combat or the vapidity of garrison duty, infantry gear all tends to have some kind of militaristic any pieces are cataloged purpose, and m inventory of the Departmento Munitorum. Infantry gear is typically found in the employment of military situations and groups, but accounting for the massive production base of the Imperial war machine, along with the often overtly militarized and jingoistic aspects of society and culture, it is not surprising to find pieces of infantry gear in the hands of citizens, largely including those who aren't demobilised Guard veterans, too.

#### 9-70 Entrenchment Tool

This handy shovel - 9 centimeters wide and 70 centimeters long - is a part of the standard kit of many Guard regiments where, despite its name, the tool's primary purpose is found in the filling of sandbags. However, units that lack access to proper excavation tools and equipment will sometimes use their 9-70s to dig boltholes and trenches - this is generally discouraged as the tool isn't quite long enough to effectively shovel dirt, but only a few NCOs would prefer regulations over having good cover in a firefight. The 9-70's alloy blade and handle make it quite light yet also very sturdy - aside from moving soil, it can also be used as a nasty improvised weapon, and some regiments have taken a particular liking to eschewing bayonets and knives in favor of their trusty 9-70s when hand-to-hand combat is inevitable.

If the edges have been sharpened to a point - against Munitorum regulations but widely practiced anyway - a 9-70 Entrenchment Tool can be used as a melee weapon, dealing 1d10 points of Rending Damage with the Primitive and Unbalanced qualities.

#### Bedroll

Not everyone can look forward to sleeping on a cot or bed, especially in the field - in many cases, a soldier who desires something more comfortable than the dirt must bring it with him. Bedrolls are designed to be folded and rolled into a tight bundle that can sit atop or below a backpack, taking up a minimum of space and weight. Bedrolls tend to be generously cut so even the brawniest of Guardsmen can fully ensconce themselves in warm synth-fibre. Aside from sleeping, a bedroll can also be laid out to cushion a sniper's elbows and knees when lying prone, flung over the top of a bolthole to act as improvised camouflage from enemy flyers, and being flame-retardant - used to beat out small fires. Munitorum-issued bedrolls tend to be impregnated with poisons meant to kill small pests, though this effect wears off over time and may be entirely lost in second-hand examples.

#### Grooming Kit

Many military organisations maintain some form of grooming standards that everyone from front-line troops to supply officers and tacticians must adhere to. This is often due to local preference and a desire for a "professional" look, but in many cases serves a practical application as well, such as ensuring a close fit of a gas mask or helmet. A grooming kit will provide all the usual tools necessary for personal hygiene, such as shaving razors and soaps, dental brushes and pastes, counterseptic washes, and lotions or shampoos with antifungal or antiparasitic agents. Local and regimental variations abound, such as compact scissors for the tidy trimming of beards in groups where facial hair is common.

#### The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer

Equal parts field manual, prayer book, and identification, The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer is a small and sturdy publication printed in massive quantities for the Departmento Munitorum. When a Guardsman is first sworn to service he is issued a fresh copy of the primer and must keep it on his person at all times (failure to produce the issued Primer at the request of an officer is a disciplinary offence). The Primer contains several chapters on the regulations and policies of the Imperial Guard, an explanation of command structures (including a sizable portion dedicated to instilling fear and respect of the Commissariat), and a large segment regarding the maintenance and utility of various pieces of issued equipment. The second half of the book is filled with useful field information, such as basic pointers on survival and foraging, a treatise on different types of foul xenos that a Guardsman may have to fight, and a sizable portion of prayers, hymns, litanies and catechisms to reinforce the Guardsman's spirit and motivation. The rear cover contains biographical information about its owner - should the Guardsman be felled in combat, this page is torn out to verify its owner's death for regimental records and assist in informing next of kin (when feasible).

Each Guardsman's Primer is his main form of identification in formal circumstances, such as when receiving pay or post, going on leave, recording increases in rank, and travelling when away from his unit. These "civil" functions may seem superfluous to conscripts that may not survive their first battle of a brutal war, but the Primer's bureaucratic component is essential to salty veterans who spend years and decades in service to the Imperium. A conscript who survives his term surrenders the Primer when he is dismissed to indicate that his formal military service to the Emperor has concluded. When a volunteer is discharged, typically due to injury or age, they are entitled to keep their Primer as a memento of their sacrifices to the Imperium - it is also something of an open secret that flashing a worn Primer at a refectory is a good way to get free or cheap booze from a right-minded proprietor, and depending on the world and region, may have other "social" perks as well. 

#### Infantry Lamp/Tac-Light

This variation on standard stab-lights is more robustly constructed with an armaplas housing and double-thickness focusing lens. The shape of an infantry lamp allows it to be held in the hand or tucked into a uniform pocket, and a special slot down the side means it can be securely fastened to the melee attachment lug found on most patterns of lasgun. Guardsmen moving in darkness are well served by such a configuration, as it allows them to illuminate a target and then promptly mow it down. Of course, it also gives away the user's position quite clearly, and veteran troops will often prefer to make do with their own natural night-vision if at all possible for just this reason.

#### Melta Bomb

Few handheld demolition tools are as destructive as a melta bomb. These cylindrical devices are designed to be attached to a variety of solid and other wise impassable objects, such as bunkers, reinforced bulkheads, or the hulls of armored vehicles, and include large magnetic of adhesive bands down the length of the device for this purpose. Once attached the sapper activates a simple manual detonator and must them find cover immediately before the bomb detonates with incredible power, leaving the target very likely a smoldering just as if it been hit by a large melta weapon. Using a melta bomb requires very steady hand and measured response, especially of for soldiers attempting to knock out and active enemy vehicle. Fortunately, melta bombs can withstand a lot of abuse without spontaneous detonation, allowing the wielder to fully focus on the multi-ton death machine he must get within arm's each of.

A melta bomb is already fully set to explode once the integrated timer is activated - this requires no tests, although the character setting the bomb can still make a Demolition Test if he wishes to conceal the device or make it harder to disarm. Setting a melta bomb is a Full Action; device detonates in five Rounds which inflicts 6d10 Explosive Damage with a Penetration value of 12 to anything within a two meter blast and likely setting everything within the area on fire as well (if a character should manage to survive the explosion, somehow, he must also succeed on a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or be set alight too). Depending on the bomb's effects on its target, secondary explosions may have a significantly greater blast than the bomb itself.

#### Mess Kit

Soldiers in the field must sometimes carry a variety of basic necessities on their person. ill often have the benefit of a e be cooked it into a on the heat exchanges of an Encamped troops w properly staffed mess tent, but those in forward positions or involved in intense combat often have to make do with simpler means. A mess kit is a fully contained package that includes all the essentials for consumption of meals - this most commonly includes a combination spoon/fork, knife, mug, and a clam shell container that carries the kit and can also be unfolded to serve as a tray. The pieces are all made of sturdy and lightweight alloy that's been treated to resist corrosion. Giving their heavily processed and storable nature, Guardsmen who are subsisting off of combat rations usually don't need to make use of all of their kit, but it is especially useful when foraging has turned up edible food from the local environment. A hot meal can b prepared by putting the ingredients to in the container and then tossing campfire or leaving it idling tank for a while.

#### Sandbags

Sandbags are a cheap yet effective form of creating defensive fortifications in field situations. Fabric or synthetic sacks are filled with sand or dirt and then piled atop one another, often several bags thick, creating walls and revetments that are very effective at absorbing explosive blasts, shell or bomb fragments, and even las bolts. A sandbag can also be used as a makeshift pillow by stuffing it with clothing (or other sandbags), and are a handy way to blindfold enemy prisoners and captives too. Aside from the above uses, the act of filling sandbags is also a useful duty to keep idle soldiers busy, as boredom in the field combined with access to highly destructive weapons and vehicles has produced catastrophic effects in the past, especially when unit discipline is lacking.

#### Tac-Rig/Gear Harness

Soldiers typically have a large array of gear and equipment for various battle and garrison situations. Being prepared for every eventuality and having the right kit for the job can mean the difference between success and failure (and quite possibly life and death in parallel), but actually having ready access and availability of everything in a soldier's tool arsenal can be a conundrum in and of itself. Tactical rigs are a style of load-bearing gear that is designed to keep as many bits of kit within easy reach as possible. These exist in a broad array of patterns and styles, some of which are Munitorum-sanctioned and produced in vast quantities, while others are more regional and specialized in nature. Common formats typically employ a sturdy belt with removable framed suspenders festooned with gear-clips for attaching pouches, packs, rings, holsters, and other points where all matters of equipment can be stowed. When properly configured, a tac-rig can place almost all of a soldier's handheld kit at his disposal for ready use, though the rattling of grenades, clip pouches and knife sheathes bouncing against each other can be detrimental to stealth.

A character wearing a tac-rig or gear harness can stow up to 15kg worth of small items (typically no more than 1kg each) in the harness' various pockets and pouches - any items stored in this way never take more than one hand to ready. A tac-rig can also be configured for a fast draw by reducing friction on the stowed items and keeping them at the cusp ready to be grabbed. This grants the wearer the Quick Draw talent when Readying items stowed in his tac-rig. If the wearer already has the Quick Draw talent then he may Ready an item as part of a Reaction, such as grabbing a knife to Parry an incoming melee attack. This configuration imposes a -10 penalty on Silent Move Tests as the partly secured gear clatters noisily when the character is in motion.

#### Tent

Tents of various sizes are common items for any situation where one is exposed to harsh elements while encamped in the field. Compared to the sort of covers used by hunters and explorers, Munitorum-issued field tents are somewhat bulkier and heavier but are far more sturdy. Aside from keeping out precipitation or keeping in warmth from heater bricks, field tents are chemically treated to resist cracking and fraying due to acidic rainfall in polluted environments, and feature a double-sided construction with a reflective laminate interior. In scorching deserts or other arid environs the tent can be turned inside out, keeping the reflective surfaces facing towards merciless suns while keeping the shade below notably cooler. One tent has enough room to sleep two men and still have space for some gear and equipment. If assembled properly, several tents can be linked together to increase the available amount of sleeping space - two tents can sleep five, and three tents can sleep eight.   
 
#### Munitorum Tool Kit

This pressed alloy box contains a small arsenal of handheld tools meant for basic repair and maintenance work on many types of military hardware. Common equipment includes several types of pilers and tongs, wire snips, screw and bolt drivers, wrenches, insulated clamps, and a small hammer. Invariably included are one or more rolls of adhesive "mud tape" (so named because it sticks to everything and never comes off), which is considered by many soldiers to be a gift from the Mechanicus due to its ability to rejoin almost any mechanical component that has separated from its proper location.

A Munitorum tool kit provides a +5 bonus to Trade (Technomat) Tests made when repairing any sort of Munitorum-sanctioned gear and equipment, though it may be compatible with other devices as well depending on their provenance and the nature of construction.

## Specialty Equipment

Whether due to rarity, expense, or simply serving extremely esoteric purposes, some types of tools and gear simply aren't commonly used by most Imperial citizens. Acolytes of the by most Imperial citizens. Acolytes of the Imperial Inquisition, however, would do well to Imperial Inquisition, however, would do well to be aware of their existence in case some of these techno-obscurities or highly specialized bits of equipment come up during the course of an investigation. Some specialty equipment are truly spectacular works of Imperial tech and the arcane understandings of the mechanical, while others can simply be novelties and amusement for the wealthy and idle. Still more are simply unusual, ill-understood, or just limited in application or to certain segments of society. Specialty equipment's Availability assumes a general attempt to locate such gear within Imperial space. Specific tools and kit may be significantly more or less common on individual worlds depending on their type and utility.

#### Bomb Spray

Though of immediate utility to many covert agents and other clandestine types, this wondrous aerosol contained in humble metallic cans has a particularly small following due to the extreme danger inherent in its use. Bomb spray, as the name suggests, creates a chemically reactive layer onto any surface it is applied to. While inert as a gas, once it settles and dries the compound becomes incredibly unstable - any strong impact, such as a bullet strike or even a rock or brick being tossed at the coated surface causes the spray to violently detonate. Bomb spray was originally devised by a genius Magos Technicus from the lesser forge world of Perinetus as a means to easily facilitate demolition of archaic or ruined equipment or edifices. While very easy to use, bomb spray can't be easily controlled like proper demo charges or other forms of explosives - once applied, the "bomb" is set and can't be removed in any way. Moreover, poorly made or old cans can develop leaks, which slowly turn storage cases - or trouser pockets! - into bombs themselves with alarming efficiency. Because of this peril, bomb spray is rarely used for its original intended purpose, but the stuff is still manufactured for those intending more "destructive" effects, such as sabotage and laying stealthy traps.

Applying bomb spray is a Full Action that coats a roughly 50 centimeter square with a matte orange color. The bomb spray dries in three Rounds, after which any type of sharp impact causes it to explode. The detonation deals 1d5+3 points of Explosive Damage in a two meter blast. Additional applications of bomb spray increases the Damage by a further 1d5 and the Blast quality by 1. Attempting to apply a fourth dose of bomb spray causes the first layer to detonate, so it is not possible to use more than three applications. A single can has enough aerosol for five applications of bomb spray. Good Craftsmanship bomb spray produces the same effect but the spray is a neutral color that is far less obvious than the demolitions orange.

#### Cogitator

Wondrous devices composed of fine circuitry, gas tubes, and coil sleeves, cogitators are highly sophisticated machines that sift, analyse, and parse through data that is input by the user. Cogitators can't "think" on their own - such abominable intelligence has been banned since the Great Crusade by decree of the Emperor Himself, and for good reason - but they come remarkably close through the use of meme-routines and vast macro-coding that are linked in strings by the user and then run in sequence. Getting a cogitator to do anything but hum peacefully and use power requires that the user be well familiarised with the necessary input codes and algorithms, but once armed and set a cogitator can perform all the heavy lifting on its own. Depending on their construction and size, a cogitator may be capable of performing all sorts of tasks beyond simple calculation and collation of data, such as splicing and editing pict or vid-feeds, operating logis-controlled machinery, and so forth. There are some who believe that a cogitator's true capabilities can only be employed by a suitably ordained techpriest who can bypass the simple input controls and interface with the cogitator's complex and multi-faceted machine spirit directly.

A character must have the Tech Use skill to activate or use a cogitator. Some routines can be performed without a Test as the character's innate knowledge of codes and sequences is sufficient, though more complex or logarithmic tasks may require one or more Tests of varying difficulties. All cogitators provide a bonus to Literacy, Logic, and Common or Scholastic Lore Tests; the bonus' value depends type of cogitator. Depending on its construction or the abilities of the user it may be able to offer a bonus to other Skill Tests as well, such as Inquiry or Evaluate.
##### Cogitator, Emplaced

An emplaced cogitator as about as close to "standard" as these devices go, and are typically about the size of a large dresser or small closet. These machines contain a large assortment of circuit plates as well as mechanical relays and require a steady power supply to function. Most have a sizeable panel festooned with ports, plugs, and sockets, including a revolving mechanism which can completely swallow data-slates to process and transfer information contained on the portable devices. The cogitator will typically be contained in a sturdy alloy cabinet studded with small gauges and meters along with one or more pictscreens that display "live" data being processed by the machine. Examples that are employed directly by the Adeptus Mechanicus will invariably employ a fine wooden cabinet with brass reinforcement instead, keeping with the Martian priesthood's affectation towards ensconcing their tech-marvels in elegant organic housings. Most cogitators include a hard-wired rune board and numeric keypad for quick of data and textual meme-routi often paired with a smooth orb in a socket that is rotated with the fingers to move through visual data and text-logs. Finally, most emplaced cogitators will also include an auto-quill or heat writer (or both) to output their findings onto a physical medium for review or archiving.

An emplaced cogitator grants a +20 bonus to all Literacy, Logic, and Common or Scholastic Lore Tests made while using it. If a connection to a public info-net is available and wired in, it also grants a +20 bonus to Inquiry Tests, though it does not shorten the duration of the Test and some "footwork" will still be required to follow up on leads.

##### Cogitator, Personal

Though they lack some of the more advanced sub-sets and routines, a personal cogitator has one vast advantage over its larger brethren: the device is only about the size of a small piece of luggage which clam shells open to provide access to the cogitator's screen and rune pad. A personal cogitator is powered by a replaceable power cell with an identical footprint to a lasgun charge pack and can be used for about six hours before it must be recharged. Through the use of adapters and cables a personal cogitator can be connected to data-slates and some other forms of equipment to read or transfer information off of them, but it is generally much less capable at interfacing with advanced techno-devices than the heavier emplaced systems. Further, the lack of heavy memory coils, which would make the device considerably more bulky, means it has no capability to store data when the power is switched off. Most owners tend to keep a separate data-slate handy for just such a use.

A personal cogitator functions just like an emplaced unit but it offers no bonus on Scholastic Lore Tests. Additionally, it can't be connected to a data-loom, memrance enhancer, or matriculation engine. Spare power cells for a personal cogitator have a base cost of 10 Thrones and are Common, but it can also run off of standard lasgun charge packs as well.

##### Data-Loom

This mechanical device is made up largely of heavy-duty switchers and relays that interface with double-coiled memory banks – essentially, the device excises the main calculation functions of a cogitator without the circuitry and macro-coding that make up much of a cogitator's systems. With that space freed up, a data-loom is able to house a highly sophisticated geometric display screen that can represent information as visual constructs, making sifting through it much more intuitive to laymen outside the Adeptus Mechanicus. A data-loom can be used by itself to parse recorded material and compare variances in both picts and textual medium, and includes several input ports and slots to read from provided data-slates as well as magnetic reels and liquid storage cylinders. However, for those with the power connections and room to spare, a data-loom can be wired into an emplaced cogitator, lending its considerable logis-systems to the cogitator's own to more quickly process and codify all matters of recorded material.

If used individually, a data-loom provides a +10 bonus to Logic Tests when processing information from data-slates or written material. A data-loom can be wired to an emplaced cogitator to create a powerful analysis engine, adding its bonus to Logic Tests to the cogitator's own for a total of +30. Furthermore, the amount of time necessary to complete an Investigative Benchmark (see Using Investigation Skills on page 186 of _Dark Heresy_) is reduced by half in most situations.
##### Matriculation Engine

Something of the opposite of an auto-quill, a matriculation engine takes materials written on paper, vellum, or parchment and converts them into memory data that can be viewed on data-slates or cogitator screens. Records and forms inscribed on fragile and flammable sheets can thereby be preserved on more storable media, and there are countless adepts throughout many Imperial institutions whose sole task is to operate these devices so as to better protect important written works and archives from destruction by fire and vermin. Of course, such records are ill-suited for official usage, and indeed many documents are specified as a matter of formality to be rendered on rolls or sheets, leading to the rather comedic affair of data-archived files being reproduced via autoquill back into a more "officious" format. 

As long as the character has the Tech Use skill a matriculation engine grants a +30 bonus to Trade (Copyist) Tests made to transcribe written materials onto data-slates and similar devices.
##### Memrance Enhancer

This simple-looking edifice, resembling an alloy shoe box with a few data-cables peeking out from one end, is in reality little more than a highly compressed stack of triple-thickness memory coils capable of storing a very large amount of data. Memrance enhancers can be used to improve a cogitator's meme-routines and calculance power by providing far more information for it to process and consider when performing analysis. Care must be taken when using memrance enhancers as their machine spirits tend to be inscrutably confrontational with those of the cogitators they must be connected to. If the proper rites are not observed, especially with regards to the order in which the devices are connected and disconnected, the memrance enhancer can burn itself out, and quite possibly take the cogitator with it!

A memrance enhancer increases an emplaced cogitator's bonus to Logic and Literacy Tests by +5. Best Craftsmanship versions do the same, but also contain much more detailed data on subjects that many Imperial authorities – the Inquisition included – would rather citizens not have access to. This allows the attached cogitator to grant its bonus on Forbidden Lore Tests. Note that possession of such devices ranges from mere illegality to an outright moral threat depending on who's asked.
#### Demo Charge

A demolition charge – demo charge for short – is a simple but effective device meant to bring down unnecessary structures and clear rubble or debris out of the way of work being performed. The shape and composition of a demo charge varies widely, but in general it will be formed of a large quantity of cheap, low-grade explosives packed into a satchel or canister and fitted with a suitable triggering device. The charges are bulky and heavy for the amount of destructive power they bring, but are quite reliable at what they do. Demo charges are nominally civil devices, but they are often used in military situations for sabotage and creating defensive works. In theory, a demo charge can be used in combat, but this is a remarkably perilous endeavor. Imperial Guardsmen tasked with carrying a demo charge for breaching field obstacles are almost invariably volunteers and receive double pay along with better rations as an incentive for their incredibly dangerous payloads. 

A demo charge is inert until it has been primed and armed with a detonator - see Demolition on page 101 of _Dark Heresy_ for more information on setting an explosive. A demo charge inflicts 3d10 points of Explosive Damage in a five meter blast - linking multiple demo charges together increases the Damage by 2 points and the blast by one meter for every additional charge. Attempting to combine five or more demo charges together increases the Difficulty of the Demolition Test by one step for each additional charge beyond the fourth. A Demolition Test can be made while the charge is being placed or in advance, leaving the charge armed and ready to explode as soon as the setter activates the detonator. However, carrying an armed demo charge is incredibly dangerous: if the character carrying the charge takes more than 5 points of Explosive Damage or 1 point of Energy Damage the charge immediately goes off. The character carrying the charge cannot attempt an Agility Test to avoid the blast.

##### Hollow Charge

More advanced than its simple "satchel" brethren, a hollow or tube charge is effectively an oversized and simple krak warhead that focuses its blast over a very narrow area. Hollow charges are almost invariably used to breach obstacles or for point-blank destruction of armoured targets and tend to have magnetic or adhesive surfaces on the "business" end of the charge to make sure it faces the correct direction. Because of their highly focused explosion, hollow charges are much safer to work with, and can be used for a variety of precision applications in both military and civil roles.

A hollow charge must be directly affixed to its target while being set, and unlike standard demo charges, cannot be linked together to form a single larger explosive effect. Setting a hollow charge takes roughly 50% longer than a standard demo charge - in normal circumstances, this makes the Demolition Test an Extended Action, and the charge can't be armed until it is attached to its target. A hollow charge inflicts 3d10 points of Explosive Damage with a Penetration value of 6 to whatever it is attached to. Anything (or anyone!) within a 2 meter radius of the charge suffers half the charge's Damage due to secondary spalling and concussive effects (change the Damage type to Rending and reduce the Penetration value to 0). Once attached, a hollow charge can be physically separated from its target with a Difficult (-10) Strength Test. Unlike standard demo charges, a hollow charge is not at risk for a premature detonation unless the character setting it critically fails his Demolition Test.

#### Det-Tape

A seemingly harmless putty-like substance, det-tape is actually a highly explosive compound that is triggered when any kind of current is run through it. Det-tape is stable and easily shaped to fit on a variety of objects and areas, making it a very versatile explosive, but the low size and mass of the stuff tends to result in relatively small blasts. Det-tape is commonly used to set off larger charges simultaneously, but can also be employed to precisely sever large pipes and conduits. It is not typically considered a proper explosive on its own, but the Adeptus Arbites have become particular enthusiasts for using it as a convenient and effective way to breach solid doors - the tape is simply pressed around the perimeter of the door with the resultant blast sending it cleanly out of the frame.

Det-tape must be carefully planted and affixed to ensure it remains in contact with the target - Demolition Tests to "arm" it take roughly twice as long as normal. Once planted, det-tape inflicts 2d5 points of Explosive Damage with a Penetration of 1 to anything it is in direct contact with. Det-tape is very stable and flexible, and will not explode even if set on fire, but just a single point of Damage from any source that also has the Shocking quality will immediately cause it to detonate, and areas with high static buildups may cause a spontaneous reaction as well.

#### Dagnostor/Medispex

A diagnostor - also known as a medicae auspex, or medispex in shorthand - is something of a highly advanced tox-wand, though such a comparison belittles the diagnostor's very sophisticated faculties. A diagnostor broadly resembles a pistol-type weapon, but its muzzle only houses several types of multi-spectrum analyzers and sniffers that use a combination of harmless ion radiation, sono-imaging, and precision chem-detectors to identify and diagnose a bewildering array of pathogens, poisons, and bio-hazards that a victim may be suffering from. The results are presented on a small screen integrated on the back of the device's housing, along with any suggested remedies that may be available. Diagnostors are armed with the breadth of ailments and afflictions known to Imperial medicae scholars it has been said that anyone who manages to turn up an "unknown" result on a medispex will likely have the privilege of naming the condition they've just discovered, though this will likely be of little comfort to the victim.

A diagnostor can be used to identify almost any condition or malady a victim may be suffering from. Using a diagnostor is a Full Action, after which the user must make an Easy (+30) Medicae Test - any success identifies what's causing the victim's infirmity as well as what countermeasures can be taken (a grim conclusion of "Prayer" is provided if there is no known cure or remedy). If the user fails the Test the diagnostor is unable to identify exactly what is causing the victim's condition, though it still provides suggestions to treat the ongoing symptoms if not the cause itself. 
#### Disguise Kit

Altering one's appearance is one of the easiest and most straightforward means of subterfuge available as humans and even many xenos identify looks quite a bit more readily than any other physical quality. Disguise kits contain a variety of tools and aids meant to allow a character to artfully change his visage and perhaps other features as well. The name is something of a misnomer, however, as no manufactorums or commercia houses simply produce these items as prepared kits - most are hand-assembled by professional infiltrators where they take bits and pieces from a broad range of sources and combine them together into a single arsenal of deception. The level of thoroughness, utility, and versatility of a given kit can be represented using the same scale as Item Craftsmanship.

A disguise kit can generally be used up to 1d5+10 times. If a character succeeds on a Disguise Test by two or more degrees he uses only half as many supplies and materials as usual, in which case a single disguise kit could be potentially used as many as thirty times.

**Poor:** Typically little more than repurposed cosmetics and balms, simply altering one's complexion and covering distinguishing marks (or adding new ones) can throw off cursory inspection. Further, cheap disguise kits appear to be perfectly innocuous items of hygiene and beauty, meaning a search of one's possessions typically won't raise suspicion.

Disguise kits of this type grant a +5 bonus to Disguise Tests based on appearance.

**Common:** These kits are much better assembled and arranged - aside from powders, dyes and balms, they also frequently contain false features such as color-changing contact lenses, very convincing wigs and other facial hair substitutes, clip-on piercings, and even flesh putty that can be used to make the face and neck seem thicker, rounder, or more defined than it truly is. Transparent inserts are also provided that can be placed in the mouth to make the lower jaw sit at a different angle or projection, ensuring that even a profile view will look thoroughly different.

Disguise kits of this type grant a +20 bonus to Disguise Tests based on appearance.

**Good:** High-quality disguise aids start crossing a line into medicae and chem-oriented solutions, which are often more durable and stable than simple surface treatments, though they require a correspondingly higher level of skill to pull off adequately. The fact that they don't "wash off" as easily can be something of a detriment too with thoroughly disguised users being stuck as their impersonation until the heavier substances wear off. Drugs and serum injections can drastically change the user's skin and hair pigmentation while electro-pricking can create or hide scars, change the density and consistency of hair, and alter other distinguishing features that are, for all intents and purposes, quite real, though the user's original flesh will re-assert itself after a week or so unless repeat applications are performed. 

Disguise kits of this type grant a +30 bonus to Disguise Tests based on appearance, but only if the character using the kit also possesses the Medicae skill.

**Best:** These kits are broadly similar to lesser styles in use, but contain even more advanced tools and substances to completely bury the user's original appearance, including a somewhat "watered-down" version of the infamous drug polymorphine. Giving enough time and talent, an infiltrator can disguise their form to resemble almost any other human, including changing gender quite convincingly, and some are even able to create an appearance more suggesting of a humanoid xenos-creature, though the kit's limits can't make up for those with substantially different biology (radically altered posture and large variances in physical dimension, for example). Those making use of these powerful and frankly dangerous tools have, on occasion, been known to become so thoroughly committed to their disguise that they begin to suffer from personality disorders, literally believing that they _are_ their disguise.

Top level disguise kits grant a +30 bonus to Disguise Tests, and also allow a disguised character to speak in a radically different fashion - the character is treated as if they had the Mimic talent, though the difficulty of Opposed Scrutiny Tests to detect thesubterfuge is decreased by one step. If the user already has the Mimic talent then the difficulty of any Opposed Scrutiny Tests increases by one step instead. Depending on circumstances, a thoroughly disguised character may be able to fool gene-locks and other devices meant to measure biometric data. 

Such deep cover runs the risk of profoundly affecting the user's psyche - if he succeeds on a Disguise Test made to drastically alter his appearance by three or more degrees he must also pass a Difficult (-10) Willpower Test or gain a minor obsession disorder (see Disorders on page 235 of _Dark Heresy_) to continue disguising himself as such in the future. Success by more than five degrees on the Disguise Test inflicts a severe disorder to do the same instead.

#### Drusine Incense

This superior incense was promulgated by then-General Drusus in the period before he assumed command of the Angevin Crusade, and with his elevation to sainthood the recipe was swiftly sanctified and disseminated throughout the Sector. The incense is a mixture of myrrh, camphor, verdigris, and crushed blossoms of the Iocanthine rose, the latter adding a reddish speckling to the otherwise green-brown consistency. Aside from a pleasing if astringent aroma, the incense is said to have a protective and purifying effect on those who inhale its vapors. The incense is used in High Masses and other ceremonies of import across the Sector, with the finest blends being prepared within the vaults of the fantastic Cathedral of Illumination in Hive Tarsus itself. However, there are some among the Holy Ordos who believe, with some factual base, that the incense's ability to ward off evil is more than just inspirational thinking.
 
Drusine incense can be burned in any suitable receptacle, such as ornate censers for conducting mass or self-heated thuribles that can be worn on the belt. Any character who can strongly smell the burning incense - typically those within a radius of 10 meters in a large censer or three meters in a thurible - are immune to the effects of the Daemonic Presence special rule. This only works on characters with less than 10 Corruption Points, however, as no saint would abide those with tainted souls. A single packet of incense burns for 1d10+20 minutes.

#### Vessel Emergency Kit

Almost invariably packaged in bright orange reflective parcels, a vessel emergency kit is commonly found aboard void faring ships, but are also often stocked in flyers and trans-atmospheric craft, and one is just about always packed into a savior pod. An emergency kit will typically include the following tools and gear: a glow stick that provides steady illumination for 1d5 hours; a universal power cell that can be used to give a rudimentary charge to many devices, such as vox-casters or lamp packs, and can also provide enough energy for a laspistol to fire 10 shots; a compact ration pack and water bottle sufficient to keep a man alive for a day; an emergency vox programmed with a void ship's normal comm channels as well as a faculty to broadcast the standard Imperial Prayer for Aid on emergency frequencies; a mask with an attached air bottle that can provide 30 minutes of breathable air, useful in situations with smoke or toxic contaminants; a pack of five anti-radiation tablets, which can be a real lifesaver for those who've been exposed to a plasma reactor meltdown or solar flare; and a tube of hull sealant gel that can affect quick repairs to small breaches in a fuselage or deck-plating.

#### Emergency Hab


An emergency hab, typically referred to as an "e-hab" in conversation, is actually little more than a sealed plastek package containing what initially appears to be a tightly folded bundle of fabric with a number of thin alloy rods that can be screwed together in various shapes and patterns. Instructions printed in Low Gothic on the inside reveal the emergency hab's marvelous functions: the fabric reacts sharply when exposed to water, stiffening into a totally firm sheeting fully capable of holding its shape and then some in less than a minute. The hab is designed to be set up by stretching it over a framework of the provided poles and then doused from the outside, after which it permanently forms a rigid tent that can keep out rain, snow, and wind as well as provide shade in sun-baked climes. Stranded flyer crews and long-range exploration teams with access to an emergency hab can make a much better shelter while awaiting rescue, though it can be used just as easily for non-emergency situations as well, such as a hunters' camp or archaeological expedition. An emergency hab is superior to conventional tents in almost every way with the notable exception that it cannot be broken down again - once deployed, an emergency hab holds its shape forever, and many are simply abandoned where they lie once their occupants no longer have use of them.

An emergency hab can be stretched to form a variety of shapes and provides enough space for three people to shelter within. An emergency hab that can shelter six people, typically referred to as a "duplex e-hab", costs an extra 100 Thrones and weighs 3 kg more.

#### Excruciator

Sometimes called a "porta-rack" in jocular parlance, an excruciator is a compact device about the size of two data-slates stacked atop one another that can simulate extreme pain and suffering on a victim. The device itself, typically jet black in construction, is actually a heavily modified medispex with its machine spirits repurposed to inflicting, rather than mollifying, painful sensations. The only actual torture devices are a mane of hair-like wires that are taped or stuck into the victim's skin which stimulate nerves into agonizing feelings whose exact intensity, duration, and "flavor" can be controlled by the excruciator's operator. While a wonderful and terrible tool in the hands of a seasoned explicator, an excruciator is laughably useless to those who don't already have a good grasp of the art of interrogation, and indeed is more likely to put a victim to sleep than to get them to divulge confidential information if used by a novice or inexperienced operator. While many believe that excruciators are typically the purview of the Imperial Inquisition, many enforcer cadres and even well-connected recidivist groups make use of them too - all the tortures once can possibly devise in a compact package that does no physical harm to the victim is an appealing prospect to just about anyone who specializes in such efforts.

An excruciator grants the user a +30 bonus to Interrogation Tests when used on a restrained and helpless victim, and the victim suffers a further -10 penalty to Deceive Tests made to try and throw off their interrogator. Furthermore, an excruciator can't inflict Damage on a victim even with a badly botched Test, though the victim still gains the usual bonus to resist further questioning. Reckless or extended use of an excruciator can be dangerous, however: if a victim gains more levels of Fatigue than his Toughness Bonus due to repeated interrogations he must pass an Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test or expire due to a sudden infarction. An excruciator takes about an hour to set up due to its finicky machine spirits requiring lengthy rites and burning of incense before they will cooperate with the user. An excruciator's operator must have both the Medicae and Tech Use skills to make use of the sinister device.

#### Forgery Kit 

A forgery kit is designed for one thing only: creating or modifying documents with false information or credentials. Typically thought of as being the purview of scummers and recidivists taking advantage of the Imperium's heavily bureaucratic nature, a forgery kit can be just as readily used by the forces of justice and retribution to sidestep normal formalities and observances as well as to infiltrate highly developed organisations and cults. Depending on a forgery kit's level of sophistication and versatility, it may be used on existing writs and certifications on paper all the way up to purpose made data-slates and cognomen, though some especially sophisticated forms of security may well be immutable by even the best forger. Forgery is very often a capital offence on many worlds, especially those with a strong Administratum presence, and as a result skilled forgers are usually few and far between: the less talented of their ilk frequently winding up as scribe-servitors once their crimes are exposed.

Forgery kits grant a bonus to Forgery Tests made by the user which varies depending on how advanced the kit is. More versatile and elaborate kits can be categorized using the same scale as Item Craftsmanship.


**Common:** Replacement sheets of paper or parchment and specially reactive inks can be used to create copies of written material with as much accuracy as the forger can muster. Wax seals and stamps can also be replicated with the use of a configurable stamper or signet, though specialty waxes might need to be obtained separately. In general, any written material that does not incorporate especially complex anti-forgery features can be forged with with kit.

Common Craftsmanship forgery kits provide a +10 bonus to Forgery Tests when working with paper, scrolls, and parchment documents. The user must have the Trade (Copyist) Skill to benefit from the kit's bonus.

**Good:** This adds a specially derived codifier kit to the usual arsenal which can sniff through documents and records for concealed or hidden authenticators and anti-forgery features, though defeating them may be another matter entirely. The codifier can be attached to an auto-quill to replicate papers and forms with complex headings and margin frames, and a special chemical wipe can simulate the weight or texture of special types of paper. In the hands of a skilled forger, this kit leaves few types of documents that can't be bastardised.

Good Craftsmanship forgery kits provide a +20 bonus to Forgery Tests when working with paper, scrolls, and parchment documents. The codifier can also identify hidden anti-forgery devices in the material to be forged - the user must succeed on an Opposed Scrutiny Test against the original writer's Security or Trade (Copyist) Test made to apply the measures. The user must have the Trade (Copyist) and Tech Use Skills to use all of the equipment. The codifier and extra chem-sets add an additional 3kg to the weight of the total set.

**Best:** Aside from written records, this forgery kit can also falsify materials that are kept in data format on data-slates or cogitators whose memory can be modified after-the-fact. Many types of cognomen can be forged or modified too, which can open quite a few doors both literally and metaphorically. An intrusion-slate filled with eager lines of macro-code can be connected to other data-slates and cogitator systems which can readily delete or substitute data that is already contained, though it lacks the power to perform any meaningful damage to the operating routines of the equipment itself. Because of the threat posed by this type of forgery equipment it is not uncommon for especially valuable or important information to be stored on data-slates that can only be written to once, which is effectively foolproof right up until the forger physically replaces the slate's innards with some of his own devising.

Best Craftsmanship forgery kits provide the same bonuses as the Good Craftsmanship versions but can also be used on records that are contained on most types of data-slates and cogitator banks. Cognomen that use any kind of circuitry or memory coils can also be forged. The intrusion-slate and attachments increase the weight of the set by a further 2kg.

#### Gene-Printer

A gene-printer is a fairly sophisticated apparatus that uses a small battery of logis stacks combined with sensitive sniffer-fibers that can closely compare samples of gene-spoor (hair follicles, skin, bodily fluids, and so forth) to determine if they are from the same source. The Adeptus Arbites and their skilled verispex adepts make heavy use of these devices to secure evidence of guilt from the persecuted - criminals and recidivists have decried the reliability of such arcane methods, though the Lord Marshal Goreman has insistently defended their accuracy and even-handedness. Aside from the black armored Arbitrators, well-funded enforcer cadres, such as Scintilla's Magistratum, also equip themselves with these tools of justice. A gene-printer is fully self-contained, requiring no external connections to process its information, and is compact enough to be stuffed into a backpack and carried in the field, which allows for quick analysis and conviction of the guilty without the need to return to an enforcer house or precinct-fort.

Using a gene-printer requires a successful Ordinary (+20) Tech-Use Test. Two samples of gene-spoor are placed in individual trays and taken into the gene-printer where it performs its analysis and conclusions - the process takes about 1d5 minutes. Any success confirms what relationship, if any, the gene-spoor samples have to one another, while failure indicates an inconclusive result. Failure by three or more degrees does the same but also ruins both samples as the gene-printer's machine spirit becomes irate. While effective for most cases, providing samples of exceptionally strange genespoor, such as heavily mutated creatures or xenos beings, can have unpredictable effects.

#### Glidewing

This techno-marvel enables a limited form of flight for its wearer with large avian-like wings that create a striking image. A wound-be flyer dons the glidewing's harness which is worn like a large backpack - projections slightly shorter than the wearer's legs are used to steer and maintain stability while the thin metallic plates that scissor outward like wings provide aerodynamic lift. The glidewing works off of a combination of air currents and passive suspensor fields - it does not have an engine or propulsion source in the traditional sense, which helps keep weight and complexity low. Glidewings are often a plaything of nobles who hike up mountains or tall towers and then fling themselves off to leisurely survey the lands below as a sort of escapism from the confines of gravity, soaring through the air on glossy silver wings, but limited numbers have turned up in the hands of military users where they are employed like a long-range grav-chute, deploying commando teams far behind enemy lines in daring night-time raids. The fact that a glidewing is nearly silent in flight makes it ideal for this purpose, and matte black versions carrying strike teams can insert quietly to destroy important communications and logistic sites, assassinate enemy leaders, and sabotage weapons and equipment.

Using a glidewing requires the Pilot (Glidewing) or Pilot (Personal) skill. A glidewing grants the user the Flyer (12) Trait, but is incapable of gaining altitude without the use of thermal updrafts and cannot hover in any meaningful way. If launched from a platform that is at least 15 meters off the ground a glidewing can remain flying until its wearer/pilot tires from using his body to control the lifter's turning and altitude adjustments - use the rules for Forced Marching (page 213 of _Dark Heresy_), reducing the time margins by half to accommodate for the greater effort required to control the glidewing. Flying a glidewing requires the use of both hands. "Donning" a glidewing's harness and pack elements takes one minute, and the apparatus can be removed as a Full Action. While in its folded position a character can move and act freely on foot, but the bulk of the glidewing itself imposes a -10 penalty to Agility-based Tests. Because the alloy body of the glidewing is fairly fragile most who would attempt to use one in a combat situation quickly remove the harness once on the ground and collect it again at the cessation of battle. 

#### Grav-Chute

Grav-chutes are the preferred means for flyer crews to bail out of a crippled vehicle in flight, but are also often used by the Imperial Guard to rapidly deploy strike teams from aerial transports and gunships. A grav-chute works off of the same principles as a much larger and more powerful jump pack, but is merely designed to slow the wearer's fall to a survivable speed – handy after jettisoning one's self from a high altitude transport. A grav-chute's backpack frame mounts a pair of stabilized counter-grav generators that rapidly decelerate a falling wearer – assuming the device functions correctly, the character will return to the soil with relative safety, though it is to his detriment if he can't find somewhere safe to land. Grav-chutes are designed with simplicity and ease of production in mind, which allows them to be manufactured in large quantities, but this does tend to result in more than a few having defective power cells or generators. Most patterns of grav-chutes include a dedicated reserve drogue just in case the counter-grav generators prove less than successful.

Grav-chutes can be configured to deploy automatically at a predefined altitude (anywhere above 500 meters), including the moment the wearer leaves his flyer, or can be left to a manual activation at the wearer's discretion (requiring a successful Routine (+20) Agility Test). A grav-chute has a 10% chance of failing to activate – if the grav-chute fails, the character can attempt to activate the reserve drogue with an Ordinary (+10) Agility Test, during which time he falls another 100 meters. If the Test fails, the wearer can attempt to activate it again until it opens or he hits the ground (inevitably with fatal results). Grav-chutes are somewhat noisy and the generators create prominent blue jets when the device is in operation – this can make a grav-chute's wearer vulnerable to enemy attacks, leading some to risk a manual activation at very low altitude. A grav-chute needs an absolute minimum of 50 meters to slow the wearer to a safe landing – activating the grav-chute below this altitude means the wearer takes Damage when they hit the ground as if they'd fallen from a height equal to every meter past the 50 meter minimum. A character with the Pilot (Personal) skill can attempt to steer a grav-chute as it descends, though only if the counter-grav generators are functioning.

#### Grey Device
  
Few know about the origins of these mysterious brushed-metal boxes, and those that do are perfectly tight-lipped about it. A grey device is a machine of unknown provenance – when connected to a power source, it chirps and whirrs at odd intervals, but seems to have no other function. A few Magi of the Mechanicus have speculated that the grey devices are fragments of archaeotech, machines meant as part of some broader system or network, but the bulk believe that the grey devices hold some kind of secrets or lost information and are simply waiting for the right kind of stimulus to reveal their contents. An alarming number of grey devices seem to keep turning up in the hands of hivers and forge labor helots, however, many of which have developed a gambling game based off of the grey box's actions and responses to various occurrences around it. More rarely, commoners have used grey devices as unusual means of prognostication, as the boxes tend to produce very recognizable noises and patterns to verbally stated or written questions made in their presence. Whether this is actually a property of the enigmatic devices or just unusual coincidences is unknown, but an alarming number of men condemned for heresy seem to have first strayed from the path of the righteous after an encounter with a grey device.

#### "Heretic's Wake" Deck

As the name may suggest, this debased deck of tarot cards is used in an extremely illegal card game that has spread throughout the Calixis Sector over the last century. The designs on the cards themselves, twisted parodies and satires of those on a proper Ministorum-sanctioned deck, are rumoured to be the machinations of the infamous heretical illuminator Cassilda. While the Inquisition has so far refrained from declaring the cards to be a moral threat this has not stopped the Sector Synod from doing everything in its power to stamp out the game those found in possession of a deck are subject to grievous punishment, and enforcers of the Ecclesiastical laws catching the players of a game in progress will typically put the entire table (along with any spectators) to the torch. Paradoxically, the crackdown has only made the game more popular, and hands being played with an open chair for the curious can be found in dark corners in almost any city on every world in the Sector. It is said that drawing a certain combination of cards will grant the player visions and instructions toward a far greater and more dangerous game - or possibly just make them go mad.

#### Hololith/Holo-Projector

A far more advanced device than simple image projectors, a hololith can display all matters of visual material as a shimmering monochrome cone in the air. Anything from text to picts and charts can be displayed as such, and those with sufficient connections can even illuminate live feeds over vox and pict-casters. The hololith console itself is bulky and seems heavier than it should, typically encased in a strong alloy or wooden case with polished brass or copper fixtures and bristling with cables and wires for connection to external cogitators or voxterminas jacks. Because of its ungainly construction hololiths are typically used in stationary environments, such as the briefing rooms of many Adepta compounds and military headquarters where their illuminations can be viewed in darkened chambers filled with incense and vapors that enhances the clarity of the images. Aside from creating a stunning look, typically with vibrant blues or oranges, a hololith also has the advantage of central display - an audience can sit in a circular configuration, keeping the attendants in close contact with one another as compared to stretched oblong seating for typical projectors.

Good Craftsmanship hololiths can display their images with multiple colors at once to create a sharper and more defined visual, but otherwise function the same.

#### Holo Wafer

Holo wafers are small disposable devices about the width of a coin and no larger than a man's palm. Each contains a tiny power cell that provides enough power to project a small hololithic image when a button is depressed. Holo wafers are largely novelty items that are sometimes used as bargaining chips, badge or crest displayers, and signal markers - anything that a common card or small sign could be used for, but with a pleasing projected appearance that floats a few centimeters in the air. In the underworld of Hive Sibellus holo wafers tend to have a far more sinister application as the "marques" of professional assassins and hitmen, sending the immediate signal to common hivers and enforcer heavies alike that a death was no mere murder. The symbology can vary widely, but those who are well connected in the criminal underworld - and all too often, the halls of the elite in the spires - will typically use a winking skull or a crying mother to show that powerful forces have ordered the killing. Holo wafers that turn up next to a corpse on distant worlds are especially profound, showing that the long and vindictive arms of intrigue from the Sector's capital know no distance or time.

#### Intrusion Spirit

This simple, almost featureless-looking dataslate has a single port that is covered by a removable insulated cap. Securely locked within is a particularly feisty and rebellious machine spirit eager to escape its prison and wreak havoc on greater machines and systems. Intrusion spirits are the ultimate multikey for logis-controlled locks and security devices - once unleashed into the system, the intrusion spirit goes wild and partakes in a wanton orgy of consumption, devouring and obfuscating everything it can before burning itself out, leaving the lock open and totally unable to be secured again. Obtaining a securely packed intrusion spirit can be a costly endeavor, but the ease at which they can brutally force open advanced security devices makes them worth every Throne to the infiltrator who can take no chances. Once the intrusion spirit has run its course, the plain data-slate becomes little more than a paperweight. The Adeptus Mechanicus is sharply divided on the use of intrusion spirits some believe in their great utility as well as the esoteric interest in the destructive and almost emotional manner they carry when deployed, while others view it as being an abuse of Mars' sacred craft that skirts the fringes of tech-heresy.

An intrusion spirit grants a +30 bonus to Security or Tech-Use Tests made against any locks or security devices that have any kind of data-port that the intrusion spirit can access, and the Test takes only a Full Action to execute. Any locks or security devices opened by an intrusion spirit remain open until they have received repairs by a suitably ordained member of the Mechanicus. The intrusion spirit can only be used once, even if the Test is a failure. Note that a failed Test will almost always activate any sort of tampering fail-safe or alarm that may be installed on the security device - use of an intrusion spirit is very decidedly an all-or-nothing approach.

#### Line Ascender

A line ascender is a fairly simple powered device that is intended to be attached to lengths of rope or cable and quickly move the operator up or down the line. The tripartite machine is composed of individual wheels or fine-toothed gears each possessing its own motor installed in a flexible hinged bracket. The bracket is opened or closed like a bolt cropper, causing all three moving parts to clamp down on the line and grip it firmly. Two handholds are provided onto which the user grips and then allows the device to pull him along in the desired direction. The ascender can be sent along the line without anyone holding onto it by engaging a separate auto-mode switch, in which case it zips along until it reaches the end of the line and stops there. Line ascenders are typically used by manufactorum crews and mine-rig operators as an easy way to cross open areas or reach vertical areas quickly and with minimal effort - these areas frequently have cables and lines in abundance, whether for use in stabilizing a structure, providing an insulative ground link, or even purpose-built transit cables for the ascenders themselves. Unlike grapnels, they are not typically used in military applications as the sound of the three rollers meshing together around the line produces a distinctive whining noise that can carry noticeably far.

A line ascender can be attached to any reasonably smooth rope, cable, wire, or line that is free of obstructions and knots. Once attached, the user can grip the line ascender (using both hands) and ride it safely at a speed of up to their Agility Bonus in meters every round regardless of whether the ascender is moving up or down, horizontally or vertically. The ascender itself can move much faster, but the strong vibration and risk of getting caught up in the cable or mechanism can lead to disastrous accidents. A character can move up to twice his Agility Bonus by succeeding on an Ordinary (+10) Acrobatics Test or Challenging (+0) Agility Test, with failure indicating that he loses his grip on the ascender. As a safety feature, a line ascender will stop if it meets any kind of obstruction on the line that might inadvertently disengage the wheels. Attaching a line ascender is a Full Action and removing it is a Half Action.

#### Melta Gel

A blanket term for highly compressed reactive pastes meant to fuse and cut metallic objects, melta gel is so named on account of the intensity of its white-hot reactions are akin to the results of a melta gun's discharge. Melta gel is most often used by the crews of voidships to perform spot repairs of hull plating or to cut entrances through bulkheads or jammed doors. Aside from the requisite intensity to burn through superdense naval alloys, it also possesses the highly desirable quality of functioning in the absence of oxygen - very useful in situations where a partial or total loss of atmosphere can be encountered. It is less commonly used in planetary environs, though it does have certain special applications, such as quickly cutting up gargantuan sections of conduit and fusing gas extraction rig-heads before pumping has begun. In theory, it could be used as a substance for military demolitions, but the fairly slow burning would make its utility questionable in combat and the very bright light it emits would do the same for covert action.
  
A single tube of melta gel can create a thin line up to five meters long at a rate of up to 10 centimeters per Round. Melta gel's sticky consistency can adhere to many surfaces allowing the user to "draw" a line as he desires, even on vertical planes. Melta gel is ignited when a current runs through it (a small "pocket sparker" is provided with the tube), inflicting 1d10 points of Energy Damage with a Penetration value of 10 every Round for a full minute, but it can only react with metallic substances - if ignited on organic or mineral matter, such as rocks, flakboard, or a Grox, it simply burns and fizzles away with little more than a few puffs of smoke to show for it. 
Melta gel can remain on whatever it's been stuck to almost indefinitely, but the application of an alcohol-based solution causes it to crumble away into a harmless sludge.

#### Penthrift Dreadfuls

These cheaply-printed pamphlets and periodicals are a rather base form of entertainment for hivers, hauler crews, and other "lowest common denominators" of Imperial society, though adepts and the well-to-do have been known to indulge in their lurid pages from time to time. Penthrift dreadfuls typically contain all matters of sordid literature - murders of passion, ganger killing sprees, intrigue in the hive spires, and terrible xeno seductresses - all of which tend to be couched in morality tales or hasty warnings so as to evade the censor's hand. Firebrand Ministorum preachers often target these "dirty maps to heresy" for showy and theatrical conflagrations, but most powers-that-be allow the publishers to carry on their torrid serials either as a source of tax revenue or because the stories within their pages keep the readers properly incensed against threats to society. The dreadfuls with a wider circulation tend to receive a cursory glance from the Inquisition from time to time, however, should any dangerous information manage to work its way into the scripts and illustrations.

#### Pict-Fly

Equal parts techno-wonder and elite espionage device, pict-flies are wonderfully useful instruments for the conniving and underhanded. The tiny brain and nervous system of a flying insect is housed within a compact multi-legged construct that can crawl around on its needlelike appendages or fly on minute gossamer wings - only close inspection or an auspex scan would reveal the mechanical nature of the device. A pict-fly has a limited logis stack that can receive and carry out basic instructions, such as "follow the man in the red boots" or "hover above the terminal for an hour", which it will carry out to the best of its ability. A battery of micro-sized pict-stealers and vox pickups can record and transmit the visual and audio cues from the immediate vicinity via a tightly compacted antenna coil in the pict-fly's abdomen - the device has no room for any kind of data-storage, so any signals sent to an inattentive viewer are lost. A pict-fly can transmit its findings over a long distance, but the broad frequency can be easily jammed by background interference, operating machinery, or large metallic objects, and most clandestine types who would use a pict-fly prefer to let their costly tool get no more than a few hundred meters away.

A pict-fly can transmit what it sees and hears to most common pict-casters with the aid of a special receiver module that can also be used to recharge a pict-fly's unique power cell (the module weighs 2kg). The visual and audio returned tends to be of a fairly low quality - Perception-based Tests to observe the going-ons take a -10 or -20 penalty for sight- and sound based occurrences, respectively. A pict-fly's insectoid wings create a low buzzing noise in flight - those nearby can attempt a Hard (-20) Awareness Test to locate the pict-fly while it is flying. The pict-fly has the Flyer (5) Trait and can make Concealment Tests with an Agility of 50 if it needs to hide. Because of its diminutive size and fragile construction, any kind of attack including an errant stripling swatting it out of the air with a stick - ruins the arcane device. The pict-fly's power cell can operate for up to three hours, after which it finds the nearest flat surface and shuts down.

#### Pinner

A pinner is a decidedly criminal item that many suspect is produced using illicit funds from the recidivist Kasballica syndicate. The tool resembles a hand-held dumbbell used for strength training and practicing bell-ringing motions, with the large cylindrical pods on each end of a sturdy handle about 20 centimeters across. When an activation stud is pressed, the pinner begins emitting a powerful field fluctuation. This has no apparent effect on its own, but existing magnetic fields become far stronger - especially those that run off of electromagnetic reactions, such as dipole maglocks and mag-harnesses. Kasballica agents, along with the scummers and recidivists whom they sell to, have been known to thoroughly humiliate entire Arbitrator kill-teams by activating a pinner and then fleeing into the shadows while the troopers struggle to free their weapons from overcharged mag-harnesses. These affronts, combined with the complete and total havoc a pinner can wreak if activated in an area of heavy machinery, has made mere possession of one an offence punishable by summary execution, typically with a very public shotgun blast to the back of the head.

Activating a pinner is a Half Action that only requires a free hand to hold the device. Any active magnetic devices within a 30 meter radius exponentially increase in power, which can cause all sorts of unpleasant effects. A character wearing a mag-harness or using a dipole maglock must succeed on a Hellish (-60) Strength Test to pry his weapons or gear free of the supercharged magnets. In the case of the magharness, the character may find themselves physically stuck to a nearby wall or floor if the surfaces are ferrous in nature.

#### Poi-Savant

Some food, whether naturally-occurring or deliberately tainted, can be just as deadly as a hot bolt slamming into your center of mass. Travelers on distant and unknown worlds, brave or foolhardy traders making contact with untrustworthy xeno counterparts, or hive nobles in societies known for backstabbing can all find death in consumption of food and drink - fleshy plants that resemble something from one's home world could be virulently toxic, and the piping hot brew offered by a friendly server might be laced with a deadly poison. A handy poi-savant can provide a quick warning as to whether or not a foodstuff is safe to consume, making it an essential tool for those who are often around potentially perilous consumables. Poi-savants come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with costlier variants being smaller and more discreet to use, but all work on a basically the same principle: the cogitation stack contained within performs a fast analysis on a sample of the food to be consumed, either through sticking a small probe into the substance, or if the food is hot, ingesting the vapors it gives off. The sample is referenced against various bio-chemicals known to be toxic, either by themselves or when mixed together, which generally provides a very accurate and no-nonsense prediction of the safety of the sampled food. The poi-savant is no gourmet, of course - a confirmation that food is edible doesn't mean its flavor is at all desirable.

A poi-savant can be used as a Full Action by making an Easy (+30) Tech-Use Test or as a Half Action by making an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test - the latter can also be concealed from suspicious or easily-offended eyes with a Sleight of Hand Test. Any success indicates whether the food is safe to consume, while a failure returns inconclusive results. Failure by two or more degrees, however, causes the poisavant to misread the sample, possibly reporting safe food as toxic and poisonous food as safe (GM's discretion). Other functions depend on the poi-savant's level of Item Craftsmanship.

**Poor:** The cheaply-made cogitation coils and relays in this savant require a larger housing and analyse information more slowly, but its ability to detect poisons is just as good as the better made versions. They are often used as a cost effective way for explorers to forage on alien worlds and are also used as part of agri-processing to randomly check food stuffs for contamination or unacceptable levels of toxins. 
The device must be pressed against the food to be sampled so the simple reader-cell can take in the suspect food's essences.

Poor Craftsmanship poi-savants are about the size of a small pistol, complete with a grip to hold it, weighing twice as much and taking a full minute to analyse whether or not a food item is safe (the user can't take a penalty to their Tech-Use Test to reduce this time).

**Common:** About the size of a data-slate and including a small screen to report findings, this type of poi-savant is the most typical variety used by those with a concern for their food's purity. The savant makes use of a needle-like wire lead to sample solid or liquid foods - a hot item that is giving off vapors, such as a freshly cooked Grox flank, can simply be passed over to provide enough of a whiff for the savant's use.


**Good:** Expensive poi-savants are built with miniaturized circuitry and samplers, often no larger than a small pencil or flow-pen which can be easily hidden up the sleeve of a generously cut garment - perfect for discreetly checking the amasec at a soiree. The entire savant is used to test food's safety, typically by inserting the tip a millimeter or two into the item, though simply holding the instrument near hot food will be sufficient thanks to rising thermals carrying traces of virulent substances that may be within. A tiny light on the opposite end of the savant indicates the food's safety - a solid glow for edible, blinking for toxic, and a single blink for inconclusive results.

Good Craftsmanship poi-savants weigh only one-quarter as much as Common Craftsmanship versions and grant a +10 bonus to the user's Sleight of Hand Tests if he's trying to be discreet in using it.

**Best:** The finest of hair-thin coils and rare metal-clad inputs allow the poi-savant to be shrunk to an utterly minuscule size. These savants are almost invariably crafted to commission by spire nobles, Rogue Traders, and other men of worth who can't afford the social faux pas of acting with impropriety when eating with their peers (no matter how prudent it would be). Common shapes and forms are rings, bangles, and small piercings, all of which could idly brush up against food with a gentle movement of the arm. Some go to particular extremes and actually implant the device into a finger or palm, allowing any food handled directly to be sampled.

Depending on the style and situation, a Best Craftsmanship poi-savant grants a +15 or +20 bonus to Sleight of Hand Tests made to discreetly use the device - its weight is negligible. An implanted version costs an extra 700 Thrones and is all but imperceptible to anything but the most discerning or suspicious eye.

#### Privacy Field Generator


There are times where a man simply does not want his affairs to be known to unwanted parties - shadow operators and their handlers, delicate commerce negotiators, and Inquisitorial cell briefings can all benefit highly from having absolute confidence that the immediate surroundings are devoid of prying eyes or ears and their mechanical counterparts. A privacy field generator does exactly what its name suggests - projects an area of both visual, aural, and wireless interference that blocks visual observation as well as sound waves and acts as a narrow-spectrum jammer for vox-bugs and other such listening devices. The exact method of operation of these clandestine devices is hard to pin down. It is believed that they are based around a core similar to a highly over sized stummer linked to a number of microphones integrated into the device's housing that cancels out noise within the field, but with the aid of a "null cone" at the very center that still allows the occupants of the field to hear one another. Visual dampening is done by manipulating and bending light in the area around the device, a technology that some believe may be less than human in origin - if the Adeptus Mechanicus has taken umbrage to such speculation it has not stopped their members from using privacy fields when discussing matters of high importance. Some establishments that cater to an especially elite clientele will integrate a privacy field generator into tables or fixtures in the ceiling, but most of these rare and infinitely useful devices are designed to be carried around like a piece of luggage so they can be set up at liberty opening the case reveals the device's controls. For all its power, a privacy field generator is no more difficult to employ than a common vox caster, though attempting to disassemble one almost always results in the device failing to activate again when put back together.

A privacy field generator can be activated or deactivated as a Full Action with an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test. While active, the generator projects a field in a five meter radius that distorts vision and completely absorbs sounds on both sides of the field along with completely preventing any kind of wireless communication, such as through a micro-bead, between the inside and outside areas of the field. The field itself glows warmly, creating the illusion that the characters and objects within it are beyond a gently sifting pane of frosted glass this obscures all detail, but does absolutely nothing to hide the existence of the group itself. The generator must be nominally stationary while the field is in operation: it could be used on a void ship sailing through the immaterium, but accidentally knocking it off the table results in the field disappearing as the generator shuts off to protect itself from damage. The generator's internal power cell has enough energy for about an hour of usage, but most users keep it connected to an available conduit to make assurances that the field doesn't fizzle out at an inopportune moment.

#### Psy-Focus

A psy-focus is something of a "charm for psykers", though aside from whatever mystical powers the charm may possess it is also a decidedly psychoactive item. Whether or not this is an innate property of the item itself or actually a manifestation of the psyker's will through a properly attuned trinket is anyone's guess - the less one ponders the nuances of the warp the better. Any Emperor-fearing sanctionite will inevitably have a psy-focus of some kind - more common examples include sacred relics such as small bones or vials of blood, holy icons and badges, crystals and jewelry, and other blessed mementos typically bearing at least a small number of Ecclesiastical symbols. Of course, more obscure or esoteric psy-foci can be found silver-finished pistols, mercy blades, belt buckles, walking staves and so forth. In theory, just about any smallish item that can be held in the hand could serve as a psy-focus. These trinkets are never encountered for sale as such psykers just seem to know where to find them and are typically tight-lipped about it.

When grasped in the hand, a psy-focus grants a +10 bonus to a psyker's Invocation Tests. A psy-focus can be immediately identified by a psyker with an Easy (+30) Psyniscience Test, but to most other characters it simply appears to be a charm or some other common item.

#### Psycrystal

These strange quartz-like minerals began to appear in the Calixis Sector after the Koronus Expanse was opened. Initially considered to be little more than attractive conversation pieces, demand picked up considerably after it was found that the normally smoky grey crystals began to glow with a deep purple aura when in the presence of warp energies. These can be used for a variety of purposes - one whimsical touch is on the famous liner _Andrea Graza_ where the crystals are integrated into the halls of the passenger decks to indicate to the embarked when the vessel is in the warp - but by far the most sought-after application is in the detection of psykers themselves. Those who seek out and acquire these unusual and provocative items tend to have a deep-seated fear or concern that those with extraordinary powers may be spying on their activities, or worse, lurking around corners with nefarious intentions in mind. The fact that psycrystals tend to be found on barren, dead worlds that once hosted verdant life before some sort of cataclysmic event obliterated the biosphere (a worryingly common occurrence in the Koronus Expanse) has given them a slightly disquieting reputation in spite of their obvious utility, with some suggesting that the crystals themselves are cursed.


A psycrystal requires no activation or input from its wielder whatsoever - simply having it where it can be seen is sufficient. The crystal gives off a rich purple hue about as bright as a candle when any of the following exists or occurs within a five meter radius: a creature or character with a Psy Rating or under the effects of Spook; an object or item recently held by a psyker or which has a strong psychic attunement; or a psychic power or effect is used on anyone or anything. Much more powerful psychic effects, such as a void ship entering the warp or the summoning of a greater daemon may cause a psycrystal to flare up even if it is occurring significantly further away. Psykers seem to have an innate dislike of psycrystals, finding them to be uncomfortably hot to the touch and generally off-putting in an indescribable way. Sustained contact with one for more than a few moments will begin to cause burns that will increase in severity until the psyker begins taking actual Energy Damage.

A character carrying a psycrystal may find himself suffering from calamitous situations more often than usual - treat this as something of the inverse of a charm.

#### Sky Eye

A sky eye is a fantastic piece of techno-arcanum about the size of a scrumball that can scan and survey large amounts of territory from the air with almost as much ease as a much larger recon-drone sometimes employed by artillery regiments of the Imperial Guard. The sky eye takes the form of an a almost featureless metallic sphere dotted with dozens of tiny ports for micro-scanners and an inbuilt suspensor array - there is no apparent means to access the sky eye's no-doubt wondrously sophisticated innards. A sky eye is paired with a similarly elegant docking station that provides the device with power and is used to input commands. The sky eye can be programmed to fly out to a given area and perform surveillance quietly from the air - it moves at a modest speed but with impeccable grace and can cover a substantial area before returning to its docking station to recharge and display its findings. In the Calixis Sector only the highly advanced and sprawling forges of the Lathes can produce these exquisite machines, where they are viewed as being works of micro-tech art just as much as useful tools of exploration and reconnaissance.

Sky eyes can be loaded with a set of instructions to cover and scan a given area up to 15 kilometers away - the device takes to the air and finds its way to the target, using its micro-scanners to create a three-dimensional map of the area. The process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on the size of the target, distances involved, and "traffic" that the sky eye must avoid to get there. Its task complete, the sky eye will unerringly return to the location it was launched from (this requires the docking station to be at the same general spot as it was when the sky eye left), landing flawlessly to begin recharging and providing the information it has gathered. The docking station is equipped with a small hololith to display the maps on-location, and includes standard data ports so the information can be sent to data slates for later review on larger systems. Simple instructions, such as taking a peek at the roof of a nearby building, require no Tests on the part of the user. More complex plans or programs, especially those directed at areas that can't be observed from the launch location, will typically require an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test, and may be considerably harder if the sky eye must navigate in a very specific way, travel near the edge of its operational radius, or fly through small passages or openings. On a failure, the sky eye simply refuses to launch, though failure by two or more degrees angers its machine spirit and causes it to become inert for 1d10 hours. The sky eye is durable enough to survive bumping into objects or minor impacts in the course of flight, but its body is easily destroyed by weapons fire - if it takes even a single point of Damage, the sky eye self-destructs in a brilliant cascade of white sparks to preserve the enigmatic construction from hereteks and others who could prosper with its secrets. The sky eye moves with the Flyer (8) Trait and its active stealth procedures require a Very Hard (-30) Awareness Test to notice its presence by sight or sound, though an auspex scan will detect it normally. The sky eye and its docking station are uniquely paired, so if one is destroyed the other is effectively reduced to a mantel display or conversation piece.

#### Strait-Cape

When manacles just aren't good enough, dedicated man-catchers resort to the strait-cape. This restraint device consists of a heavy duty synth-fabric bag reinforced with memory wire and festooned with other features meant for very reliable confinement of the prisoner, though most enforcers don't employ all of them at once except against especially dangerous captives. With a strait-cape thrown over their torso, the prisoner's arms are completely restrained in immobile sleeves that allow no use of the hands and extra straps can further secure the prisoner's legs in a foetal or hogtied posture. The straight cape further includes a hood that can completely blind, silence, and deafen the prisoner with heavy padded straps, keeping them isolated and unable to utter foul heresies (or nasty epithets) to their captors. While not the intended purpose, some chasteners of the Arbites believe that fully confining a prisoner helps reinforce a sense of vulnerability, which makes them more pliant in the ensuing interrogations. Giving the qualities of memory wire, a strait-cape can also be used as a much more improvised restraint device where the cape is literally tossed at the target, grappling them in its embrace until more purposeful binding can be affected.

A strait-cape can be primed and flung at a target where it will wrap them up - treat this as a ranged attack with a Range equal to twice the attacker's Strength Bonus as well as the Inaccurate and Snare qualities. If properly secured using all of the strait-cape's finer features, a process that takes about a minute for a trained enforcer, a character is completely Helpless, Blinded, Deafened, and cannot speak, preventing the use of any Talents or Skills that rely on sight, sound, and the use of the voice or limbs. When properly bound and tied, a strait cape imposes a -50 penalty to Contortionist and Security Tests made to escape, and each Test takes five times as long as usual. It is impossible to break out of a strait-cape using pure Strength alone - the captive is simply unable to gain any purchase to put their muscle power to good use.

#### Tracking Device

This very simple homer is designed to be covertly planted within a target's effects and then to follow the unsuspecting victim or his targeted item. This sort of tracking effort is typically deployed as part of a larger strategy to use a compromised target to reveal the physical location of the ultimate quarry. Because this sort of endeavor usually indicates a high degree of sophistication, finding a tracking device in your luggage is sometimes enough of a fear-inducing discovery to shake those with a weaker will. The tracking device itself is only about the size of a single Throne Gelt, using adhesive or magnetic pads to attach itself to just about anything. The device gives off a low power vox signal on unused frequencies that can be interpreted by a special handheld locator about the size of an auspex. The locator indicates the rough direction and distance on a small pict-screen, leaving the operator to deal with structures and obstacles that might be in the way. The locator can pick up the tracking device's bearing from many kilometers away, but interference from built-up areas such as hive spires or giant manufactoria yards can drastically shorten the range to as little as a few hundred meters - this often necessitates fairly close pursuit.

A tracking device can be planted covertly using Concealment or Sleight of Hand Tests as necessary. Once paired to a locator, the tracking device reports its direction and distance relative to the locator as best it can - the rest is up to the locator's operator. The device can be recovered and re-used simply by peeling it off from whatever it was attached to. Should the device or locator be lost, the tracking device itself has a base price of 50 Thrones while the locator's makes up the rest for the purposes of obtaining replacements. A locator can only track a single device at once.

#### Venom Ring

Typically thought of as a decidedly Malfian fashion accessory, venom rings are pieces of fine jewelry that contain a small reservoir capable of holding poison or toxins within. The ring itself hasn't got any delivery methods, such as concealed injectors or darts - it "merely" makes the task of carrying the poison and preparing it for use much simpler. Normally, a poison carried in a venom ring is meant to be applied to food or drink, the accessory being casually triggered when a hand passes over a plate or serving tray to release its contents at a discreet moment. Venom rings are the most common forms of this nefarious item, though other types of jewelry can also be made to suit the user's tastes. The only real limit is adequate space for the reservoir and a convenient location on the body for deploying the poison.

A venom ring imposes a -20 penalty to any Tests made to observe that the wearer is dispensing a poison or other substance into food or drink.

#### Vox Bug

This self-propelled listening device is essentially a miniaturized micro-bead's aural pickup and transmitter that has been fit into a mechanical body vaguely resembling a tiny beetle. The cortical material from ubiquitous hive-roaches makes up its basic intelligence functions - the vox bug can be told simple instructions, such as "climb into that woman's handbag" or "hide in the left corner of the next room", which it will carry out as best as its faculties permit. The bug can also be switched into an inert mode and then simply stuck under a shelf, behind a conduit box, or any other concealed location, in which case its tiny pincers latch on to an applicable perch and it remains in place. In all cases, the vox bug faithfully reproduces all noises that occur nearby, transmitting them to any micro-beads or vox casters that are listening in on the correct frequency. The tiny transmitter can't apply encrypt-ciphers to its signal, so it is not unheard of for paranoid individuals to cycle through frequencies on a vox-caster when entering a room they suspect may be bugged. If a noisy feedback loop appears on a given channel, the concerned party will know his privacy has been compromised in the nearby area.

A vox bug can move along the ground or any contiguous surface at a rate of 1 meter per Round. If it needs to hide, the vox bug can make Concealment Tests with an Agility of 60. The vox bug can transmit everything it hears just like a micro-bead, including the range limitations and the ability to trunk through a vox-caster. Because of its tiny size and mass, any kind of attack - especially being stepped on - ruins the A vox bug can transmit for up tech-artifice entirely. m to a week before its power cell expires and must be recharged. Agents who need to have uninterrupted eavesdropping will often, circumstances permitting, wire the vox bug into an available power box or conduit to keep its cell fully charged, in which case it can theoretically operate forever.

#### Vox-Thief

A vox is typically a secure way to communicate with peers, contacts and allies, but a where there's a will - and the right artifices of the Machine God - there's a way. A vox-thief is uniquely purposed device that is designed to clandestinely interject itself into existing lines of over-the-air comms, such as what is employed by most vox-casters and micro-beads. The devices are notoriously finicky to work with as their machine spirit must willfully interfere with the operations of others, but an agent who can make the machine work for his purposes can quickly become a very unwelcome yet totally unknown party to a formerly secure channel. The effort required to employ a vox-thief is heavily dependent on the amount of "traffic" the user must sift through to find what he's looking for. Open areas where cultists meet in secret is a fairly mundane task, while trying to jack in to a coven in a heavily populated habstack could be a very challenging endeavour. A voxthief's range is directly proportional to the unit's size - most are about the size of a large data-slate and are capable of scanning into the nearby airwaves. Larger models that resemble vox-casters in weight and dimensions can reach out and spy on unknowing subjects much further away, while certain forge worlds are rumored to have gargantuan vox-thieves the size of a heavy battle tank installed as orbital A vox is typically a secure way to communicate with peers, contacts and allies, but a where there's a will - and the right artifices of the Machine God - there's a way. A vox-thief is a uniquely purposed device that is designed to clandestinely interject itself into existing lines of over-the-air comms, such as what is employed by most vox-casters and micro-beads. The devices are notoriously finicky to work with as their machine spirit must willfully interfere with the operations of others, but an agent who can make the machine work for his purposes can quickly become a very platforms that can theoretically listen in on any vox-casters on the entire planet.

Activating a vox-thief requires a successful Difficult (-10) Tech-Use Test to coax its machine spirit into action. Once activated, the user can begin to listen in on active vox traffic in the area. Isolating a specific conversation or pattern out from an area that already has heavy communications, such as a hive spire or forge, may require additional Logic, Scrutiny, or Tech-Use Tests as deemed by the GM, though a properly configured emplaced cogitator can be immensely useful in pairing off the background chatter. Encrypted communications require an additional Security or Tech-Use Test to reveal what's actually being said - the difficulty is directly proportional to the strength of the encryption and cipher. A compact vox-thief about the size of a data-slate (weight 1kg) can pick up signals within a range of about two or three kilometers, while a heavy-duty vox-thief that is designed to be carried around like a backpack (weight 20kg) can reach out to a distance of around 50 kilometers. Local interference can dramatically shorten the radius of either device, of course. Both versions are equipped with data-ports to log their findings onto data-slates or another available storage format for later analysis.

#### Vox-Tracker

This heavily modified vox-caster can't actually be used for any kind of communications at all, but its machine spirits have been repurposed into a much more creative and clandestine role: instead of bridging an aural link to another voxcaster, a vox-tracker locates others and reports their general direction and distance to its operator. This is especially useful for locating a target that has hidden himself in remote environments but is still keeping in touch with his contacts by a vox. A vox-tracker must be set up in a particular fashion with the use of a detached interceptor array, making it something of a cumbersome device to use in time-sensitive situations. Likewise, the device is essentially useless in areas with heavy vox traffic - after trying to isolate more than a few sources of vox transmissions the device will overload, possibly blowing a few tubes before shutting down and refusing to function again until its machine spirit has been suitably placated.

The vox-tracker itself weighs 6kg - the remaining 5kg is the interceptor array, which must be set up in a vantage point that has relatively clear line of sight. The array includes a 50 meter spool of cable to allow the vox-tracker to be set up in a more convenient location than the outside of a foundry roof or ledge of a tall habstack. A vox-tracker takes a minimum of one minute to set up, possibly taking longer if the environment is tricky or there are other hazards to negotiate. Once armed, the operator can make a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test to reveal the origins of local vox transmissions, which it can search out to an absolute maximum of five kilometers (conditions permitting). A simple success merely indicates the presence of voxcasters and their direction from the tracker, while one or more degrees of success gives the distance to the nearest hundred meter increment as well as a more precise direction (generally within a 10 degree cone). Three or more degrees of success returns an even more positive result, identifying the exact distance out to a 1d5 meter radius as well as the exact angle and bearing. Failure simply displays a blank screen as if no vox traffic was present in the area.

#### Ward Accessor

There are many areas of Imperial hive cities, forge complexes, void ships, and other built-up areas that are off-limits to most passers-by but which typically can't be staffed by armed guards to gently nudge the overly curious away. A ward accessor is a type of techno-key that is used to gain entry to a given area or areas that utilise more complex electrical or logis-controlled locking and security mechanisms. The shape and style of these devices varies from world to world - more common types include alloy or plastek cards or coins that are read or passed through a scanner, holo wafers that display a specific shape recognized by an electric eye, and small circuit disks that interface with a simple cogitator and carry current at a specific power and modulation that the system expects. Of course, much more grandiose or eccentric varieties exist, including the placing and removal of great seals, inserting staffs or sceptres into ornate receptacles, and so forth, though these are often intended to convey a grandiose sense of awe rather than for any sort of improved security means.

The ward accessor listed here is for a common card-type or coin-type version that is blank and ready to be written with the desired code. Possession of blank accessors is usually not illegal, though it can be highly suspicious.

## Inquisitorial Equipment

As an organisation that moves through shadows and blends seamlessly in with the breadth of Imperial society until the time is right to reveal its holy fury, the Emperor's Inquisition arms and girds itself using a variety of kit, most of which are sourced from mundane and unremarkable origins. However, there exist a few things which simply done exist in the realms of citizen-run manufactora and great industrial cartels. These extremely unusual and esoteric pieces equipment are made to very exacting specifications, either wholly within Inquisition itself or contracted out to large forges who receive exorbitant compensation for their efforts (and face exorbitant wrath should their secrecy ever be compromised). Most serve a particular role to aid an agent of the Inquisition in their duty, while others arguably more simplistic effects that simply have a great significance or portents within the enigmatic organisation. Acolytes of the Inquisition will likely begin to encounter some of these items as they ascend in rank a prestige with their masters.

Despite the Inquisition's diligence, there have been a few instances of these reliquaries turning up in the hands of outsiders - alarming almost always those who would oppose the Holy Ordos.

#### Badge of Office

Many lowly Acolytes never actually meet the masters, carrying on their work in secrecy a convening cells when they receive a code transmission or find a sealed message tube at a dead-drop. Those who have risen in favor however, may find themselves summoned to become a more integrated part of the Conclave, meeting with their betters and taking orders to investigate and destroy far more dangerous foe of man. These valued minions are often entrusted with a Badge of Office that bears the seal of the Inquisition, providing the Acolytes with a very positive form of identification along with a measure of the awesome power that their Inquisitor wields - something that is best employed with discretion. Revealing a Badge of Office unequivocally states "I am in the employ of an Inquisitor - stand in my way at your peril." "Bearing the seal" is thus a common expression within the Holy Ordos meaning that a situation has come to a head.

A Badge of Office typically takes the form of a slate gray of jet black data-slate that is gene-locked to the Acolyte it has been issued to. When grasped by its owner, the Badge displays the unmistakable symbol of the Inquisition and can also offer up certified credentials of the bearer's identity. Less common examples may include an actual badge that displays a holo when activated, an electoo hidden on the arms or torso, and so forth - the only real limit is the Inquisitor's imagination and preferences. 

#### Calixian Black Grimoire

Penned and annotated by a number of illustrious Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave's Ordo Xenos, this volume is nothing less than an encyclopaedic field manual on the nature of known aliens and creatures that threaten the Calixis Sector. The work is as decidedly factual as anything written by the hands of men. It contains the most reliable information available on how to identify, communicate, combat, and destroy a plethora of beings from beyond - with hardly any of the usual inspiring and vindictive tropes that permeate most written material concerning the abominable entities. While it is presumed that the Inquisitor and his retinue will "fill in" all the applicable hatred, the fact that the Black Grimoire is so devoid of condemnation and spite - indeed, whole chapters are dedicated to xenos which can be reasoned and negotiated with - makes it an extremely contentious item within the Conclave itself. Representatives of the Ordo Malleus have demanded that the tomes be kept under close security to prevent their contents from becoming known among the masses, with many arguing that it belongs alongside their own tracts on daemons and the warp inside the hermetic vaults. The witch hunters of the Ordo Hereticus have made even more of an issue of the volume, claiming that to even pen such damning filth is a grand heresy in and of itself, the firebrands even going so far as to threaten their peers in the Ordo Xenos who bear copies of the folios. Ever the ones to walk dangerous lines, the Xenos agents themselves who happen to obtain a Grimoire have taken to wearing them openly in Conclave communions merely to antagonize their fellows.

The original Calixian Black Grimoire's whereabouts are unknown, but copies have been made and imprinted on special hand-crafted data-slates. A reproduction Grimoire is contained in a glossy black polyflex housing that opens much like a clasped book to reveal dual screens - the left displays text while the right automatically cycles through picts, charts, and illustrations as relevant for the written content. The Grimoire further contains a miniaturised gene-sampler which can confirm samples of spoor as belonging to any of the creatures that the volume has information on. Each Black Grimoire is encrypted with a gene-lock that grants only its owner access - anyone else opening the slate causes it to immolate itself as a security precaution, leading some among the Ordo Hereticus to refer to it as "the book so wicked it burns itself".

A Calixian Black Grimoire grants a +10 bonus on Research Tests involving Ciphers (Occult), Scholastic Lore (Legend), and Forbidden Lore (Cults, Daemonology, and/or Warp). The bonus increases to +20 for Forbidden Lore (Xenos).

#### Liber Excruciatus

This book exists in a variety of editions and printings, often penned by different authors or gathered from disparate collections, but in all cases it presents a very thorough dissertation on various means of interrogation and prying information from those who'd rather not give it. The heavy leather-bound tomes look almost as imposing as the verses and diagrams contain often bracketed by dull iron or lusterless copper hardware to further the appearance. although they are an Inquisitorial fixture, actual Interrogators only keep a copy for sentimental or introspective purposes, leaving the actual hands-on work to the undoubtedly less messy excruciator. Of course, there are those who genuinely enjoy that sort of hands-on work, and may keep a bloodstained copy of the Liber Excruciatus handy at all times for that purpose.

Reading off various gory procedures from the Liber Excruciatus grants a +10 bonus on Intimidate Tests made against characters who are restrained and believe they're in imminent peril of being subjected to the verses. Actually using the book's techniques and methods as part of an interrogation grants a +10 bonus to the Interrogation Test, but also inflicts 1d5 levels of Fatigue on the captive with each Test as well as 1d5 points of Damage plus the interrogator's Willpower Bonus. This Damage isn't reduced by the captive's Toughness Bonus owing to the especially creative (read: sadistic) methods.

#### Liber Heresius
 
Containing the collected wisdom, musings, anecdotes and philosophies of a thousand famed witch hunters, the Liber Heresius is the definitive guide to heresy in its various permutations. Detailed notes and explanations on the structure, activities, and nature of many infamous cults and heretics, as well as how they were discovered and their corruption rooted out, fill this tome's heavy rigid pages. The book itself has a solid metallic cover and binding with a gene-coded clasp, creating a very sturdy and impressive-looking reference that is emblazoned with the symbol of the Inquisition. Aside from a mere chronicle of the Ordo Hereticus' great accomplishments and purgations, the book also contains a great many manuscripts and treatises on how to identify incipient heresy, recognize signs and symbols commonly used by heretics, and how to be cognizant of subtle creeds and mottoes used by those who ferment such crimes. While the Liber Heresius is a valuable volume for research and preparation in striking down heresy wherever it may appear, it could just as easily be used as an all-points-covered manual on how to start a cult and keep it hidden too. As a result, only the most trusted of the witch hunters are allowed to obtain a copy of their own, and must surrender it to the Conclave at a moment's notice without protest.

Having a copy of the Liber Heresius on hand grants a +20 bonus to Research Tests involving Forbidden Lore (Cults and/or Heresy). Each book is gene-locked to a single owner and will steadfastly refuse to open in the hands of anyone else. Only high-ranking members of the Inquisition's inner circles know the means to defeat the security mechanisms without also destroying the book's content as well.

#### Psy-Tracker

Also known as an aetheroscope, a psy-tracker is a novel type of scanner that can monitor disturbances in the empyrean and analyse psychic fluctuations. As might be expected, they are imminently useful tools for locating and hunting down witches and rouge psykers, making them a favorite pieces of kit for militant witch hunters. The device resembles an overbuilt auspex with a hardened case is inlaid with wires that slightly rise up from the housing, creating a textured appearance. There is no apparent display - the psy-tracker is designed to be wired into a photo-visor where it overlays its findings. This capability makes an especially potent tool if combined with a psy-occulum, ensuring that almost no witch could hide from the piercing gaze of the Inquisition. While many within the Holy Ordos regard these implements of discovery as sacred and revered tools, some have noted with a degree of bemusement that the inner workings of a psy-tracker are uncannily similar to devices used to monitor a void ship's Geller field and the systems that create it. Also known as an aetherosc disturbances in the empyreaychic fluctuations. As might be expected, they are imminently useful tools for locating and hunting down witches and rogue psykers, making them a favorite piece of kit for militant witch hunters. The device resembles an overbuilt many fine sensory 

The user of a psy-tracker must have the Tech-Use Skill, though no Tests are necessary under normal operation. When connected to a photo-visor or other suitable display, a psy-tracker allows the user to make Awareness Tests to determine the location and relative strength of psychic forces and disturbances, the presence of daemons and psykers (or vacillating signs of recent passage), and any lingering effect that a psychic emanation may leave. The difficulty of the Test will vary depending on the situation, especially if the target is deliberately trying to suppress their psychic "signature". A psy-tracker has an effective range out to several hundred meters, though very powerful occurrences, such as an alpha-class psyker immolating an entire convent or a demonically-possessed cruiser appearing from the warp in low orbit, can register from great distances. Energy fields, such as magnetic containment housings of plasma reactors, along with psychic "background noise" can confuse a psy-tracker, and a user would be well-advised to use discretion when pursuing what the tracker believes is a dangerous witch.

Action or Invocation A psyker can make use of a psy-tracker to augment his own seeking abilities, but the device can't be used in any Round in which the psyker channels his gifts, such as making a Focus Power Test, or sustaining a Psychic Power.

#### Psyocculum

These thick, opaque black goggles are rimmed with powerful miniaturized scanners and etheric probes just beneath the surface of the sturdy housing, all of which are processed through a pair of tiny logis stacks to project a visual cue around psychic beings that the wearer lays his eyes on. While much more simplistic and primitive compared to a proper aetheroscope, a psyocculum is effectively "always on" and requires no physical manipulation to invoke its powers - as long as the wearer has a keen and suspicious eye, witches and daemons will not escape detection. A psyocculum includes a plug that allows it to be connected to a full psy-tracker, giving the righteous bearer a more in-depth spectrum of witch-finding, and may include other faculties as well depending on the design and orders of the commissioner.

A psyocculum allows the wearer to make Psyniscience Tests with a +20 bonus, but only to detect the presence of daemons or psykers that are hiding in sight. If the wearer is observing the being the psyocculum will superimpose a shimmering aura around them, the intensity of which can be used as a general gauge of the creature's psychic strength. For an extra 200 Thrones a psyocculum can also have a photo-visor's amplification features built in to the lens, allowing the wearer to see in areas of darkness. A psyocculum's heavy construction means it also protects the wearer's eyes from injury just like a pair of blast goggles.

#### Rosette

A rosette appears to be little more than a simple cast metallic badge, typically of a rare metal or alloy, which recreates the icon of the Inquisition. The badge is about 15 centimeters long and is meant to be worn around the neck, though it can also be stowed up a sleeve or pocket. Despite its plain appearance, a rosette is one of the most powerful objects in the Imperium as it grants its bearer the full rights an d responsibilities of an Inquisitor of the Holy Ordos. Producing this symbol can compel Imperial citizens to perform all matters of tasks and duties, requisition equipment and men, denounce a traitor, and indeed, can save (or destroy) entire worlds through the force of the Inquisitor's will, influence, and power. Each rosette is hand-crafted when an Inquisitor is first elevated to that lofty title, presented to them as the ultimate mark of their authority, and interred or cremated with the wearer when his service to the Emperor ends (whenever the situation permits, at least). Extremely ancient or crippled Inquisitors may voluntarily enter a state of quasi-retirement where they dedicate themselves to research and cultivation of new young men in the employ of the Inquisition, sharing the priceless wealth of their experiences and exploits - but none ever truly hang up their rosette.

A rosette can only be acquired when one ascends to the rank of Inquisitor, and each is individually crafted with some input by the soon-to-be bearer. Aside from being a physical representation of the Inquisitor's awesome power, a rosette will also typically have a highly sophisticated data-probe integrated into its shape, which is drawn out on a tiny hair-like fiber. Many logis-gates used in electrical security systems can be over ridden by an Inquisitor's rosette - no Tests are required, the device either cooperates or it doesn't. Finally, a rosette is individually gene-locked to its Inquisitor using a sophisticated micro-cogitator that can detect the movements of the badge. If presented in any stern way, as Inquisitors are wont to do, while being held by anyone else the rosette will violently explode, likely blowing up the impostor in a spectacular fashion that invokes a sense of divine retribution (the action itself is carried out by a miniaturized melta bomb).

#### Sentinel Array

A techno-wonder to rival all others, a sentinel array makes a common auspex look like a stripling's toy. The wondrous device compacts incredibly sophisticated motion trackers, heat detectors, acquisition and logis systems, guidance cogitators, predictor suites, and other forms of electronic sensory input into a housing no larger than a common backpack, tho w scanners and optical sensors peek out above the user's shoulders. Considering that much equipment usually makes up an orbital spy platform, this is no mere feat of Mechanicus miniaturization but a virtual miracle of technology - fitting, then, that it should arm the Inquisition for hunting extremely elusive targets. When its powerful and aggressive machine spirits are coaxed into action, a sentinel array provides an unbelievable amount of information about the immediate environment. No mere display or screen can possibly contain all the torrent of data that the array compiles - only piping the array's output into the user's brain directly, typically using a cerebral plug, will suffice. Once properly configured and affixed, the sentinel array's powerful detection and scanning features permit the user to track a target through dense underbrush, crowded streets, and even through solid walls. The expanded perception grants the array's user a stunning new perspective on their surroundings, though a mental overload is possible from the sheer volume of sensory input flooding the user's mind. This factor, along with their extreme rarity and expense, limits their deployment to all but the most trusted agents of the God-Emperor.

A character must have a cerebral plug, mind impulse unit, or some other method to directly connect their mind to the sentinel array's data feeds. Once fully linked to the array, the user gains a +30 bonus to all Awareness Tests as well as the Unnatural Senses trait. The character can functionally "see" in all directions (enemies gain no bonus for ganging up on the user) and even through solid matter that is less than one meter thick, though only for specific targets that the user makes an Awareness Test to locate. The sentinel array can also "lock on" to a single target that the wearer is aware of, keeping that quarry isolated in the user's mind so that no possible combination of Concealment, Shadowing, or other such subterfuge can fool the user's gaze. Activating this tracking feature is a Half Action, though if the array has been pre-loaded with a sample of the target's gene-spoor it requires no action whatsoever. These various faculties can all be used up to a range of 50 meters save for the target tracking feature, which has twice the effective range. The array's internal power cells have enough energy for up to 10 hours of use before they must be recharged via a high-induction power conduit.

Using a sentinel array can completely incapacitate a character who lacks the cranial fortitude to actually process the immense data-stream it produces. Each time the user activates the sentinel array and for every continuous minute of user thereafter the user must succeed on a Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test or suffer 1d5 levels of Fatigue as their mind is over stressed by the array's flood of information. A psyker can use a sentinel array, but attempting to use the Psyniscience Skill or manifesting a psychic power while the array is active causes its machine spirits to rebel against the warp incursion from the psyker's mind. The psyker must pass a Very Hard (-30) Willpower Test or suffer 1d10 levels of Fatigue as well as the array shutting down in protest.

#### Simulacrum Imperialis

A Simulacrum Imperialis is a holy symbol carried by an Imperial saint, though fragments of a saint's bones and other such reliquary items have been known to be used as well. No simple charm or whimsical seal, a Simulacrum Imperialis carries great power among the faithful, and militant Inquisitors of the Ordo Hereticus leading a convent of the Adepta Soroitas into battle have been known to bring one of these relics to the field to inspire and embolden their charges. A Simulacrum Imperialis, regardless of the specific form it takes, can be considered one of the most holy relics that one would dare remove from its proper resting place, and the rarity of the icons alone can represent a considerable amount of their power and potency. To wield a Simulacrum Imperialis is to defiantly stand in the face of heresy and corruption demanding its strongest come forth and face retribution.
  
Whenever a character spends a Fate Point within a 20 meter radius of a strongly displayed Simulacrum Imperialis the character has a 30% chance to immediately recover it. Roll 1d10 - on a result of 8, 9, or 10, the character recovers the Fate Point as if it had never been spent in the first place. This effect can only be used by who have 10 or fewer Corruption Points, the holy relics having no succor for those who harbor wickedness in their hearts. If the character burns a Fate Point it is still permanently lost as usual.

#### Spy Mask

Only issued to the sinister and little known operatives of the Officio Assassinorum, a spy mask is an incredibly sophisticated headgear that crams an astounding sensorum suite in a tiny package as well as a plethora of other useful features that can aid an assassin in the execution of their tasks (and their targets). The multi-spectrum visor is linked to micro-sized scanners and detectors, with a cogitator stack no larger than a few coins sitting above the right ear to process the flow of data into visual displays for the assassin's pleasure. An assassin armed with a spy mask is therefore always a few paces ahead of his mark, able to travel light and move swiftly with the benefit of a lorry's worth of intel-gathering gear at his disposal at all times. Aside from the espionage and surveillance equipment, a spy mask also includes super-compact ration cartridges that can be retrieved with the tongue should the assassin find himself in a mission where stopping to acquire foodstuffs would pose an unacceptable risk to the mission. 

A character wearing a spy mask has access to all the features of an auspex, magnoculars, micro-bead, photo-visor, pict-recorder, re-breather, and vox-caster, all of which can be considered to be of Best Craftsmanship for determining ancillary effects based off of item quality. In addition to the above, the wearer is entitled to re-roll any failed Perception based Tests, and can ignore the effects of an enemy wearing chameleoline when making ranged attacks against them. A spy mask is gene-coded to the assassin it is issued to and will not function for any other, though it may be possible to adjust the gene-coding to another user. Such an endeavor requires a suitably advanced facility with gene-writing equipment and successful Arduous (-40) Tech-Use and Medicae Tests, with any failure resulting in the spy mask's advanced features being ruined.

#### Stealth Suit

This highly advanced version of synskin is whole leagues more complex and capable than the lesser style of body gloves, and is produced within the Officio Assassinorum exclusively for its deadly agents - even magi of the Martian Priesthood have been unable to get their mechadendrites on this exquisite equipment to attempt to divine its functions. Cameleoline is heavily impregnated into the material, causing the wearer to actively blend in with their surroundings, and the suit does more than simply bond to the wearer's skin - it actually grafts itself into their tissues, extending micro-fibers that link into the assassin's nerves. While unnerving to experience, the stealth suit augments an assassin's already superb reflexes and responses while steeling them against poisons and toxic gas. Combined with its supple, silent motion, an assassin clad in a stealth suit can effortlessly move through most environments while stalking his prey and waiting for the right moment to strike.

A stealth suit grants all the benefits of Best Craftsmanship synskin as well as a chameleoline cloak or coating and a permanently active stummer. It further provides its wearer with a +10 bonus on Dodge Tests as well as Toughness Tests made to resist any kind of poison, including ingested toxins, and finally permits the wearer to make Concealment Tests even while being observed. Once donned, the stealth suit can only be removed by the assassin, though a particularly dedicated adversary might be able to physically cut it free from an assassin's form. A stealth suit is gene-coded to the assassin it is issued to and will not function for any other, though it may be possible to adjust the gene-coding to another user. Such an endeavor requires a suitably advanced facility with gene-writing equipment and successful Arduous (- 40) Tech-Use and Medicae Tests, with any failure resulting in the stealth suit becoming an inert mass of matte black gel.

#### Witch Cage

There are times when a rogue psyker or witch simply can't be dealt with in the proper fashion at once. Regardless of what extenuating circumstances may exist, those wishing to keep a dangerous psyker captive would do well to bear a witch cage. This simple-looking wrought iron box is planted on the psyker's head. Both sides of its major surfaces are deeply etched with runes and wards, the pentagrams on the inside cutting off the psyker from calling on the warp while the hexagrams on the outside prevent any other warp-spawned beings from breaking through to the trapped mind within. The sturdy box also prevents the psyker from seeing his surroundings and the heavy construction mutes sound as well, which combined with the loss of warp attunement can have powerfully disorienting effects on the captive. Finally, the witch cage is lined with points and rings - these are used to encourage the psyker to cooperate, typically by slapping the box or pulling on ropes run through the rings, all of which will inflict pain but are unlikely to cause real injury.  Most are easily corralled by a witch cage, but an august and prudent witch hunter would take heed when using one on a rogue psyker that has truly given themselves over to their dark patrons. A witch cage is held in place by fairly simple buckles and straps, possibly including a padlock, so it is in the witch hunters' best interests to make sure their captive is physically restrained to prevent them from simply pulling the cage off.

A witch cage reduces a psyker's effective Psy Rating by 4 and imposes a -40 penalty to Invocation and Psyniscience Tests. Anyone else attempting to use a psychic power to contact the psyker or affect the psyker's mind must succeed on a Very Hard (-30) Willpower Test or else the witch cage blocks out their efforts. If the psyker is actually able to manifest a psychic powes or succeed on an Invocation or Psyniscience Test, the witch cage's wards glow brightly to warn his captors. The witch cage's construction causes its wearer to be considered Blinded and imposes a -30 penalty on any sound-based Awareness Tests as long as their head is stuck in it.

## Augmetics

Though cast in the image of the God-Emperor, a human body can be frustratingly frail when one considers the myriad forms of death and injury that exist in the 41st Millennium. Enter the blessings of the Adeptus Mechanicus: the red-robed priests of Mars are able to create marvelous constructions of techno-artifice that can not only replicate various functions of the body but can further expand and empower the capabilities of those who are willing to turn their bodies into the artistic playthings of skilled chirurgeons. Some cyber-enhancement can extend a man's lifespan beyond its natural limits - combined with juvenant treatments, living into one's third of fourth century isn't out of the question, and particularly enduring souls have pushed on even beyond that. However, some would say that there is a price to pay for replacing one's flesh with alloy and composites far greater than mere gelt. Attitudes towards augmetics very widely in the breath of the Emperor's domains. Backwater and less-developed worlds may view obvious augmetics with suspicion, fear, or even revulsion, while inversely the lay members of the Adeptus Mechanicus are virtually expected to pare away their weak biologics in favor of a shape more holy to the Machine God.

Most augmetics can be classified into two primary groups. Bionics replace limbs, organs, and other anatomy, often as a prosthetic to remedy grievous injuries. Most are designed to get a man moving again, though well-made examples might give pause to consider chopping off a perfectly healthy limb. Implants are the opposite, typically adding some kind of capability or talent that the bearer did not have before and expanding the versatility of his form. 
### ATTACHING AN AUGMETIC

Aside from the augmetic itself, a character must also have access to a skilled chirurgeon and the proper medicae facilities to undergo the attachment and recuperation period, though an already heavily augmented tech-priest may be able to operate on his own body. For most men, the operation and recovery period takes 2d10 days - a character who wishes to get back into action more quickly can reduce the total by his Toughness Bonus to a minimum of 1. The medicae performing the procedure must succeed on a Medicae Test whose difficulty is determined by the type of augmetic - having access to more advanced facilities can reduce the difficulty to some extent. A critical failure can have potentially lethal consequences; something anyone who is considering a voluntary augmetic "upgrade" should consider carefully.
### BIONICS

A bionic is often the most immediately recognizable type of augmetic as many tend to be quite obvious in their construction. A man who's lost a limb or suffered crushing organ damage can usually be returned to health and vitality by sawing off or scooping out the failing tissues and replacing them with sturdy, reliable machinery.

Many bionics have secondary effects depending on their type and Craftsmanship. As a general rule of thumb, a bionic limb increases the bearer's Toughness Bonus by 2 for the purposes of reducing Damage from hits to that area - alloy and pistons are simply more durable than flesh and bone. Likewise, Critical Damage to a bionic limb may be less fatal to the bearer - a condition that causes Blood Loss instead causes the limb to cease functioning until repaired, while a violent amputation that would ordinarily be immediately lethal only has a 30% chance of actually killing the character, though they still incur all the other penalties and impediments for suffering the Critical Damage itself. Depending on the nature of the bionic, it may be possible to repair the damage, or the character could have to seek out a new replacement.

Some types of bionics grant a bonus to Tests to reflect their superior quality. The bonus only applies to Tests made with that bionic directly, and having two of the same bionic does not grant double the bonus unless otherwise stated.

#### Bionic Arm

Losing an arm greatly affects a man's effectiveness in almost every situation, and it is not entirely uncommon for a valued labourer to be fitted with a bionic replacement at the expense of his betters so as to continue his utility. A bionic arm can replace part of or the entire human limb, up to and including a sturdy bracket implanted at the shoulder to serve as a firm anchor point. Most bionic arms are controlled by a synth-nerve bundle which can sometimes be seen as a slightly raised line under the bearer's skin. A whole arm replacement is typically wired directly to the bearer's brain, while a bionic hand is usually connected to existing synaptic fibers in the arm. The bionic's Craftsmanship has further effects on the bionic's utility and functions.

If the character only requires a replacement hand rather than the entire arm, the base cost of the arm decreases by half, though it no longer grants the increased Toughness Bonus to resist Damage like the full bionic limb would.

**Poor**: While rudimentary in function, a cheap bionic arm is still vastly preferable to a clumsy wire-controlled pincer or having no arm at all. These limbs are typically more bulky than the flesh they replaced and have a more limited range of motion than others, including fingers that can only be moved small increments independently - the bearer can grasp and grip without difficulty, but fine dexterous tasks are notably more difficult, and the sense of touch is perceptibly imprecise. This type of augmetic is most commonly seen among maimed citizens who have received a replacement from their guild or commercial house - those who have enough gelt to their name would typically pay for a more advanced bionic.

Poor bionic arms halve the bearer's Agility when used to make Tests requiring fine manipulation, such as positioning thin wires into a conduit, and impose a -5 penalty to Weapon and Ballistic Skill Tests made using that arm. This penalty may not apply in certain situations, such as using the off hand to steady a basic ranged weapon.

**Common:** An average bionic arm can fully replicate all the functions of the flesh it replaces, including a proper motion and manipulation of the fingers. The limb gently whirs and hums as it moves, but is otherwise fully responsive and can duplicate a sense of touch with a good degree of accuracy. Bearers who are well acquainted with their arm's functions can also manually disable some of its senses, in receptors, which can be useful should the bearer have to reach into a caustic acid to retrieve a lost object or disable a hot valve panel that would ordinarily cause painful burns.

**Good**: Well built and showing its superb level of workmanship, these high-grade arms are actually more nimble and flexible than what the Emperor blessed them with at birth. Unless otherwise desired by the bearer, a Good Craftsmanship bionic arm is precisely the same size and dimensions as the arm it replaced, and can be easily concealed under a long sleeve and glove. Many who have the wealth to afford such a fine augmetic choose to do quite the opposite, however, bearing the limb proudly to show off a glossy or engraved finish that can be further accentuated with inlaid gemstones, rare metals, or even lumen-fibers that glow as the limb's motors and servos move. Even with a whimsical or effete appearance, however, a high quality arm is  also notably stronger than the bearer's muscles and bone would have been. 

A good bionic hand or arm grants the bearer a +10 bonus on Agility-based Tests where fine manipulation is concerned; the full arm also grants a +10 bonus on Strength Tests to lift or pull heavy objects with that arm as well as increasing the bearer's Strength Bonus by 1 when calculating melee weapon damage and thrown weapon range. If the bearer possesses two good bionic arms these bonuses stack when both are being used (for example, wielding a melee weapon with two hands).

#### Bionic Cardiac System

Disease, injury, or decadence can all damage or destroy a man's heart and arteries, and no matter how good of physical shape the body might be in, it will wither and die without adequate flow of life-giving blood. A bionic cardiac system can partly or fully replace the bearer's heart and major arteries with a strong mechanical replacement and vat-grown tissues for the finer bits, ensuring that whatever frailty eventually claims them most certainly won't be an infarction. The sturdy heart itself is typically mounted in a solid brace that attaches to the bearer's rib cage to prevent the device from pressing on other organs, and small metal plates may be visible on the bearer's chest to indicate the anchoring points, one of which will typically have a data-port to verify the heart's vitals. Aside from this reinforcement, the cardiac system's efficient pumping and oxygen infusers can improve the bearer's athletic ability as well, though care must be taken not to over stress the body - overeager users have been know to catastrophically damage the other areas of their circulatory system, including causing cranial hemorrhaging and other unpleasantness. 

A bionic cardiac system grants the bearer the Sprint talent, though overuse of it causes the bearer to gain two levels of Fatigue instead of the usual one. Additionally, the installation and mounting strengthens the upper torso, granting 1 AP to the Body location that stacks with armor worn. A Good Craftsmanship system fully conceals itself under the wearer's flesh with no obvious plates or raised areas, and lease bio-coagulants into the bloodstream if the bearer is suffering from Blood Loss. This is a passive effect that reduces the character's chance to die each Round to 5%.

#### Bionic Locomotion

Without the use of one or both legs, a citizen is very literally half the man he was before. This eminently crippling condition can lay low men of any stature or office, which is why virtually anyone with the means to do so acquires a bionic replacement to get them back up to size. Bionic locomotion can re place a significant amount of damaged or missing anatomy anywhere from a lost foot up to entire legs and the pelvic region. Because they tend to be simpler and require less sophisticated synth-nerve bundling, the greater mass and utility of bionic legs is typically less costly and more available than other types of prosthetic bionics. Within the Imperial Guard is type of bionic is a notably common sight - veteran troopers who've lost a leg or two due to enemy mines or vehicular accidents are considered to be easily worth the price of the augmetic. Some legions and regiments will award cheaper bionics to low-ranked volunteers or even conscripts as well, typically as part of a demobilization, though how many crippled Guardsmen are so gifted can depend widely on the nature of their conflict. Compared to a bionic arm, bionic feet, legs, or hips are typically wired directly into the base of the bearer's spinal column, so aside from the limbs themselves there is usually little sign of further tampering with their biology. The bionic's Craftsmanship has further effects on the bionic's functions.

This augmetic presumes that the character needs two new legs and possibly some reconstructive work done to the hips and pelvis. If only one leg is being replaced the base cost is decreased by half. The cost is decreased by half again if the character is just in need of an augmetic foot, though in this case it no longer grants the increased Toughness Bonus to resist Damage like the full bionic limb would. 

**Poor:** Inexpensive and quickly produced, this sort of bionic is meant to be better than a pair of crutches and little more, though it succeeds there admirably. Cheap locomotive bionics will have a reduced range of motion and flexibility compared to healthy muscle and bone, usually lacking individual toes in favor of a simpler mitten-like sole and heel. They also tend to have a disquieting appearance, possibly with overbuilt joints or exposed gas-tube absorbers instead of a solid chassis that would more closely mimic the human leg's shape. Of course, even with all these shortcomings, a cheap bionic is almost invariably a better option than hobbling around with a cane or crutch.

Poor Craftsmanship bionic locomotion hinders the bearer's movements in some fashion: depending on the particular method of construction, the augmetics are either less than perfectly stable or over sized and clunky. At the bearer's discretion, he either halves his Movement Rates (round up) or suffers a -20 penalty to Dodge Tests. The penalty must be chosen at the time the augmetic is attached. Regardless of which penalty the bearer suffers, he must also succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Agility Test to avoid stumbling and falling over at the end of any Run movement.

**Common:** Average augmetics closely duplicate the functions and abilities of the limbs they replaced. Once the bearer has gotten used to the sturdier construction and wholly different feel of striding on metal instead of flesh they can largely continue on with no impediment. Unless otherwise dictated during the crafting and forging process, components of Common bionic locomotion mimic the shape and general utility of human limbs, including all the normal joints and appendages. If covered with clothes and properly-sized footwear the bionic could not only pass for flesh and bone but sounds no differently as well.

If the character is replacing both legs, they may also choose to voluntarily increase or decrease their height by up to 10 centimeters to reflect limbs that are deliberately slightly taller or shorter than the bearer's original flesh. 

**Good:** This type of augmetic is made almost exclusively to commission for those who desire better limbs than the God-Emperor gave them. By flatly discarding the typical shape of the human leg in favor of a much more energy efficient profile, the bearer can move with unnatural grace and speed over uneven terrain. The legs themselves look unsettling in motion, however, typically being articulated backwards and able to extend or contract a significant distance to cover much wider strides. They are also tipped with claw-like digits that are evenly spaced, making the bearer very stable as he runs, though they preclude wearing many types of common footwear. The augmented owner of these fine legs will typically opt for a wardrobe that focuses more heavily on robes and cloaks as they can reasonably hide his strange mechanical anatomy, at least at low speeds.

Good Craftsmanship bionic legs must be installed as a pair - walking normally on just one would be impossible. A character fitted with this type of augmetic gains the Unnatural Speed trait and takes only half the usual penalties associated with moving through Difficult Terrain. At the commissioner's discretion they can also have the buffer pads removed from the digits and outfit them with wickedly sharp flensing claws. The character can make attacks with his feet as though he was wielding two Best Craftsmanship mono-edged combat knives, but the eerie tinkering noise of the points on any kind of solid surface imposes a -20 penalty on Silent Move Tests. For an extra 500 thrones the character can integrate a power blade into each foot instead, though the weapons must be obtained separately and impose penalties and benefits per their Craftsmanship as usual.
 
#### Bionic Respiratory System

Having a healthy windpipe and lungs is almost as essential to human biology as a heart and arteries, but a bewildering array of factors can weaken or cripple a man's breathing power. Toxic gases, exposure to super heated air, molds and diseases, and even chronic lho-stick smoking can all leave a man wheezing and out of breath from even minor exertion, never mind a puncture wound from a bullet or blade. A bionic respiratory system uses cyclonic pumps to inflate and deflate artificial membranes that replace the bearer's lungs. Tiny scrubber fibers introduce oxygen into the bloodstream, providing the necessary respiration for muscles and organs they also have the added effect of acting as an efficient toxin filter, which increases the appeal of replacing healthy organs for those who often work amid noxious environs.

A bionic respiratory system provides a +20 bonus on Toughness Tests made to withstand inhaled toxins and poison gases. The Craftsmanship of the augmetic has other effects on its utility and functions.

**Poor:** These augmetics are perfectly functional and provide their bearer with full, life-sustaining breaths, but the cheap cyclonic pumps make a clearly audible wheezing noise as the bearer respires. The implanting procedures are also more haphazard in nature, which often leaves very visual scarring on the bearer's torso where his failing organs were removed.

Cheap bionic respiratory systems impose a -20 penalty on all Silent Move Tests, even if the character attempts to hold his breath.

**Common**: Perfectly replicating the bearer's original flesh, an average bionic respiratory system is designed to have minimal effect on the bearer's daily habits and proclivities. If implanted carefully, the procedure leaves minimal disruption to the bearer's torso, with only a telltale clicking noise being heard at close distances as the valve caps cycle within their chest. While not an intended effect, lho-stick smokers often quit the habit as the action invariably ends up feeling less satisfying.

Common bionic respiratory systems impose a -5 penalty on Silent Move Tests, even if the character attempts to hold his breath.

**Good:** An unquestionably superior bionic respiratory system is created by omitting the cyclonic pumps entirely in favor of custom bio-gill filters that are attuned to the bearer's own bodily rhythms and humors. These lungs are both silent and far more efficient than lesser augmetics due to their folded and structured membranes hosting many times the amount of scrubber fibers. Their ancillary effects on the bearer's biology tend to appeal more to those who have the Thrones to burn on enhancing their bodies than cripples and men who spend long days pooling caustic substances, however, by and large making them "augmetics of choice" more than anything else.

Good Craftsmanship bionic lungs increase the bonus on Toughness Tests to resist toxins to +30, and further allow the character to hold his breath for four times as long as normal (see Suffocation on page 210 of _Dark Heresy_ more information).

#### Bionic Weapon Attachment

Although only commonly employed by militant tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus, a bionic arm can be configured to conceal smaller types of weapons within its frame. Rearrangement of the bionic's internal structures can make room for the operating parts of most types of pistols and bladed melee weapons to be partly or fully hidden within. Pistol-type weapons tend to be constructed in-line with the arm's longitudinal axis, the muzzle lying flush with the palm to release its projectiles from the bearer's outstretched hand. Blades can be mounted in a number of ways, including sliding, swinging, or scissoring actions, though in general the weapon extends along the arm's line and is swung accordingly. A bionic weapon attachment can be quite a boon in situations where weapons can't be bared openly, though it may be of little use in circumstances where the bionic itself sticks out badly.

 A bionic weapon attachment can mount any pistol or small melee weapon, such as a chain knife or power blade, completely concealing it from view until the weapon is used. While the weapon is hidden only an auspex scan can reveal it, though those familiar with such augmetics may be able to recognize the signs of such a mounting if the bearer's bionic arm is not covered by clothing. A weapon that is integrated as a bionic weapon attachment can't be Disarmed, but if the weapon Jams or Overheats it also partially disables the arm until the character clears it (or it cools down). The bionic attachment also allows the character to keep a hand free that would ordinarily wield the weapon, though shooting may have unfortunate consequences for whatever the hand is holding.

#### Cybernetic Senses

Ocular and aural augmetics are fairly common bionic systems in the Imperium - the small mass of the sensorum combined with close proximity to the brain make for relatively easy attachment and replacement. Giving that being blind or deaf can drastically lower one's usefulness in many trades and levels of society, those that wish to stay out of begging would do well to obtain an augmetic replacement. The exact construction and procedure depends on the sense. Ocular augmetics usually make use of sophisticated pict-recorders and vid-casters that run through compact logis stacks to convert their signals into neural impulses that the bearer's mind can understand as sight, while aural augmetics perform a similar translation via vox pickups and microphones. While not nearly as common, cybernetic replication of touch and taste are not unheard of, though these tend to use significantly more esoteric methods such as vat-grown tongues with far more taste buds than normal or super-fine circuitry implanted below the skin of the fingers. Regardless of the sense and the exact method of replication, the Craftsmanship of the augmetic has other effects on its utility and functions.

**Poor:** The use of cheap components and basic logis translators causes a somewhat less than perfect emulation of the sense in question, although an inferior sense is certainly better than none at all. Bionic eyes may present a monochromatic picture that stutters or has narrowed peripheral perception, ears are missing high or low frequency receptors or easily pick up unwanted interference, and so forth. The augmetics themselves are also obviously artificial and over sized as no attempt has been made to create a less obtrusive appearance. Adepts and lexmechanics, among others who don't require a high degree of precision in their labors, tend to be seen with these augmetics with the most frequency, leading to derisive prods about bumbling archivists and scriveners on many worlds throughout the Sector.

Poor Craftsmanship senses duplicate the most important aspects of the sense but are always lacking in at least one area of competence. This imposes a -20 penalty to Tests involving that sense, effectively making it a detrimental version of the Heightened Senses talent. The GM is free to determine what Tests the penalty applies to, as well as other effects the inferior sense may have.

**Common:** Many aspects of Imperial society favor function over appearance and the average sensory augmetic follows this philosophy to the letter. Bionic eyes often take the form of an implanted visor or small metallic plate covering the ocular orbit from which a pict-stealer glares, while ears may partly or totally replace the external lobe with grilles or small, pointed vox pickups, either of which may feature thin cables or wires that run along the contours of the head. However, while their appearance may only be marginally better than cheap augmetics plaguing scribes at the archives, they do produce clear, sharp representations of the sense they replace. This allows the bearer the luxury of deciding how much, if at all, his looks will be inconvenienced by the augmetic's external fixtures and components.

Common Craftsmanship senses replicate the character's normal sensory range almost flawlessly. In addition, a character can connect a data-slate or similar device to a data-port on his augmetic, allowing him to archive what he sees and hears for later analysis (or simple posterity).

**Good:** For those with the gelt to spare, high-quality cybernetics can provide a superior range of sensory input than the flesh while simultaneously looking much less artificial in the first place (if the natural look is desired, of course). Fine bionic eyes actually fit within the bearer's eye sockets, creating a more natural appearance that can be further disguised with the use of colored contact lenses. For aural augmetics, the earlobes are typically spared (jewelry simply does not look as good attached to a metallic plate) with perhaps a small sensor-laden plug visible within the ear or peeking out from the skull behind the lobe - depending on whether or not the bearer is offsetting deafness or merely enhancing his hearing, the biological ears themselves may be no more than decoration while the actual sensory input occurs at the base of the skull. Exterior cables or wiring is well concealed too, perhaps leaving slight raised areas in the skin but little more, and flaps of artificial tissue cover diagnostor plugs and data-ports. In spite of their very unobtrusive appearance, costly augmetics like these can significantly enhance the bearer's senses, such as being able to see into the ultraviolet spectrum or hear ultra high or low frequency noises normally inaudible to the common man.

**Best**: Best Craftsmanship senses duplicate the effects of Common versions and also grant the Heightened Senses talent for the affected skill. further capabilities can be added at the time of the augmetic's creation and attachment - as a general rule of thumb, a cybernetic sense can include the functions of a relevant tool or piece of gear by paying twice the base price of the item in question. Examples could include bionic eyes that include a holo-visor or magnoculars, bionic ears that have a built-in microbead, an augmetic tongue that can detect poison like a poi-savant (without exposing its bearer either), and so on.

#### Gastric Bionics

 Aside from those suffering from tumors or who've been critically injured in combat or via a terrible accident, bionic replacement of the digestive tract is a rare procedure due to complicated surgeries and the limited applications that a mechanical replacement provides. gastric bionics replace the stomach and much of the intestines with augmetic analogues that use artificial membranes combined with enzyme solutions to break down food and drink much like the bearer's original organs did. The digestive enzyme admixture that cycles through the whole system is a minor marvel in and of itself, being collected and purified before being sent back to the beginning of the bionic to commence the process again, though most who bear this augmetic probably give it no further thought than for the minor discomfort and odd flatulence they sometimes experience. Aside from replicating the important digestive functions, gastric bionics also make very effective toxin screens - normally poisonous substances are simply excreted with the rest of the waste instead of being absorbed into the bloodstream. This virtual immunity to poisoned food has made more than a few spire nobles and rich gang lords spring for this augmetic simply to ensure they won't keel over after a fine meal.

Gastral bionics duplicate all the normal biological functions of the digestive tract as well as making the bearer completely immune to almost all ingested poisons and toxins. Best Craftsmanship versions, usually one-off examples made for professional explorers and trackers, allow the bearer to derive nourishment from almost any organic material, though it does nothing to make questionable food sources any more palatable (or remove prickly brambles from the windpipe).

### The Rite of Setesh

Augmetics and juvenant treatments can drastically extend a man's lifespan, but for those on the side of righteousness there is an inevitable end where the soul finally gives up on its withered flesh and aged bionics to meet the God-Emperor. However, with the right lore, skill, and gear, it is said that even death may be overcome, though the price in both gelt and things far less tangible is incredibly steep. The Magos Biologis of the Hippocrasian Agglomeration can perform a sort of complete cyber-construction of a human body in its last stages of decay from age, which is known as The Rite of Setesh in Mechanicus tradition. The Rite completely encases the dying flesh in an augmetic mummy, mechanizing all bodily functions and mobility. Death from age or disease need no longer concern the entombed man within, but being completely devoid of human contact while having only a modicum of the physical freedom they had at their prime can be a ghastly experience in and of itself. It is said that anyone who could possibly want to take such drastic measures against death's eventual embrace is less dreading the end than being judged and found wanting by the Emperor Himself. Most of the lay members of the Mechanicus view the Rite as skirting a very fine line of techno-heresy - after all, even the mightiest and most augmented of magi will one day expire.

The Rite of Setesh is performed over 3d10+10 days as the character is completely swallowed up by a bionic body, leaving only vestiges of their original flesh behind to continue existing (such a condition would be hard to call "living") in perpetuity. The character gains the Machine (4) and Regeneration traits but reduces its Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Agility by half. Wounds and other characteristics are unchanged, though the utterly dehumanizing experience causes the character to gain 2d10 Insanity Points as they grapple with their new state of being. Finally, any Critical Damage suffered by the character increases by 5 owing to the pathetically frail nature of the rotted biology ensconced within.

## Implants

 As the name suggests, this type of augmetic is typically inserted or nestled into the bearer's flesh rather than outright replacing it entirely. A bewildering array of implants can be encountered in the Imperium, with the only real constant between them being that they add some kind of capability or use that the bearer did not have before. Some implant systems can be almost common sights within certain groups well-developed worlds, while others are on fantastically rare and esoteric that are usually made only on a commissioned basis.

#### Auger Implants

Compact yet sophisticated sensorum suites can be physically integrated with the nervous system and brain, granting the bearer enhanced perceptive abilities beyond the fundamental senses. Fiber-thin wires are carefully inserted into different areas of the brain and connected to a tiny logis stack implanted in the base of the skull to process the additional flow of sensory data. Externally, the bearer might sport a few small metallic studs or ports on their head, but on the whole the implant is unobtrusive unless the bearer desires a more dramatic effect (tech-priests are particularly wont to do this, sometimes bearing additional cybernetic eyes or glowing vox detectors). The bearer can activate their augers simply through mental concentration, augmenting or subsuming their normal senses briefly to consult what others could never perceive without the aid of an auspex. Of course, like many other types of scanner, an auger implant isn't infallible and can be prone to interference and "false positive" findings - those who bear these augmetics should reserve their best judgement when their implant and biological senses sharply contradict.

An auger implant duplicates the effects of an auspex in any Round in which the character spends a Half Action to focus on its findings (the Tech-Use Test to use the auger in manual mode can be made as part of the action). Poor Craftsmanship implants function the same but only out to a 20 meter radius due to their smaller and less powerful sensors, while Good Craftsmanship implants allow the character to re-roll failed Perception-based Tests made while using the implant. 
#### Bio-Power Cells

This implant is broadly similar, though far smaller and less powerful, to the potentia coils borne by tech-priests and enginseers of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Flat power cells about the size of a coin are implanted throughout the bearer's body where they are partly subsumed by muscles and other tissues, leaving only a faint outline or small raised areas where thin wires connect them to betray their presence. These advanced cells slowly absorb bio-energy from the bearer's body, building up a charge that can be used for a variety of useful purposes when released from a small port or contact point implanted on the palms or fingertips. The energy released is not nearly strong enough to be used as a weapon, though it could certainly give a sharp jolt that would leave its victim tingling for an hour or so. The intended role of this augmetic s i to make sure the bearer is never left suffering for lack of a quick power charge, such as to re-power a data-slate with an expired energy cell, but more than a few eccentric nobles and others with gelt to burn have received this implant for no other reason than to offer a shocking surprise to their peers and guests who were only expecting a cordial handshake.

Bio-power cells duplicate the effects of a pair of thermal gloves, though they do not offer any protection from extreme heat or cold.

#### Calculus Logi Implant

Miniaturized cogitator cylinders that pump a liquid data medium are wired directly into the bearer's brain, greatly expanding thought processing centers and literally letting him "think faster". A calculus logi implant is of immense utility for archivists and scholars, making sifting through towering stacks of data slates and rolls of parchment seem far less daunting. However, the bearer's improved mental processing can have potentially undesirable side effects, such as spontaneously completing other people's sentences or chronic insomnia. Unlike some mind-enhancing augmetics, a calculus logi can be shut off when the bearer is not in need of its assistance, though its machine spirit can be notably perturbed by this and may gift the bearer with a migraine when reconnected.

A calculus logi implant grants the bearer a +10 bonus on all Logic, Literacy, and Lore Tests made against written or textual materials. If the character has the Total Recall talent, it also grants these bonuses to the character's memories as well. The implant makes it more difficult for the bearer to sleep when it is active - the GM is free to determine what effects, if any, this has in the game. The implant can be switched off to negate this effect, but the bearer must succeed on a Routine (+20) Willpower Test or gain one level of Fatigue due to headaches the next time he activates the implant.

#### Chem Implant

A plethora of drugs and substances exist in the Emperor's domain, and there are almost as many ways to introduce them into the body as well. Almost all rely on some kind of mechanisms, such as needle-tipped syringes or bio-active skin patches While effective at what they do, the process of using the tool can be unacceptably long when seconds are priceless. Chem implants exist to remedy this shortcoming, arming their bearer with the desired drug at a moment's notice and with minimal interaction.

##### Chem Gland: 
No mere mechanical dispenser, a chem gland is an masterpiece of the Magos Biologis - a completely organic device that functions as an ancillary organ which can secrete drugs and chemicals into the bloodstream by muscular compression. Other than perhaps surgical scars, the bearer presents no outward signs of the implant's presence, and its complete lack of machinery means nothing unusual appears on most auspex scans. Even more amazing is the gland's ability to biologically synthesize common drugs by absorbing their core compounds from the bearer's biology. Once the bearer has become familiar with the necessary somatic stimuli to trigger the gland's functions, he need not worry about needles and injectors ever again. 

A chem gland can replicate the effects of any of the following drugs: calmer, de-tox, frenzon, halo, kick, pan-immune, pain-immune, spur, stimm, wide-awake. The gland can build up as many as three doses of the same drug over time, typically taking about a day for each dose. Alternatively, the bearer can "gland" any one drug as a Half Action by succeeding on a Routine (+10) Toughness Test, though this destroys any accumulated doses in the gland. Failure inflicts one level of Fatigue on the character as he overworks his muscles while prodding the gland into action, while failure by four or more degrees causes minor poisoning that inflict 1d10 points of Toughness Damage. Regardless of which, the gland still produces and applies the drug's effects.

##### Injector Rig:
An injector rig is a fairly simple affair that replaces the manipulative aspects of administering drugs with an automatic system that pumps its contents into the bearer's body on command. The function and usage depends heavily on the level of care quality put into the rig, as well as the concern shown to its bearer's well-being and health. This roughly follows the rules for Item Craftsmanship.

Poor: Cheaply made in heretic workshops for ganger heavies or bloodpit fighters, these crude rigs are obviously artificial and over sized, often with hypo-injectors or intramuscular tubes linked to bulky chem canisters sutured to the bearer's back or worn in external pouches. Depending on the exact style and how much care (if any) is used in their attachment, this type implant may more closely resemble the features of a fleshy servitor than a proper augmetic. Their low level of quality, aside from looking less than appealing, can also cause painful or crippling side effects if the external portions of the rig are damaged or malfunction.

Poor injector rigs can store up to ten doses of four different types of drugs, which can be deployed into the character's body as a Half Action. The rig can be designed to administer drugs at the character's direction or remotely via a small control pad, with the latter configuration being commonly used on slave-warriors. In all cases, the character taking any Critical Damage has a 50% chance to trigger potentially fatal toxic poisoning as the injector rig malfunctions. This inflicts 2d10 points of Damage that aren't reduced by Armour or Toughness. 

**Common**: A well-made injector rig integrates more seamlessly with the bearer's form, most frequently making use of evenly distributed synth-bladders and membranous pouches that are hidden among the bearer's muscles and under his skin. These can secrete their contents directly into the bearer's bloodstream via micro-valve implants that directly connect to major veins and arteries. Each bladder or reservoir can be replenished through a tiny port that appears as a small metal plate about one centimeter across which are spread out throughout the body, with the drug being secreted through muscular action or simply applying pressure in a certain motion around the implant. The ports can be disguised with cosmetics or simply by wearing flowing clothes.

Common injector rigs can store up to eight doses of different types of drugs, which can be deployed into the character's body as a Half Action. Each bladder or pouch must be refilled or drained and replaced separately if the character desires to change what sorts of drugs he's carrying. These injector rigs are much more reliable than cheaper versions, but can still be accidentally triggered if the implants are suitably battered. If the character takes any Impact Critical Damage, one of the drugs in the injector rig is randomly administered.

#### Cranial Reinforcement

A man's head is a frighteningly fragile thing, containing his most important organs in a very small area. Having a limb taken off or torso crushed, while life-threatening, may be a survivable injury, and with the aid of augmetics the victim could even be restored to full ability. Losing one's head, however, is virtually always instantly fatal. Imperial medicae frequently make use of composite and alloy bracing to help repair a damaged cranium, but this augmetic goes significantly further and replaces vast areas of the skull's osseous portions with a multilayered plasteel shell. Gel padding on the interior cushions the brain and other sensitive organs, making the bearer's head far better protected than with only natural tissues around it. Of course, cutting out huge swaths of bone creates a dramatic appearance. No two cranial reinforcements look the same, but in general the bearer can expect significant portions of his head to be rendered in gleaming or matte alloy instead of hair and skin, possibly covering or obscuring parts of the face as well. Members of the Adeptus Mechanicus who eagerly replace flesh and bone with metal and composites will often strive to create a strictly mechanical appearance that meshes seamlessly with their respirator units and other cranial implants; those who wish to preserve their existing looks will need to contend with vat-grown tissues and artificial hair implants, which will still likely end up making their head look slightly over sized due to the augmetic's sturdy construction.

Cranial reinforcement adds 1 AP to the character's Head location which stacks with any armor worn. Additionally, if the bearer suffers Impact Critical Damage to the Head location, the reinforcement mitigates some lingering effects. If Stunned, reduce the duration by half; if the character gains levels of Fatigue, reduce the number of levels gained by half (both to a minimum of 1).

#### Cortex Implants

Magos Biologis who often work around the brain and carefully study its functions have come close to perfecting the art of enhancing and replacing cortical functions with compact logis stacks and memory coils. Cortex implants are most frequently used in the control systems for servitors and other types of bonded labor, but more advanced and sophisticated variants can be used to restore most functions of a badly damaged mind. Being exposed to hard void, tissue-destroying vapors and gases, or suffering a catastrophic head injury can reduce a man to an unresponsive plant from which no amount of therapeutic treatment and surgery can redeem. Timely insertion of a cortex implant can rewire the damaged areas of the brain with only a minor loss of cogitation power - a vast improvement to drooling blankly in a hospice! However, a select few magi blessed with a comprehension of the mind and techno-artifice that would baffle most of their peers can go even beyond those limitations to make implants that are arguably better than the grey matter they replace in every way...

The use of cortex implants causes the character to gain 1d10 Insanity Points to reflect more "mechanical thinking" as well as occasional glitches and processing errors that can fool the character's consciousness into misperceiving their own thought processes. Other functions depend on the design and intention of the implants, which roughly follow the rules for Item Craftsmanship.

 **Poor**: Simple, low-density implants control the various biological and neural processes of the bearer's body, but they are insufficient for higher thinking and any sort of independent decision making that does not rely on pre-written control routines and codes. This type of implant is often used to create servitors from existing (rather than vat-grown) bodies, and a more sophisticated style is also employed by the Ecclesiarchy's terrible arco-flagellants.

The use of this type of implant more or less "erases" the character's personality, memories, and other functions. Unless some extenuating circumstances exist, a player character who finds these installed in his head should be removed from play.
 
Common: Most cortex implants aren't quite as good as the tissues they are carefully planted next to, but a character who receives them as part of treatment for a mind-affecting injury likely won't mind too terribly much. Aside from aiding in important mental functions, cortex implants can also be used to suppress or cordon off portions of the bearer's brain that have borne witness to things too horrible to comprehend.

A character who receives this type of implant loses 1d5 points from the character's Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Agility, Intelligence, and Fellowship. The implants can also replicate the effects of the Mind Cleansed Origin (see Origins on page 8 of _The Inquisitor's Handbook_) as they prevent access to damaging memories or experiences. The GM should feel free to subtract some of the character's accumulated Insanity and Corruption Points as well as creating more relevant and appropriate Shards of Memory for the character to experience.

Best: Only a few magi can create these stunningly powerful implants which transcend mere augmetic functions - and they usually install them in their own heads. Instead of repairing, or indeed, augmenting, the bearer's fleshy brain, they completely replace it with an incredible mass of techno-artifice that replaces nerves and synapses with gold relays and crackling data-coils. This type of augmetic is almost never encountered outside of the Adeptus Mechanicus, but rare exceptions do exist. Of course, the bearer might begin acting uncomfortably like a tech-priest if they weren't already one to begin with...

This implant can only be attached and used if the character already has or will be receiving the cranial reinforcement, bionic respiration, and gastric bionics augmetics. Additionally, the character loses any senses (except for touch) that he does not have a cybernetic sense augmetic for. The implant grants the bearer the Unnatural Intelligence (x2) trait (see Unnatural Characteristics on page 332 of _Dark Heresy_ for more information) as well as the Rite of Pure Thought talent if he did not possess it already. His mind can functionally duplicate the effects of an emplaced cogitator, including the ability to connect to other systems through external ports and sockets, and because the entire head is now composed of only mechanical components, he can no longer suffer Blood Loss, Stunning, or Fatigue from attacks that hit there (functionally treat the character as having the Machine trait on his Head location).

#### Exoskeletal Augmetics

These external braces and supports are servo-assisted and duplicate the range of motion of the bearer's limbs and torso with a control unit that is almost invariably hard-linked into the spinal column. More basic models and styles, which are permanently or semi-permanently attached to the bearer's body, can restore mobility to extremely aged or diseased flesh, though those who have suffered severe nerve damage may be able to benefit from this augmetic too. Compared to bionic limbs, an exoskeletal augmetic can enable motion and movement but does not replace so much as "assist" the corporal form. Obviously, it is only suitable for those who still have the extremities the God-Emperor blessed them with. Most are simply devised as a means to treat the impaired who, for any number of reasons, would refuse or could not accept a bionic recovery. Particularly advanced and purpose-designed augmetics do exist, and while rare, they can actually greatly enhance the bearer's physical abilities. Care must be taken in their use to avoid potentially dangerous overexertion of the biology the exoskeleton attaches to.

Exoskeletal augmetics can move parts or all of the character's body even if he would otherwise be unable to, such as through paralysis or serious injury. Characteristic Damage or reduction due to mangled or useless limbs and organs can be totally offset with the use of this augmetic, though only for the purposes of movement and other such actions - for example, scorched lungs that have caused the character to permanently have one level of Fatigue can't be remedied with an exoskeleton. Other functions depend on the design and intention of the implants, which roughly follow the rules for Item Craftsmanship.

**Poor**: While they may appear to be mundane and simplistic, typically composed in the main of slate grey metal, these augmetics can get a man out of a gurney or medi-chair with surprising grace. Because they tend to be somewhat bulky in construction, these augmetics are usually worn outside the bearer's clothing (alterations may need to be made for some attachment points), although more voluminous vestments could conceal their presence.

Poor Craftsmanship augmetics of this type reduce the character's original Movement Rate by 1 and impose a -5 penalty on Weapon Skill Tests, but otherwise grant the bearer a full range of motion and movement again. If the character's condition caused them to completely lose the use of hands and fingers, the exoskeleton can restore those too, but the movement is less than perfect and they reduce their original Agility by half when making any Tests involving fine manipulation. The exoskeleton gently creaks and flexes as the character moves, imposing a - 10 penalty on Silent Move Tests. This augmetic can be removed by the character (the spinal control block remains, of course), though their condition may require the aid of another character to put it back on again.

**Common**: While far less common, exoskeletal augmetics are sometimes used by those who simply desire a body that is more powerful and strongly built without resorting to chopping away their flesh and bones. More advanced exoskeletons are almost always permanently integrated into the bearer's body, their natural tissues augmented by shiny metal bracing and reinforcement which are often further customized and decorated with engraving or glowing power fibers. Aside from the observable parts of the augmetic, the exoskeleton also underpins the bearer's own bones with additional plating - the scars from this heavy surgery are nicely hidden by the augmetic's exterior components. 

Common Craftsmanship augmetics of this type perform the same functions as the Poor Craftsmanship version but impose no penalties save for those on Silent Move Tests. Additionally, the augmetic's reinforcement of the character's body grants them the Bulging Biceps and Iron Jaw talents as well as increasing the Damage of unarmed attacks by 2. This augmetic is permanently integrated with the character's body and can't be removed.

**Good**: Elderly Inquisitors and Rogue Traders who steadfastly refuse to acquiesce to time's inexorable advance will sometimes commission an augmetic of this level of exquisite quality to make sure it won't be frailty of the body that finally does them in. This augmetic closely resembles its lesser variation, but the servo-acutators and nerve input stacks are far more sophisticated and elaborate, quite possibly making the bearer move even faster than they did in their prime. A perfectly healthy man could benefit from this augmetic as well, though usually only those who have built up considerable resources and influence over a lifetime of duty and endeavors could easily afford the great expense.

Good Craftsmanship augmetics of this type perform the same functions as the Common Craftsmanship version but further grant the character the Unnatural Agility (x2) trait as well as granting a +10 bonus on all Agility-based Tests. The character can also attempt a Hard (- 20) Toughness Test to gain the benefits of the Unnatural Speed trait for up to one minute at a time. Failure still grants the trait's benefits but also inflicts 1d5 levels of Fatigue due to placing serious strain on the character's body. Failure by four or more degrees results in the exoskeleton partly tearing away from the character's body, causing him to begin suffering from Blood Loss as well as reducing the augmetic's effects to those of a Poor Craftsmanship version until it receives proper repairs and service.

#### Internal Blade

An augmetic that is almost more of the flesh sculptor's art than anything else, this incredibly precise and finely fitted device is inserted into the muscles and tissues of the bearer's lower arm where it can be used to perfectly conceal a small bladed melee weapon. A skin vent on the wrist allows the weapon to be drawn, typically hilt first, so the augmetic tends to be implanted in the bearer's non-dominant arm. The mechanism itself, resembling an almost paper-thin brace with a tension-assisted slot that deploys the weapon's base, is invariably made of high quality mono-plasteks so it does not appear on an auspex scan, likewise concealing the weapon until the moment it is drawn. Great care must be taken when returning the blade to its augmetic sheath, as a slight error in angling the point can result in missing the skin vent and instead piercing flesh, or worse, arteries in the wrist.

An internal blade can store most bladed knives and similar weapons - including power blades in a hidden augmetic in the character's arm. The weapon can be drawn normally, but slipping it back in requires a Full Action. The implant's base price does not include that of the weapon itself, which must be acquired separately. What melee weapons can be used with this implant are left to the GM's discretion, but should generally be flat in profile and on the small side.

#### Locator Matrix

A locator matrix is an invaluable gift of the Omnissiah to professional explorers and others who frequently operate in distant, unknown lands. Two tiny stacks of micro-cogitators are implanted at the base of the skull and neck, leaving thin parallel strips of shiny metal visible on opposite sides of the spine. The matrix's advanced self-positioning routines inform the bearer via emphatic signals of true magnetic north. If the bearer has a data-slate handy, he can also plug it into the matrix's data-port to receive other information such as relative and absolute velocity, altitude, time of day, air pressure, and so forth. This information can be immediately useful for purposes of navigation and overland travel, but only if the bearer also has access to maps or some other kind of reference to compare the matrix's input to. Knowing which way is north can be of little utility if one doesn't know what direction he should be travelling in, never mind what's over the next rise.

When used in conjunction with a map a locator matrix grants a +20 bonus to Navigation (Surface) Tests made while travelling. Even without any other gear, the bearer of a locator matrix can always determine which direction north is.

This metallic device is permanently grafted to the back of the bearer's skull where it wires directly into the memory centers of the brain and functions as a miniaturized data vault. Aside from being able to greatly enhance the bearer's ability to remember things, an exterior pict-capture array and compact projector are attached to the bearer's temples and connected to the memorance unit by thin cables to record and capture what the bearer sees. It can then be replayed for the benefit of an audience, allowing the bearer of the implant to share his memories with others directly. This augmetic is most commonly employed by archivists and chroniclers, though scholars and other seekers of knowledge will sometimes petition for the device, whether for research or simple posterity. Much less common, though undeniably effective and with a suitable flare for the dramatic, are those who would use a memorance unit as an aid in negotiations. Potentially damaging or critical information, captured from the perspective of the augmetic's bearer, can be an excellent source of leverage in such encounters.

A memorance unit grants a +20 bonus to Trade (Remembrance) Tests as well as the Total Recall talent if the character did not already possess it. If the character already has the talent, he instead never needs to make an Intelligence Test to recollect information that the memorance unit has captured. Should the character already have cybernetic eyes or a similar bionic sense he may omit the pict-capture array and simply capture all that he sees with his augmetic oculars.

#### Mind Impulse Unit

Also known as machine-links or "Divine Conduits" among tech-priests, a mind impulse unit is a sophisticated and potent implant that allows its bearer to interface directly with the machine spirits of powerful machinery and equipment. Ultra-fine wires are ran into the bearer's brain and then coalesce into a spinal or cortical socket into which an appropriate plug from the machine is connected. A bearer who is familiar with the proper rites and rituals - and none who would carry this augmetic aren't - can communicate with and direct the machine by thought and will alone. For followers of the Cult Mechanicus, this is an act of religious importance as one becomes closer to singularity with the holy machine; those that aren't members of the priesthood would do well to show the proper respect when using a mind impulse unit whilst in the presence of tech-priests and enginseers. Being directly linked to the awesome power of large and puissant pillars of techno-artifice can be dangerous for a hasty, unobservant, or ill-prepared mind. Those who do not require the ability to direct great forge works like an orchestra or wield a Battle Titan's earth-shattering power like an extension of their own body will likely find a much humbler cerebral plug to be perfectly sufficient for their purposes. 

A mind impulse unit provides a +10 bonus to Drive, Pilot, and Tech-Use Tests made with a linked machine. More esoteric pursuits, such as communication with the machine spirits, may provide the character with other bonuses or require other Tests. Connecting a mind impulse unit requires the completion of the appropriate rituals and rites to establish communion with the machine - this takes at least one minute, though an observant tech-priest might take longer than that just out of piety. The character can attempt to speed the process up to a single Full Action, but must succeed on a **Challenging (+0) Toughness Test** or gain one level of Fatigue as the machine spirit chastises their impropriety. Especially great machines, such as void ship steering cogitators, a gun-cutter's main control systems, or a manufactorum logis stack will exact a far harsher price for those who dare intrude fleshy minds into their mechanical purity: the Toughness Test becomes **Hard (-20)** with failure inflicting 1d10 levels of Fatigue. Failure by four or more degrees instead causes the machine spirit to violently lash out at the unfortunate character, frying their mind impulse unit and their brain along with it - after a brilliant cascade of sparks, the character falls dead with his head sizzling.

##### Cerebral Plug

A much simpler type of connector compared to a full mind impulse unit, cerebral plugs are fairly common augmetics among those who work with techno-devices frequently. A significantly reduced wire network runs through the bearer's brain to a small box at the top of the spine from which a plug attached to a ribbon wire can be retrieved. By reeling out their plug, the bearer can connect himself to a variety of smaller and less complex machines, such as an auspex or vox-caster, and manipulate them without the use of manual controls. Devices that incorporate a display can also pipe their findings into the bearer's mind, allowing him to visualize the machine's read-outs rather than paging through a screen or rolls of data from an attached auto-quill. The cerebral plug is specifically devised to be unable to link with powerful machines - such a basic connector would likely cause the bearer great injury or even death as the awesome power of great machine spirits overload their mind. 

##### Mind Impulse Unit, Superior

Some types of mind impulse unit are even more substantive than most styles and patterns. Aside from the cortical or spinal socket, the bearer will also receive connector probes wired into their wrists (or fingers if they have bionic hands) to transfer both tactile as well as logical data from the machine spirits. Superior mind impulse units are rarely encountered outside the realms of the Mechanicus, and those who do bear them tend to have a strong relationship with members of the Martian Priesthood or some similar pursuit of esoteric knowledge.

A superior mind impulse unit functions as the common augmetic but also grants a +10 bonus to Logic and Inquiry Tests made with the connected machine. If the character is linked in to a war machine they gain a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made to use the machine's combat systems.

##### Mind-Weapon Interface

This less costly derivative of the mind impulse unit is designed expressly to communicate with the machine spirits of handheld weapons. A single cable connects the interface's external component, which resembles a smaller mind impulse unit's socket assembly, to a jack that is installed on the desired weapon. The bearer is then able to fire the weapon simply by focusing his mind on the action, and can also be kept abreast of other information the weapon's machine spirit may be in possession of. This could include the amount of remaining ammunition, barrel temperature, or if the weapon is in need of maintenance. In theory any kind of Imperial ballistic weapon could be made to work with a mind-weapon interface, but the most useful application of the device is in the attachment of pistol-type weapons in a servo-assisted shoulder mount, keeping the bearer's hands free to wield other implements, climb ladders, or theatrically denounce his foes with an incriminating finger. 


A mind-weapon interface can connect to most types of ranged weapons and grants the character the ability to fire the weapon without working the trigger and controls. He must still have hands free to reload or clear jams. For an extra 300 Thrones, the character can combine this augmetic with a servo-rig to attach a Pistol class weapon to one shoulder. This weapon is always considered Readied and can be fired even if the character has his hands full, is Grappling, or restrained. Note that this does not allow a character to make more than one Attack action per Round.

#### Pain Ward

A pain ward, as the name suggests, prevents the bearer from feeling physical pain. The implant takes the form of a flat, paper-thin sheet of flexible circuitry that is inserted under the skull where it literally re-wires the areas of the bearer's brain. Excruciating pain is replaced with strange perceptions of color, taste, or nothing at all as the synaptic relays are deliberately confused by the implant's circuits. While the immediate applications of such an augmetic may seem appealing to those who fight and die for a living, it is more commonly employed by debased nobles and entertainers who don't want to let an accidental injury stymie a good time. Cost isn't the only reason, however - being unable to feel pain can have conspicuously dangerous effects in and of itself, such as not being cognizant of contact with a hot surface until the bearer smells cooking flesh.

A pain ward renders a character immune to Stunning and other involuntary actions or penalties that result from painful events, such as Critical Damage, being set on fire, drowning, and so forth. The character can still be Stunned from other types of forces, such as being subjected to a Take down attack. At the GM's discretion, the character may have to begin making Awareness Tests to realize he's taken Damage, especially if it was from a more subtle source such as a silenced sniper's bullet or a poisoned stiletto.

#### Respiratory Purifier Implant
 
Compared to a full bionic respiratory system, this implant is a fairly simple solution towards making the bearer's lungs more resistant to airborne toxins and noxious fumes. A specially devised porous membrane is grown in a culture vat and then sent down the bearer's windpipe with a tiny prehensile probe where it is attached to the interior lining of the lungs. Poisonous particles and vapors have a much harder time penetrating the membrane than the organs' original surfaces and most are destroyed by natural biotic reactions. With his lungs and windpipe so augmented, the bearer can head into a toxic environment with the same confidence as if he was wearing a gas mask. However, many will still choose to carry a mask anyway owing to certain gases and poisons being able to attack the eyes as well - something this implant has no power to address. 

A respiratory purifier implant grants a +20 bonus to Toughness Tests made to withstand airborne toxins and allows a re-roll of failed Tests. This bonus does not stack with that from a gas mask or respirator as the implant essentially places the same filters in the character's lungs. If the gas can affect the character's eyes or attacks the skin, the bonus decreases to +10. This implant is not effective against any gases that can bypass a gas mask (as noted in their description).

#### Scribe-Tines

Unlike most implants, this augmetic is actually designed to improve another augmetic rather than flesh and bone. Scribe-tines are a form of extremely versatile and dexterous manipulator that is well-purposed for rifling through great stacks of paper, tapping away at a rune board, or reaching the many keys and switches on a control lectern. On command, the bearer's existing augmetic hand roughly splits in half and extends in a disturbing-looking fashion, functionally doubling the number of fingers available as well as moderately increasing their reach. The long and thin digits lack tensile and gripping strength, making them ill-suited for any kind of heavy lifting or labor. This fragility, combined with the very disquieting appearance, means that even stuffy scholars and lexmechanics who have made use of the augmetic will keep them retracted when they aren't actively in use.

This implant is technically an upgrade for a bionic arm (or hand). Scribe-tines can be deployed or retracted as a Half Action. While deployed, the implant grants a +10 bonus on all Skill Tests with the Investigation descriptor where most types of data mediums are involved; if the bearer has scribe-tines in both hands, the bonus increases to +20. However, at the sane time the character is also unable to attempt any Strength-based or Weapon Skill Tests using that hand due to the scribe-tines' delicate form.

#### Sub-dermal Armour

Agents, infiltrators, and others who rely on disguise and subterfuge often do not have the liberty of proper armor and protective gear when they most frequently change their attire and appearance. Sub-dermal armor can help rectify this by inserting thin plates of extremely high density ceramite under the bearer's tissues, protecting bones and organs from a variety of physical violence. Great care must be taken by the chirurgeon performing the task, however, as all sorts of complications can arise from shoddy workmanship, such as skin losing circulation and rotting off or muscles becoming crushed by excess pressure. Likewise, only the absolute finest "medicae-grade" ceramite can be used in the forging of the armor plates themselves - fragments chipping and breaking off, ordinarily a superficial problem on a suit of power armor, can lead to infection, tumors, or even a fatal ischemia if the bearer is unfortunate enough.

Sub-dermal armor adds 2 APs to the character's Arms, Body, and Legs locations, which stack with any worn Armour. If properly installed, the armour can't be detected by visual observation and searches, but the plates will still show up on an auspex scan.

#### Synth-Muscle

Grown in culture vats from samples of the bearer's own blood, synth-muscles are carefully implanted into the bearer's existing musculature and tendons. As one could assume, this increases the bearer's physical strength by the simple expedient of growing their overall muscle mass. Once the implants have been properly grafted and accepted by the bearer's body the new flesh functions essentially as though it was their own this includes getting flabby if the bearer becomes overly idle or indolent. Most synth-muscle grafting will noticeably increase the bearer's bulk and leave them with a more chiseled (if somewhat scarred) appearance. For those with a surplus of gelt and a deficiency in reason, a more advanced and aggressive grafting can turn them into a brutal meat mountain that is well suited to crushing lesser men with their bare hands. This requires more intensive surgical procedures as well as gene-engineering to make sure the huge bulk takes, not to mention ensuring the bearer's bones and circulatory system can handle his new muscle-bound form.

"Normal" synth-muscle grafting permanently increases the bearer's Strength Characteristic by 10, making him generally more powerful at lifting, jumping, and clobbering enemies in melee combat.

##### Synth-Muscle (Huge)

Huge grafts do the same, but also grant the bearer the Unnatural Strength (x2) trait while reducing their Agility Characteristic by 10 on account of the extreme mass of the new flesh. Additionally, the character must also eat roughly twice as much food as before in order to keep up with his artificially higher metabolic rate.

#### Vehicle Interface Circuitry

Vehicle interface circuitry is a marvelous piece of techno-artifice that is believed to be one of the few relics from the Dark Age of Technology that is still understood and practiced in the present age. Glimmering, paper-thin circuits are implanted just below the skin of the bearer's palms and fingers. The tiny web-like augmetics mesh with the controls and yokes of machines specifically devised to work in concert with them, giving the bearer a sort of intuitive understanding of the machine's operations and needs. This tech is almost invariably found only in the cockpits of flyers and small void craft - tanks and walkers tend to have much simpler controls that require a far lower level of interaction, while great machines like void ships and Titans will usually mandate the use of a mind impulse unit or similar device that allows a direct man-machine connection. Because of this association, a man bearing vehicle interface circuitry on his hands - something few would willingly cover with gloves or otherwise obfuscate - can be almost certainly fingered as a skilled pilot or void-master.

This implant grants a +10 bonus to Pilot Tests made with a vehicle that has the appropriate interface receptors. Additionally, a character so equipped can attempt a Perception Test (the Difficulty should be set by the GM depending on the situation) to determine the status and condition of the vehicle as a Free Action. This could provide information such as the remaining fuel or ammunition level, locating damaged areas, or simply gauging the readiness of the vehicle's machine spirit.

#### Vitae Supplaceor

Broadly similar to the systems and engines used in the life sustainers of great void ships plying the empyrean, a vitae suppressor is something of a personal indemnitas against all sorts of injuries and conditions that frequently result in expiration. A variety of compact implants are inserted into the bearer's torso, all of which only function if a spinal sensor detects impending death due to trauma. Arterial micro-pumps can keep blood flowing in the event of cardiac failure, electrolytic scrubber fibers stimulate the lungs to keep the body oxygenated, and reserves of pro-coagulant agents can prevent exsanguination, all with absolutely no input from the bearer. This is in and of itself a highly desirous quality, as many forms of crushing injuries often leave their victims unconscious as they expire. A vitae supplaceor can only sustain its bearer for a few hours before their wounds overwhelm the implants' life-sustaining faculties, but this is usually more than enough time - if the medicae haven't arrived by then, they probably aren't coming at all.

A character bearing a vitae supplaceor gains the Auto-sanguine talent any time he sustains Critical Damage and retains its effects until he is no longer considered Wounded. Additionally, at the GM's discretion, the character may have a 50% chance to survive what would otherwise be a fatal injury due to Critical Damage. If the vitae supplaceor saves the character in this fashion, it is able to sustain them for up to four hours, after which they expire if they haven't received adequate medical treatment to reduce their Damage to non-lethal levels.

#### Void skin

Exposure to hard void, even briefly, is almost assuredly a fatal experience, and those that do survive are often crippled from the lack of air or ridden with tumors from cosmic energies. Among veteran voidsmen, this death is quite possibly one of the most feared of the myriad ways in which a man can meet his end while plying the stern mistress of the galaxy. Void skin, a combination of physical augmetics as well as bio-chem conditioning, can offer a man a brief respite to claw his way back into a life-sustaining environment before the void claims him. A micro-fine flak-weave is integrated with the lower layers of the bearer's external tissues while chemical hardening is performed on the orifices and membranes that would burst or rupture (those who receive this treatment often find these areas to be annoyingly itchy for weeks after the initial surgeries). Furthermore, tiny chem-plant bladders are spread throughout the body - these release fast-acting protective agents that can temporarily shield the body against being irradiated or cooked by the ether's malignant power. Although undeniably useful for what it does, this implant's niche abilities as well as the fact that being "voided" is usually accompanied by other, equally fatal happenstance (such as being lit on fire by rupturing power conduits or impaled by flying shafts of reinforcement bars) makes it a particularly rare augmetic.

A character who has received the void skin implant can spend an additional 1d10+3 Rounds in the void or another hard vacuum environment before suffering its effects (see Vacuum on page 210 of _Dark Heresy_).

#### Vox plant

Visible as a small plate behind the bearer's ear, a vox plant is a short-range communicator roughly similar to a micro-bead but with the added boon of being implanted in their head. A vox plant is thus never in danger of coming loose, being accidentally forgotten somewhere, and so forth. Vox plants are most commonly encountered on the crew of void ships to ensure they don't become tangled up and lost in bundles of cabling or on the edges of maintenance passages, and they are often linked directly to the ship's vox channels for ease of use. Aside from being always accessible, a vox plant is also completely inaudible to anyone except the bearer. An internal pickup translates the movements of the bearer's mouth and throat into voice for listeners on the other end of the vox-link. This feature allows those "in the know" to produce speech simply by manipulating the muscles of their throat and tongue, making no audible noise but coming through crystal-clear on the vox plant. This technique, popularly known as "sub-vocalization", is of particular use to infiltrators, agents, and voids men saying rude things behind an officer's back.

A vox plant duplicates the effects of a Good Craftsmanship micro-bead. For twice the listed cost, it may also include the code ciphers of a Best Craftsmanship micro-bead as well.

## Blessings of the Omnissiah

Implants and bionics are often thought of as being the purview of the Adeptus Mechanicus, many of whom eagerly replace as much of their flesh and blood as possible with the shiny artifices of the Machine God. Most of these fine pieces of cyber-tech can be obtained by outsiders for the right fee or boon, thus bringing even greater riches to the Mechanicus' domains. However, there are some things which simply are not ever allowed to pass into the flesh of those not of the Martian Priesthood. These augmetics are either devised to only function with the holy implants that a tech-priest receives as part of their indoctrination in the ways of the Omnissiah, or are simply watched and guarded with such care that none ever leave the "right" hands, or bodies as the case may be.

For various reasons, these augmetics can only be used by tech-priests and other members of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Such characters need not make Inquiry Tests to locate the implant while on forge worlds and other areas that are controlled by the Mechanicus - the augmetics are always available if the tech-priest has the Thrones to pay.

#### Hermetic Infusion

With few exceptions, even the greatest of magi will still have at least a few biological components left in their bodies when their soul or machine spirit, depending on who's asked - leaves its vessel for what lies beyond. However, a tech-priest can come much closer to becoming one with the Omnissiah by draining his blood and replacing it with bio-mechanical serum. This remarkable fluid is filled with legions of homonculitic machines which course through the tech-priest's veins, repairing and rebuilding any damaged tissues they come across. The lack of biological proteins in the serum causes the tech-priest's skin - however much they have left, anyway - to become grey and wither around the edges, but this pallor is purely superficial. After undergoing a hermetic infusion, there is very little that can keep a tech-priest down without outright annihilating him entirely.

A tech-priest must already have the Auto-sanguine talent to receive this blessing. The hermetic infusion grants a +20 bonus to resist the effects of toxins, diseases, radiation, and other virulent dangers that would gravely threaten those of a more fleshy constitution. The tech-priest gains the Regeneration trait as well the serum's micro-machines can heal and repair injuries so fast that the wounded tissues can be visibly seen mending themselves. However, the tech-priest's biology becomes so radically altered by this blessing that he may no longer be treated for First Aid or receive Extended Care through the use of the Medicae skill. Further, should he ever suffer from Blood Loss, only cast spray or heavy industrial adhesives can staunch the flow of the escaping serum.

#### Mechadendrite

 After the all-encompassing red robes, the most a tech-priest are his recognizable aspect of mechadendrites. These undulating mechanical limbs are used for a wide variety of purposes and functions. Most have multiple joints or are mounted on strong servo-snakes, making them resemble metallic tentacles or pseudo-pods tipped with instruments of the Omnissiah's glory. Because they draw power directly from the tech-priest's potentia coil, they also have significant power in and of themselves, with some being able to easily heft the tech-priest up walls as though he were using his own limbs. Depending on the pattern and make, a mechadendrite may be able to conceal itself beneath a tech-priest's robes, only slithering out when its services are needed, or the limb may be a significant growth prominently jutting out of the tech-priest's back, shoulders, or sternum. The largest of the mechadendrites often include grav-stabiliser systems and gyro-guidance rigs to prevent their bearer from becoming unbalanced due to the implant's mass. All interface with a tech-priest's cyber-mantle, making them effective extensions of his own body.

A tech-priest must possess the appropriate Mechadendrite Use talent to employ the more advanced features of his mechadendrites.
 
##### Ballistic Mechadendrite

Intended primarily as a defensive augmetic, a ballistic mechadendrite mounts a sleek, powerful laspistol on the end of a flexible limb about two meters long. The weapon is thus greatly flexible and can fire in almost any direction, including while the tech-priest is otherwise engaged, such as while performing a lengthy rite or clobbering an enemy with a melee weapon. Power is siphoned off from the tech-priest's potentia coil into a permanently integrated capacitor unit, and unless the bearer is especially overzealous in its use, it will never run out of charge. An enterprising tech-priest could even shoot the weapon around corners while remaining completely hidden, though the mechadendrite does not have its own sighting system which leaves the bearer to his own machinations if he wants to avoid firing blindly. This mechadendrite is usually attached to the back or shoulder, but a few members of the Priesthood have been known to rig theirs to abruptly slide out of a sleeve of their robes.

A ballistic mechadendrite counts as a Best Craftsmanship Steel Burner heavy laspistol that is always Readied. Using his own Ballistic Skill, the tech-priest can fire the weapon as a Half Action Standard Attack or by spend Reaction for that Round, though it cannot be fired more than once in any given Round. The tech-priest is still limited to making one Attack action per Round. As long as the tech-priest's potentia coil isn't exhausted or somehow damaged, the laspistol always has a charge and never needs to be reloaded.

##### Manipulator Mechadendrite

This type of fairly simple mechadendrite is devised to grip, clamp, and manoeuvre heavy objects while keeping the tech-priest's hands free for other tasks or somatic rituals. Strong hydraulics attached to a multi-jointed appendage allow the tech-priest to direct a pair of gripping pincers up to a meter and a half away. Along with picking things up, a tech-priest can also use a manipulator mechadendrite to firmly anchor himself to the ground or any other surface, including overhead gantries or vertical trusses, and the pincers can even be used for climbing if suitable surfaces are available. Finally, the manipulator itself is made of very sturdy casehardened alloy and can be used to bludgeon stubborn relays and levers (or an assailant).

A manipulator mechadendrite grants a +20 bonus to the tech-priest's Strength Characteristic when making Tests while using it or lifting heavy objects. The manipulator can be used to make Climb Tests provided there are sufficient handholds for it to grab on to, such as exposed girders or buttresses. The mechadendrite deals 1d5+2 points of Impact Damage, plus the tech-priest's improved Strength Bonus, if used to bash in stuck doors or crush objects. The tech-priest can make Weapon Skill Tests to attack with the mechadendrite, which has the Primitive and Unbalanced qualities if used in combat.

##### Medicae Mechadendrite

Tech-priests are not well known but not for their skills as a chirurgeon, but not for lack of talent or gear. A medicae mechadendrite is fitted with all sorts of small tools useful for procedures on living or preserved flesh, such as lancets and scalpels, injectors, surgical staplers, a cauterizing probe, and so forth. The surgical implements are mounted on the end of a highly flexible limb about two meters long, and some of the more precise instruments can be further extended on tiny wire-like probes. Most tech-priests who bear this mechadendrite use it in the maintenance of servitors or biological components of large machines, but those who do have the interest and goodwill towards lesser men can be perfectly effective medicae in their own right. It is also the perfect tool for the attachment and maintenance of augmetics, and some particularly skilled magi have been known to perform their own implants utilizing this device.

A medicae mechadendrite grants a +10 bonus to any Medicae Tests made while using the limb. Among many useful tools, the mechadendrite has several specific applications. An injector unit can be loaded with up to six doses of different types of drugs which are always ready for immediate use, either on the tech-priest or others. A surgical stapler can quickly close grievous wounds, automatically ending Blood Loss as a Half Action. A small chain blade is provided to cut through personal armor to facilitate treatment to damaged biologics underneath, and can also be used to amputate a diseased or mangled limb with great speed (the difficulty becomes a Challenging (+0) Medicae Test). The tech-priest can also use the blade as a weapon by making Weapon Skill Tests, in which case it functions as a chain knife. Finally, the threatening-looking rig of gleaming instruments can be used to intimidate a helpless victim, granting a +5 bonus on Interrogation Tests if used in such a fashion.

##### Optical Mechadendrite

Unlike just about every other mechadendrite, this one has no actual tools of its own, but rather is intended to be of assistance to others or the tech-priest's own hands. The mechadendrite has two main components. First, a powerful electric torch in a shock-proof housing peers over the tech-priest's shoulder, allowing him to cast a very bright beam of light anywhere he's facing. The light can cycle through different colors, and can also be used as an infrared illuminator for IR goggles as well. Second, a pict-capture suite is installed on the tip of a very thin probe which can snake out up to three meters while being no thicker than a flow-pen. The flexible nature of the probe means it can be used to inspect machinery in cramped quarters, peer into ventilation chutes, or wiggle through vents to observe objects in toxic environments, sending still pict reports back to its bearer. Among other things, the tech-priest can remain in a dignified posture where others would be stooped over or crawling along fumbling with a handheld stab-light.

An optical mechadendrite duplicates the functions of a pair of infrared goggles and magnoculars for the tech-priest, and can also be used as a signalling device. The torch can project a high output light out to a distance of more than 100 meters, while the optical probe allows for close examination of very small objects. At the discretion of the GM, the tech-priest may receive a bonus on Search or Evaluate Tests when being able to see minute detail is relevant.

##### Plasma Cutter Mechadendrite

This type of mechadendrite is notably rarer than most due to its specialized applications. A shielded plasma cutter is installed at the end of a flexible limb about a meter and a half long and feeds photonic hydrogen from a reservoir that forms part of the mechandendrite's base. The cutter is able to slowly but steadily cut through almost any material. It is often thought of as a tool of demolition or to make doors into areas where none exist, but they can also be used for constructive purposes equally well, such as cutting lengths of conduit to the right size or shaping piston heads and impeller blades. Further, while not designed to perform as such at all, a tech-priest can also disable the cutter's safety limiters to turn the mechadendrite into an improvised plasma weapon, though such an affront to the device's machine spirits should only be undertaken in an emergency. 

A plasma cutter mechadendrite can cut through up to 20 centimeters of super hard material, such as adamantine alloy, in one minute. Less dense materials, such as ordinary metal, take proportionally less time. The cutter must be allowed to cool off for 1d5 minutes after each use. The photonic hydrogen reservoir contains enough fuel for the cutter to be used for up to 20 minutes at a time - the reservoir can be refilled using standard plasma flasks, three of which are needed to fully fill it. The tech-priest can use the mechadendrite as a weapon, in which case it is treated as a Ryza-pattern plasma pistol with an absolute maximum range of 10 meters, no Maximal setting, and the Unreliable quality. The weapon can be used similarly to a Ballistic Mechadendrite, and the tech-priest must have the appropriate talent to make use of it as such. Firing the weapon in this fashion consumes fuel equivalent to 2 minutes' worth of cutting time.

##### Utility Mechadendrite

Fitted with all sorts of useful tools and appendages, a utility mechadendrite is about the closest thing to "common" as far as the artificial Mechanicus limbs can be concerned, and is often the first type of mechadendrite that a tech-priest will graft to his body. A utility mechadendrite is a highly flexible limb about two meters long bristling with a variety of implements to assist the tech-priest in the commission of his holy duties to the Machine God. In general, such a mechadendrite will be armed with numerous drivers, sockets and spanners, blades, snipers, a sparker, lubricant and oil dispensers, a current monitor, and probably a few other bits as well. The mechadendrite also includes a built in censer for puffing incense as part of rituals and rites as well as to sooth perturbed machine spirits with a direct blast. Giving the wide range of styles and fixtures, a utility mechadendrite may have other features and faculties as well, such as thermal probes to determine the temperature of fluids or surfaces, mag-clamps to hold small objects steady for closer inspection, and so forth.

A utility mechadendrite's various tools and implements duplicate the effects of a combi-tool while keeping the tech-priest's hands free for other tasks. If the tech-priest has the Ferric Lure or Ferric Summons talents, he can attract objects to a utility mechadendrite instead of his hands. The censer can be used offensively to distract and obscure by puffing fumes into the faces of enemies. As a Half Action, the tech-priest can create a puff of incense smoke with a two meter radius. Living creatures whose eyes and nose aren't protected incur a -5 penalty on Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Perception-based Tests while in the cloud, which dissipates in 1d5+1 Rounds (or faster if a strong breeze presents itself). The censer takes one minute to build up enough fumes to be used in this fashion again. Because of the very pungent and recognizable scent of Mechanicus incense, any Perception based Tests to detect the tech-priest that rely on scent gain a +10 bonus. The censer can be shut off as a Full Action which ceases making the smells, though it takes 1d10 minutes to coax it back into action again if the tech-priest requires its services. The blades and cutters on the mechadendrite can be used as a weapon in a pinch, functioning as a mono-edged knife with the Defensive quality. The tech-priest can make Half Action Standard Attacks using his Weapon Skill as normal.

#### Secutor Augmetics

The Secutors of the Auxilia Myrmidon are fearsome experts at strategic warfare as well as personal combat, applying their knowledge of machinery and extensive augmetics to make themselves an embodiment of the Imperium's mighty war machine. Those who truly relish battle will often undergo a lengthy series of implants and rituals that reshape their fleshy bodies and what bionics they already have to be more powerful and durable, further solidifying their roles as warrior-priests who are only fulfilled while preparing mighty death-dealing machines or crushing their enemies with bionic siege weapons. Aside from becoming noticeably stronger and more solidly built, a Secutor's brain is also wired to make sure it has no shortage of the one emotion that such combatants truly need: aggression.

Secutor augmetics improve the tech-priest's Strength and Toughness Characteristics by 10, but also reduce his Agility Characteristic by the same on account of the more solid and heavy construction. The tech-priest's weight doubles and he gains the Iron Jaw and True Grit talents if he did not have them already. Further, if the tech-priest has the Machinator Array talent, he can opt to replace one or both bionic arms with a heavy ranged weapon or breacher, leaving his mechadendrites to assist with things he would have used hands on before. A Sector always desires to be in battle or preparing for it, and this monomania focused on combat inflicts 1d10 Insanity Points as the tech-priest begins to think of himself as a weapon more than anything else. 

#### Servo-Arm

This huge appendage is too large to be considered a proper mechadendrite, although it is used in a similar fashion. Servo-arms are typically only seen in the employ of Enginseers and other tech-priests who frequently work around very large and heavy objects, such as those attached to Imperial Guard regiments or foremen in macro-foundries. A servo-arm more resembles a transplanted gantry armature than a mechadendrite, having only a few points of articulation and fitted with a huge clamp or pincer almost the size of a man's chest. The entire rig is fitted with grav-stabilisers so that the tech-priest doesn't tip over while lifting giant machine blocks or tipping a Leman Russ onto its side to replace damaged tracks. The limb is invariably attached to the tech-priest's cyber mantle directly at his center of mass, remaining folded up in a more compact shape akin to a backpack when not in use. Although intended strictly as a heavy-duty utility device, a servoarm's monstrous hydraulics and pistons can be used to utterly flatten lesser men like tiny hive roaches, and a good slam could potentially flip over light ground vehicles.

The tech-priest must have the Mechadendrite Use (Manipulator) to use a servo-arm. The servo-arm uses its own Strength of 65 with the Unnatural Strength (x2) trait in place of the tech-priest's own as far as determining how much weight it can lift or push. The bulky pincers or clamps at the end of the mechadendrite can be used to pick up durable objects or to securely anchor the tech-priest to an available surface, but the servo-arm has very little precision and can't be used for any tasks requiring manual dexterity. If used as a weapon, the servo-arm imposes a -10 penalty to the tech-priest's Weapon Skill Test made to attack with it due to its bulk and poor handling. A direct hit from the servo-arm inflicts 2d10+12 Impact Damage with a Penetration value of 2 (do not add the tech-priest's own Strength Bonus to the total Damage); the servo-arm is considered to have the Unwieldy quality.
