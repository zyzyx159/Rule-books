*"It's simple really. If we place the signifier here in this position, the rest of the cipher solves itself."*

— Scholar Gabel Troken, Librarium Centris, Scintilla.

Adepts are wise and learned scholars, or at least they hope to be one day. As members of the educated class they are skilled with languages, knowledge, and often act as the brains of any group. As a social class that focuses on practical skills and the acquisition of knowledge they typically make for mediocre fighters, and depending on the Adept’s particular specialties may not have much in the way of “people skills” either. When it comes to the realm of the mind however, they leave everyone else for dust.

## **Archivist Advances**

*"Throne blind you boy, fetch those books before I use your hide for a binding!"*

Archivists keep manuscripts and tend the needs of Sages, scurrying between tottering bookshelves and datacrypts, ever with an eye to escaping their servitude.

## **Scrivener Advances**

*"Dharkins, your illuminations are positively Rabeliean. You'll do well; just not here."*

Scriveners have wormed their way into a position of trust, whence they may actually deal with scrolls, books and data-slates directly. Of course, they are the primary oppressors of Archivists, as is only right and proper.

## **Scribe Advances**

*"A scribe is always useful. Knowledge can make the difference between life and death, particularly if you send the scribe in first…"*

Scribes are vessels of knowledge, skilled in the byzantine art of extracting information from all manner of sources. Many secretly fear they will never rise further within the ranks of the Administratum, hence they are naturally keen to take risks to get ahead.

## **Inditor Advances**

*"If you've a mind to dig to the bottom of something, an inditor is invaluable. If they don't know it, they can find it out for you. If they can't find it… well, you're probably not meant to know it anyway."*

Inditors are trusted members of the Administratum, having been initiated into some of its deeper secrets. Even the lore of other Adepta is not beyond their scrutinising gaze.

## **Chirurgeon Advances**

*"Them chirurgeons issa odd bunch. Watch it if they offers ta cut ya fer free. Iss the way they looks at yer as they're rummagin' in yer guts. Kinda like yera cross 'tween an essperiment anna pork lunch."*

Chirurgeons investigate the secrets of the human form, studying the cryptic chambers of the heart, the enigmas of flesh and bone, and, of course, the moist grey mysteries of the brain.

*"Scholar Dharkins passes bow your head! He cured the Seeping Cough and the Dread-Pox. Whisper has it he advises the hive council. 'Twernt for him, Throne knows where we'd be!"*

A Scholar is in full bloom of his powers, wise, learned and skilled in getting results from the almighty machine that is the Administratum. Should they avoid peevish theoretical debate and infighting, Scholars become respected and mighty indeed.

##### **The Question of Psychic Adepts**
Through certain Advances a Loremaster Adept may become a psyker in the middle of a campaign. These Advances are intended to represent these characters gaining psychic ability through studying occult mysteries and forbidden lore. It does, however, raise the question of whether these psychic adepts are sanctioned and where their power comes from. Three options for handling this vexing matter are presented here:

* **Sorcery:** The psychic powers open to Loremasters and Magisters are in fact knowledge of sorcery gained through forbidden research. Swap the Loremaster’s Psy-Rating 1 Advance for Sorcery and add in Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Int) and Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Int) +10 as two advances for 100 points each. In the Magister rank, remove the Minor Psychic Power and Psy Rating 2 Advances and swap the Psy Rating 3 Advance for Master Sorcerer.
* **Sanctionite:** When the Adept takes the Loremaster Psy Rating 1 Advance, they are trained and sanctioned as a psyker using the formal process of the Scholastica Psykana. It can be assumed that Inquisitorial influence “expedites” this process quite a bit, but the character will likely need to be removed from play for about a year or so to accommodate this exhaustive ordeal. The character returns to play with the Sanctioned Psyker Trait from the Imperial Psyker Career.
* **Rogue Psyker:** Instead of gaining Psy Rating 1, an Adept who passes through the Loremaster Rank may instead receive the Nascent Psyker Elite Advance Package. If the psychic power involved is suitably ‘discreet,’ the character may not even be aware that he possesses it, (although of course the player does!), and wields it subconsciously, simply believing it to be a ‘knack’ or good fortune, at least at the beginning…
## **Comptroller Advances**

*"Stop staring, lad. It's not for the likes of archivists like you to look upon Comptrollers. Of course, he has an extra brain. You would too, if you had to work like that."*

Comptrollers direct the ebb and flow of information that passes through the Administratum, plucking seemingly unconnected facts from the sea of knowledge to construct masterful solutions and cunning plans of attack.
