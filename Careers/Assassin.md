*"When I kill, it is beautiful—an art form older than any painting or sculpture."*

— Lyra Trix, Malfian Noble House Assassin.

Assassins are skilled killers, adept at getting close to a target and ending their days. Some are violent and bloodthirsty savages that revel in leaving a trail of gore and broken bodies in their wake, while others are cold-blooded consummate professionals who view murder as just another business transaction. Whether with blade or gun, or for bloodlust or profit, Assassins are some of the most dangerous men and women of the Inquisition, each one a finely honed tool of man-slaying.

# **Assassin Advances**

*"I think Lord Varcus needs to be reminded of his place; perhaps it is time he was introduced to our mutual friend."*

Assassination is a constant throughout the Imperium and an accepted political tool on countless worlds. The absolute rule of many planetary governors is often enforced at the tip of an assassin's blade.

# **Death Adept Advances**

*"Your screams are as music, and your blood is as wine to me."*

The Death Adept pursues killing as an art form, training themselves into a perfection of martial grace and death. Many Death Adepts no longer kill for money or on the whim of their masters, but rather to indulge in the purity of death itself.

# **Freeblade Advances**

*"I thought it was Ferstin coming to relieve us, at least until he shot Jyanus in the face. Turned out Ferstin had been dead for days."*

A Freeblade is an infiltrator, skilled in disguise and deception. His tactics include confusing his enemies and leaving them jumping at shadows while he closes in for the kill.
