*"He demands? The demands of the law come first, even in Hive Tarsus."*

— Regulator Hanz Rikennan, IVth Precinct, Hive Tarsus.

Arbitrators are tough law-keepers and judges. They ensure that the Imperium’s laws are maintained, whilst also acting as executioners for rebels, seditionists and trouble-makers. Arbitrators do not serve on any local planetary police force, rather they are members of a higher organisation: the Adeptus Arbites. Arbitrators are good in a fight, and while their combat prowess is somewhat below that of a Guardsman’s, they also possess a “sufficient” range of social graces to investigate and track down their targets. Any group could also benefit from an Arbitrator’s dogged toughness, broad range of useful skills, and knowledge of Imperial law.
