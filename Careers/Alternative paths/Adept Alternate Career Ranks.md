## **Agent of the Lords Dragon**

*“The phrase 'be seeing you' has a different meaning for us, Inquisitor Caidin. When we say this, it is to be taken quite literally.”*

– Arch-Magos Karolinious Benz, Magos-Draco of the Lords Dragon
### **Background**
Shrouded in mystery, and whispered about only by fools and madmen, is the legend of the Panopticon. Supposedly hidden deep within the Lathes System, this orbiting void station is rumoured to be the real authority behind the Calixian Mechanicus, and the seat of power for an organisation whose name is synonymous with dread: the Lords Dragon.

Dispatched to the then-unconquered Calix Expanse thousands of years ago through Logis-Prophesies, secretive Tech-Priests sought out worlds to eventually bring under Mechanicus control. They were to locate any sites that would be advantageous once the upcoming Angevin Crusade had finished, and to ensure that the Mechanicus claimed the most important worlds as their own, before the Adeptus Ministorum gained a foothold in the new Sector. The first agents to arrive quickly discovered a small system colonised aeons ago during Mankind’s earliest steps into the galaxy. The irregular orbits of its main worlds created violent shifts of gravity, and had resulted in the formation of three unusual asteroid belts. Only the bravest or most foolish of ship captains could ever hope to safely navigate the gravitic nightmare of the system’s asteroids, and thus the Lords Dragon, the ancient cabal of Arch-Magi tasked with policing the Mechanicus within the Sector, took the hidden centre of these belts as their new home.

The Panopticon Orbital was built as a habitat and headquarters for the Lords Dragon, but more importantly as a hub of observation. The Lords Dragon knew that they would need to observe the emerging Calixis Sector to ensure that tech-heresy and affronts to the Machine God never went unpunished. Using scarcely understood devices from the Dark Age of Technology, the Lords Dragon established an extensive monitoring network known as the Praecursator Grid across the Pondus system, using the space around their new home as a field test. If their system allowed observation without direct interference, then they knew that they could expand the grid to cover all the forge worlds that would eventually be built, and even some worlds outside the Mechanicus’ sphere of authority.

They soon discovered that the surviving descendants of the original colonists had actually thrived in their cruel environment, and performed genetic modifications to improve their usefulness even further. Lest others such as the Ecclesiarchy claim them, the population was interred into massive Great Holds and kept in stasis in the fringes of the cometary clouds surrounding the system. When the Crusade arrived in the system many years later, it would find a group of harsh, uninhabited worlds suitable only for the Adeptus Mechanicus, and once established, the Lords Dragon could bring the population back, each one of them ready and eager to work for the glory of the Omnissiah. Such is the scope of the Lords Dragon and their guidance for the greater good of the Machine Cult.

With the success of their observation technology, the Lords Dragon began to involve themselves directly in the Angevin Crusade. They went back to their usual methods of seeking out corruption from within, ensuring that the worlds the crusade conquered were purged of tech-heresy. They took steps to ensure that the Explorator fleets found their way to what would become the Lathes System, and then did what they could to engineer the ceding of the worlds to the Mechanicum. As each new forge world was lit, the Lords Dragon monitored. Within each new voidship hull laid or Skitarii regiment raised, their surveillance kept close watch for any signs of deviant thought or deed. Hardly a moment went by when the Lords Dragon were unable to view exactly what the Mechanicus was doing within the gestating Calixis Sector, or, at least, that is what they would wish all who dwell in the Lathe Worlds to believe.

The Lords Dragon have always made the Inquisition wary. From the Inquisition’s perspective, only it has the proper remit and power to safeguard humanity against the terrors within, without, and beyond, and it does not relish the idea of others, operating outside of its purview, attempting to do the same. The Tricorn Palace has spent many fruitless years petitioning the Lathes for access to the Panopticon Orbital, but every request has been denied. To make matters worse, the Inquisition is seemingly unable to even prove its existence, though many suppose this is more than likely a ploy of intrigue for the purposes of future negotiations—if there's one thing the Inquisition excels at above all else, it is finding things.

More disturbing are the continued reports that the Praecursator Grid extends beyond the borders of the Cult Mechanicus, and that the Lords Dragon have the ability to spy upon many important Ecclesiarchical holdings, the domain of Sector Lord Hax, and the Tricorn Palace itself. Some even believe that all the cybernetics manufactured within the Calixis Sector are part of this Grid, and that everyone who has ever received a bionic is actually an unwitting spy in service to the Lords Dragon. If such a revelation were found to be true then the outrage, especially from the Ecclesiarchy and groups such as the Cult of the Pure Form, would be immense, and the Calixis
Sector could find itself in a sectarian conflict the likes of which it has never seen. The Inquisition has mounted numerous operations to infiltrate the Lords Dragon but has not met with any reported success, their agents usually returning empty-handed—often with a letter of reproachment from the Lords Dragon in hand—or, sometimes, simply not returning at all.

Yet for all their clandestine work and surprisingly adroit political manoeuvring, the Lords Dragon are more than willing to work alongside the Inquisition when the situation calls for it. Unlike most within the Calixian Mechanicus, the Lords Dragon are not especially secretive when it comes to cooperation with other organisations, as long as they can stay behind the scenes. This has given the Lords Dragon a fearful reputation amongst the Lathe populations, and they are all too eager and willing to foster this dread. They actively encourage the servants of the Mechanicus to believe the stories—that they are always watching, that they can operate in plain sight without anyone knowing, and that the fabled Dragon Secutorii are waiting for the moment when they will swoop down and destroy everyone who has ever cursed at a machine. This could be a ruse to disguise possible gaps in their observational systems or limitations of their power, creating the impression that the Lords Dragon are more omniscient than they truly are. Some even whisper that the dreaded Praecursator Grid itself does not exist at all, and never has either—the seemingly pervasive eyes and ears of the Lords Dragon, then, are actually just the result of diligent "old-fashioned" agent work. Few are willing to determine if these rumours might be correct, and only those dwelling within the Panopticon Orbital know the real truth.

To be such an agent is to act in the name of the Omnissiah and to always watch for tech-heresy in any form, no matter the source. Such deviance within the Sector often comes from the highest Magos as well as the least disciplined novice Tech-Adept, as well as from unsanctified xenos abominations that would pollute the Machine Spirit. Their extensive surveillance technologies across the Lathe Worlds are not absolute, and only through extensive travel and investigation can they properly act to ensure the preservation of the Mechanicum. Agents may have differing standards as to what constitutes tech-heresy, however, despite what appear to be rigid definitions. The cabal is remarkably united in its goals, though, for the Cult of the Machine God’s survival is of paramount importance. Only through the proper worship of the Omnissiah and his blessed technologies can humanity continue, let alone achieve the perfection of the Holy Machine. All who serve the Dragon in the Lathes know that Mankind is but one blasphemous experiment or unholy xenotech activation away from falling once again into darkness, and it is their duty to prevent this, damn the protestations of the Sector's other authorities.
### **Becoming an Agent of the Lords Dragon**
Very much like the Holy Ordos of the Inquisition, the Lords Dragon are quite cautious when it comes to whom they select as their representatives. Each carefully chosen Agent must be trustworthy and incorruptible, and they must take the secrets of the Lords Dragon to their graves. To join the Lords Dragon is to gain knowledge of one of the greatest secrets in the Calixis Sector, the Praecursator Grid, and although most Agents never see the Panopticon Orbital, all are aware of its unique ability to use this Grid to observe and gather data from every forge world across the Calixis Sector. Perhaps surprisingly, Agents of the Lord Dragon are loaned to Inquisitors on a regular basis, although the more cynical voices within the Inquisition see this apparent high level of assistance as just another example of the Lords Dragon’s desire to infiltrate all aspects of the Sector's authorities and governing bodies.

Upon becoming an Agent of the Lords Dragon, the character gains the **Rigor Mentis Trait**.

**Required Career:** Adept, Arbitrator, Assassin, or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Mechanicum Thrall:** Even Agents who are not ordained Tech-Priests benefit from the considerable resources the Lords Dragon have at their disposal. The character is considered Mechanicus Class for the purposes of determining monthly income.
**Other Requirements:** Cannot have Peer (Ecclesiarchy) or Good Reputation (Ecclesiarchy)
#### **Trait: Rigor Mentis**
The Lords Dragon might enjoy the level of dread that they inspire within the Lathe Worlds, but even they would not risk their greatest secrets for something as trivial as a reputation. Those who find themselves selected to join the Lords Dragon’s ranks undergo significant hypnoath conditioning that makes them resistant to interrogation, specifically interrogation related to the Lords Dragon themselves or anything to do with the Panopticon Orbital. It is an unconscious form of mental defence, and even if the Agent were aware of it, he would be unable to crack it intentionally.

The Acolyte may re-roll any Interaction Test made to resist the effects of Interrogation, Charm, Deceive, or any other method that an adversary might use to gain information relating to the Lords Dragon, the Panopticon Orbital, or anything related to the Praecursator Grid.

#### **Talent: All-Seeing Eye**
At some point during his service to the Lords Dragon, an Agent will be instructed in how to gain limited access to the Praecursator Grid. To access to the Praecursator Grid, the Acolyte should make a **Hard (–20) Tech-Use Test**. If he succeeds, the Acolyte gains the most recently recorded information, usually no more than a day old. If the Acolyte gains 3 or more degrees of success, he gains complete access to the Grid on that planet, and may look through any pict feed and access any archived data. Access to the Praecursator Grid must be gained personally, and the GM has final determination on whether the Acolyte can access the Grid, as well as whether the Grid is functioning within the requested area.
#### **Talent: Metal Fatigue**
**Requirements:** Interrogation Skill
Tech-heresy is a grave matter, and one that the Mechanicus does not take lightly. Hereteks and others who would misuse the Omnissiah’s gifts are the greatest enemies of the Lords Dragon, and they have developed many ways to drive information from those they capture. One of the more insidious interrogation methods is that of Metal Fatigue, where a small bionic implant is used to slowly disintegrate the subject’s cybernetic components. This causes an excruciating pain that very few can resist, and those who do often die in agony, bereft of their bionics. The Acolyte can use Metal Fatigue by making an Opposed Tech-Use Test against the subject’s Toughness. For every Degree of Success the Acolyte gains, the subject takes 1 Damage and suffers a –10 penalty to the Interrogation Test that follows. If the subject takes Damage equal to his Toughness Bonus, he permanently loses one randomly chosen cybernetic. The subject of the interrogation must have at least one cybernetic implant for the Acolyte to use this Talent.
## **Agent of Reliquary 26**

*“Ours is not an easy task. We gather those most important relics, those symbols of the culture of Mankind. We dare the darkness and travel across the stars clinging to rumour and legend as our guide.”*

– Marcius Dans, Agent of Reliquary 26
### **Background**
Entombed more than a hundred metres beneath the Inquisition's majestic if imposing Tricorn Palace is the Grand Reliquarium, a series of vaults that are home to many artefacts and powerful relics of the Calixis Sector. In these hallowed halls rest hundreds of items of power, from crafted trinkets of the Dark Age of Technology to the blessed weapons of venerable martyrs or even saints. Each of these vaults, of which reliable sources claim there at at least one hundred, are heavily guarded, monitored, and tended to by the Custodiatrix, a small organisation of curator-assassins, each charged with the safety of the artefacts and assigned to one of the vaults. Reliquary 26 contains the relics of the Scholariate at Arms.

In addition to housing artefacts, Reliquary 26 also employs a great number of Agents, men and women who scour the Calixian worlds in search of more items of renown to add to the vaunted collection. Whether through negotiation, deception, or violence, the goal of these Agents is a simple one: ensure the safety and survival of the relics of Man. To do so, they must first identify such items of power, decide whether or not the current ownership is valid, and reclaim the item in question, by force if necessary. Often, Agents act alone or in pairs, though it is not uncommon for an entire cadre of mercenaries to be hired if an acquisition proves particularly difficult. It is rumoured that that the Scholariate at Arms once hired an entire house of assassins to reclaim a relic from the blessed armour of Saint Drusus, though the veracity of such a rumour could never be proven.

As one might expect, Agents of Reliquary 26 are very well outfitted. Although they are relatively unknown as an organisation, members often find themselves at odds with Calixian nobles, Ecclesastical prelates, Rogue Traders, and mercantile magnates—individuals who often value their possessions and do not wish to part with them simply because the Inquisition asks nicely. As a result, many Agents have at least one or two enemies in the upper echelons of Imperial society. Though the agency does attempt to reimburse the owners of the relics they acquire, it is not uncommon for them to have to pry the artefact in question from the lifeless fingers of some greedy soul that simply couldn't part with it for any amount of compensation.

Reliquary 26 works quite closely with the larger Ordos of the Inquisition. Often, Inquisitors find themselves with items of interest left over from an investigation. In exchange for the safe return of any relics or artefacts found by an Inquisitor in the course of his duties, Reliquary 26 will often return the favour by loaning out an item of great power. Many Inquisitors are quite content to employ Agents of Reliquary 26 in their Acolyte cells, profiting from the Agents' access to rare and often powerful devices while maintaining a mutually-beneficial relationship with the Custodiatrix. 
### **Becoming an Agent of Reliquary 26**
An experienced servant of Reliquary 26 is an indispensable resource to an Acolyte cell. When dealing with nobility or other well-to-do types, or in areas where ancient or xenos technology may
be encountered, an Inquisitor would be well served by requisitioning an Agent of Reliquary 26's services. Such Agents usually only serve the Inquisitor the duration of the investigation at hand. Inquisitors who must regularly navigate such treacherous situations have been known to second a trusted Acolyte to the Custodiatrix to be trained in their ways, effectively gaining a permanent "representative" to Reliquary 26's hallowed armoury. As the point of contact between the Grand Reliquarium and the often covetous owners of the sought-after artefacts, most Agents become quite adept at negotiation and tradecraft. Such skills can be invaluable to an Acolyte cell, especially in situations where a hostile acquisition could be more troublesome than normal.

**Required Career:** Any Career
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Must have acquired one item of Near Unique Availability or rarer, and turned it over to his Inquisitor or directly to the Grand Reliquarium.
**Aggrieved Parties:** Even if the character has not personally wronged them, at least one group of well-heeled individuals gravely dislikes Reliquary 26. The character gains the [Rival (Ecclesiarchy), (Nobility), or (Rogue Trader)](talents.md#rival) Talent at the GM's discretion.
**Reliquary Loan:** The Grand Reliquarium has resources that include ancient and exotic equipment that is sometimes entrusted to Acolytes serving an Inquisitor. At the beginning of each mission the character gains one valuable item determined by the GM. Unless the character receives some special dispensation, the item must be returned after the mission, with grave consequences for those who try to deprive the Reliquarium of their property. The GM should choose an item that they feel is appropriate to the Acolyte's mission.

## **Bonded Emissary**

*"My masters regret that your harvest has failed, governor, and unrest stirs your little world. Perhaps you should seek assistance from the free captains as you did three years ago when you turned down our last generous offer, and with it the protection of our friendship… no? Well, unfortunately things have grown harsher in the sub-sector of late and our price now is regrettably somewhat higher…"*

— Adept-Assayer Alisha Zhou, Emissary of the Machenko Dynasty.
### **Background**
Travel is a hazardous business, and foolish is the man or woman who steps unwary of the dangers away from the safety of their own, let alone seeks to travel the cold and merciless darkness between the stars. Such travel in some ways is an even more dangerous business for the powerful and wealthy of the Calixis Sector's elites, because, although insulated by their power and their followers from commonplace hardships, they often have many enemies and much to lose. The Imperium of Man is a grim and deadly place; the great and the powerful must always fear the assassin's hand, as well as the intrigues, plots and machinations of their rivals. It is unsurprising that many choose to remain at the centre of their domains and, when matters of import arise that do not require their personal presence, they send others out in their stead. The Bonded Emissary is just such a person. Emissaries are, by their nature, powerful individuals, no mere messenger, trade factor or errand-runner. An Emissary speaks with their master's voice and carries with them a measure of their master's authority. Such a trusted and delicate position requires much from the individual involved, as they must be above all, clever, socially adept, and strong-willed. They must also have a mastery of the facts at hand and be aware of the subtle interplay of politics, while being wary always for the manoeuvring and plotting of their master's rivals. Some Emissaries focus on the skills of the diplomat and the negotiator, while others act mainly as agents to evaluate and acquire objects, opportunities, and even people who their masters might wish to recruit. Successful Emissaries soon become recognised and valued, and win favour and power in their own right. The work of an Emissary is a high risk one, however, and those that fail their employers abjectly or cause them to lose face seldom get a second chance.

In the Calixis Sector, as in much of the Imperium, Emissaries go by numerous names and titles depending on their task and their master. The Administratum has a labyrinthine series of titles and designations, from the Quastor Maximus who sits in attendance at the Lucid Palace, to the grey ranks of reeves, delagators, potentates and the innumerable sub-consuls, consuls lesser and peripatetic that shuttle between its concerns and the other branches of the Adeptus Terra and the Commercia Houses. The great trade guilds and trans-stellar cartels, such as the Skaelen-Har Hegemony and the DeVayne Corporation, have their brokers, agents and procurators to represent them. The noble houses of Scintilla, Malfi and the other major worlds have their own heralds and nuncios, and up-and-coming scions that provide them with ambassadors and who maintain their presence at court. The various powers and domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus also largely depend on Emissaries chosen from the ranks of their tech-priests to interact with the wider Imperium, whose "petty" concerns and intrigues as they see them hold little interest for the Magos. The tech-priests themselves are largely the source of some not-unjustified fear, misunderstanding, and apprehension by others, and in order to overcome this difficulty and secure their desired outcomes, the ordered minds of the Mechanicus are liable to engage a more fleshy specialist to act for them.
### **Becoming a Bonded Emissary**
By the nature of their work an Inquisitor has need of trained killers, mind-bending psykers, and dogged investigators. Most, however, often require the more subtle services of liars and dissemblers, individuals whose perception allows them to read the susurrous ebb and flow of the interplay of a noble's court, and men and women who can detect the telltale taint of madness beneath a genial façade. Emissaries are perfect for such tasks, and an Acolyte with these skills can be confidently relied upon to act as the cornerstone of any covert investigation, often with the backing of false identities and cover provided by the Holy Ordos. Those that meet them, while in one of their cover identities, rarely guess their true master unless they decide to reveal it.

**Required Career:** Adept or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp) 
**Other Requirements:** Intelligence 30 and Fellowship 30

## **Cult of the Pure Form**

*"The flesh is strong!"*

— Pure Form maxim
## **Background**
Given the intense liturgical "differences" between them, the Ecclesiarchy and the Adeptus Mechanicus have never enjoyed a healthy working relationship within the Calixis Sector. Conflicts between the two organisations tend to be wars of words, though, political battles fought in the capital worlds of the Sector, rather than outright "shooting wars" between men and machines. Nevertheless, there have been several overt conflicts, such as the attack on the Explorator vessel *Omega Inquiry* from an Adepta Sororitas strike force on the far edges of the Halo Stars. There are no official records of the encounter, but the Tricorn contains sealed datavaults hinting at a heretofore undiscovered abhuman strain that the Mechanicus had uncovered far from civilised space, and the Ministorum’s reactions of horror when their spies reported the discovery. Greatly displeasured by the loss of the Explorator coterie, a Mechanicus Secutor cohort laid waste to two outpost convents in retaliation, and was about to escalate further before secretive diplomacy and unnamed offerings negotiated by third parties settled the matter. Such incidents are still rare, but with the gradual rise of a group calling itself the Cult of the Pure Form, this could begin to change.

It is not known exactly who founded the Cult of the Pure Form, but their influence began in the Malfian Sub-Sector in the immediate aftermath of the Malygrisian Heresy. The traitorous Tech- Priest and his followers ravaged numerous worlds with their devastating weaponry, and some began to think that the existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus would lead to another, inevitable war. The followers of this emerging cult feared that this coming doom would scour humankind from the galaxy, leaving only the cold, barely-human flesh and machine hybrids of the Mechanicus domains behind. This twisted line of logic grew quickly until the first major anti-Mechanicum movement of the Calixis Sector’s history began to swell, with loud marches and violent demonstrations.

In an unexpected move, and one that likely came about due to Cult Mechanicus political manoeuvring on Scintilla, the Sector Synod declared the emergent cult apostate. Over the next decades the cult leaders began to disappear, some dying in mysterious accidents while others perished in what were clearly outright assassinations. Some thought that the Inquisition was to blame, and others whispered of the Officio Assassinorum’s involvement, but very few were aware that the secretive Lords Dragon of the Mechancius bore sole responsibility for this early intervention, and that their clandestine methods had managed to stifle the movement before it
could truly become established. For its part, the Calixian Inquisition viewed this suppression as a grievous overstep of the Lords Dragon's authority beyond the realm of the Lathes, and it was made abundantly clear to the Magi that another transgression of that scale would engulf them in a true shadow war they were not liable to win.

After more high-level negotiation, the Lords Dragon agreed to cease their campaign of suppression, handing over all information they had gathered on the new sect for the Inquisition to process as it saw fit. While the watchers of the Panopticon hoped that the Inquisition would continue their work in stamping out the Cult of the Pure Form, the Conclave determined it was largely harmless to the broader Imperium, and contented themselves to merely monitoring its activities for emergent signs of heresy.

With the bionic boot of the Lords Dragon permanently removed from its figurative throat, the Cult of the Pure Form rose once again, finding succour and eager supporters anywhere common men took umbrage to the Mechanicus' abuses or superstitious fear of its unknowable rites. This time, however, a new generation of cult leaders threw out its previous methods in favour of a slower approach, and rather than attempting to whip the people of a single sub-sector into a frenzy, they would instead choose to let their hatred for the Mechanicus gradually simmer on worlds across the entire Sector.

A second blow came in the form of Ignato Borja, the new Arch-Cardinal of the Sector Synod. Under Ignato's stewardship the Ecclesiarchy curiously refrained denouncing the reformed Cult of the Pure Form. Indeed, Mechanicus spies close to the Ministorum's prelates reported that, at least unofficially, the Ecclesiarchy was quite content to allow the reach of the Pure Form cultists to grow, seeing any harm it might cause the Mechanicus as a potential gain for themselves. Even the Inquisition would be of no aid—initially suspicious of the Pure Form's return to prominence, many of the more puritanical Inquisitors who looked into the cult's ways began to see them in a positive light, emulating agreeable philosophies about the sanctity of the human body and acting as valuable check against the Mechanicus' own clandestine efforts.

Their mechadendrites tied, the Lords Dragon have been forced to passively observe as the Cult of Pure Form rose to prominence once more. Like clockwork, any egregious display of the Mechanicus' power beyond its forge worlds—an Explorator press-gang crew riving through starport public houses, or servitor-artisans systemically scooping up dregs in a hab-vault—is likely to be followed up by an agitator from the Pure Form arriving to preach about the sin and hubris of the Martian Priesthood.

As a matter of liturgy, the Cult of the Pure Form’s members—most of them, anyway—do not hate the Adeptus Mechanicus purely for their worship of the Omnissiah, and neither are they explicitly anti-technology. They simply wish to wrest control of such power away from the Mechanicus, proffering the provincial view that “uncorrupted” humans might control it instead. Their true ire stems from the extensive use of cybernetics and other mechanical implants that virtually every member of the Adeptus Mechanicus possesses. To the cult, the most pure form in the universe is that of the human body, an image of the God-Emperor Himself, and to defile it by removing untainted flesh and grafting on artificial limbs and organs is blasphemy in its own right.

Quite a few members of the Cult of the Pure Form have cybernetic implants when they join. These souls are often spurred on by dissatisfaction with low quality or cheap implants, or suffer a form of "cyberpsychosis" where they cannot perceive their augments as part of their own body and come to loathe their presence. These cultists undergo a ritual known as the Purity of Flesh to remove the implants from their bodies. 

This ritual often leaves the participant missing limbs or eyes, and can rob them of their ability to hear or even speak. Known as the “Shriven” by other Pure Form cultists, these blessed men and women are highly regarded, having seen the purity of the human body as it was meant to be and unshackling themselves from the augmetic prisons of the Mechanicus. Most will choose to replace their removed cybernetics with strictly fleshy equivalents, often vat-grown examples cultivated for the individual Shriven in question, although some are forced to make do with biomatter reclaimed and purified from servitors or harvested from executed criminals. Especially pious cultists have been known to reject even this, however, getting by with purely inert prostheses and simply accepting the loss of ability that comes from a missing body part as an intractable and, indeed, necessary aspect of the human condition.

The bulk of the cult’s ranks, however, are made up of those fortunate enough to have lived without the defilement of cybernetics, and are referred to as the “Untouched.” Each Untouched member comes to the sect for different reasons, but most are spurred on by a love of the God-Emperor as a human paragon and an inherent mistrust of, or an outright animus towards, the Adeptus Mechanicus.

The Cult of the Pure Form does not sit by and wait passively for people to see its point of view, and indeed instituted their own group of missionaries. This third group is the most powerful within the cult, and are known as the “Reformed.” Acting as the public face of the cult, the Reformed are a large, sector-spanning network. They commonly preach that the God-Emperor had not a single cybernetic in the days when He walked amongst mortals, and that if He was pure of flesh, then so too should His subjects be. The Reformed mainly consist of Shriven who have reversed the process of bionic implantation, creating implants not of unholy cybernetics, but instead made out of pure (if sometimes misshapen) flesh. To the Reformed any inefficiencies or inferior function these parts have compared to the soulless steel they replaced is simply an expression of faith and piousness towards the very idea of the Pure Form itself.
### **Becoming a Cultist of the Pure Form**
There are many ways to be tempted to join the Cult of the Pure Form. For some, it is due to a feeling of betrayal, where replacement cybernetics have caused more harm than good, and the poor soul shackled by them is looking for a form of release among the ranks of the Shriven. Others, after hearing the words of the Reformed, have come to understand that the continued existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus is nothing but a disaster waiting to happen, and that it is their holy duty to stand in judgement of this abominable organisation. Others join out of a fear that if they begin to receive cybernetics that they will lose something of their own souls, and eagerly join the ranks of the Untouched to avoid this horrific fate. A select few might even be contacted directly by the cult’s senior members, as their membership would greatly benefit the cult’s standing and appeal across the Sector. The cult also offers a strong brotherhood and a cause to motivate new meaning into previously meaningless lives. Those who achieve such purity in their flesh may find their spirit even stronger than before, and certainly stronger than those who foolishly trust their bodies to the uncaring and dispassionate machine.

Upon becoming a member of the Cult of the Pure Form, the character gains the **Excommunicate Mechanicum Trait**.

**Required Career:** Any except Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Cleric—Rank 2 or higher (500 xp); All others—Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Any Acolyte who possess any bionics/cybernetics when taking this Alternate Rank must take the Purity of Flesh Talent before he may take any further Advances. Acolytes who do not possess any bionics/cybernetics when selecting this Rank must select the Gift of Purity Talent before they may take any further Advances.
#### **Trait: Excommunicate Mechanicum**
The Cult of the Pure Form is not a secretive group, in which members meet covertly in dank basements or crumbling hab blocks. They have made their presence felt and do not feel the need to hide their beliefs. The Mechanicus, in turn, view them as dangerous, misguided fools, and treat them with open disdain at best optimal servitor components at worst. Should any member of the Machine Cult learn of the Acolyte’s true allegiance, there could be dire consequences. If discovered, treat any member of the Mechanicus as having the lowest possible Disposition towards the character (and vice versa). The GM may even, in extreme situations, determine that acts of outright violence might be called for. Additionally, all forms of Interaction—even just speaking with members of the Machine Cult—are to be treated as **Arduous (–40)** before factoring in other modifiers.

*† This Talent has no xp cost, but can only be selected under specific circumstances. See each Talent's description for details.*
#### **Talent: Gift of Purity**
The Acolyte has forsaken the cybernetic, cast out the desire for the bionic, and joined the ranks of the Untouched. Never will sacred flesh be sullied by the implantation of devices that rob the Acolyte of his purity. The character cannot, under any circumstances, choose or accept the implantation of cybernetics/bionics, even if the result of refusing them would result in certain death. If the character finds himself implanted with cybernetics/bionics against his will, then he must remove them as soon as possible, replacing this Talent with the Purity of Flesh instead. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase, and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have no cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank.
#### **Talent: Purity of Flesh**
The Acolyte has participated in the Purity of Flesh ritual and emerged alive. Taking his place amongst the Shriven, he has become truly blessed, and despite his missing limbs, eyes, and other organs, he feels more complete now than he ever did with his soulless metallic attachments. All cybernetics and bionics that the character had previously must be removed, including internal cybernetic implants. If doing so would normally result in the character’s death, such as in the case of a Bionic Respiratory System, the character must also take the Reformed Skin Talent to provide a life-saving replacement, permanently reducing his Toughness by 1d5 and Wounds by 1.

The effects of removing cybernetic implants is similar to sustaining [Critical Damage](injury%20and%20healing.md#serious%20injuries%20and%20conditions) and the Acolyte should be attended to by a trained medicae to reduce the risk of death from the process. Augmetics that provide additional specific effects, such as a mind impulse unit or bio-power cells, cease to do so once removed from the body. The character gains 1 additional Fate Point (up to a maximum of 5) for every two bionics that he has removed (with the exception of Mechadendrites). The character must remove each and every augmetic from his body before he receives this benefit, so characters with quite a few may need to spend considerable downtime recuperating between surgeries (allowing their Critical Damage to heal) before they increase their Fate Points. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank. The character counts as having the Gift of Purity Talent for the purposes of refusing new cybernetics.
#### **Talent: Reformed Skin**
For those Acolytes who prefer to remain whole physically as well as spiritually they may take on entirely new flesh to replace the hateful cybernetics that have been removed. A Cultist of the Pure Form may select this Talent as many times as he has missing limbs, senses, or organs—any human body part replaced with a cybernetic or lost due to Critical Damage.

When taken, the Acolyte gains a replacement body part reclaimed from a servitor or an executed criminal. The replacement is not a perfect analogue for the Acolyte's original flesh, however, and imposes the same penalties that a Poor Craftsmanship cybernetic would (and, obviously, does not confer a bonus to his Toughness or a reduced chance of death from Critical Effects). Superior examples, vat-grown in bioreactors to closely match the Acolyte's body, may be purchased for 75% the cost of a cybernetic replacement instead—these effectively duplicate the Acolyte's missing parts and impose no penalties on their use (but still doesn't grant any special benefits or effects that an augmetic part might).

Any Fate Points gained from the Purity of Flesh Talent are lost when the missing parts are replaced with Reformed Skin, so the pious cultist should consider carefully how much he's willing to go without when considering a flesh-crafted replacement. Unless the missing body part would lead to inevitable death, such as a bionic cardiac system, the Acolyte is under no obligation to actually take this Talent. Reformed Skin costs no xp to purchase, though there may be a cost in Thrones if the Acolyte wishes to utilise a better quality part. 
## **Daemonym Seeker**

*“The most ideal of conditions for defeating the daemon: be on a first-name basis.”*

– High Banisher Segrin, Ordo Malleus
### **Background**
Within the Collegia Exterminatus it is considered a blessing that summoning a powerful daemon  is not easy; it can take a lifetime of devotion and years of preparation. Generational cults of worship exist that have secretive agendas hidden behind layers of faithful rhetoric. However, banishing or controlling a daemon is a far less difficult task if the summoner or banisher possesses the True Name of the daemon.

The True Name of even the most minor daemon is a closely guarded secret among warp entities. Knowing the True Name of a daemon gives one considerable power over that daemon, any minions of that daemon, and possibly even its worshippers. Most daemons are known by a variety of pseudonyms, should they desire to be called anything at all. However, among those who would use occult knowledge against mankind's greatest foe, there are some who would seek out the True Name of a daemon; they are called the Daemonym Seekers.

When a daemon hunter wishes to become a Seeker, there is no training or ceremony; he simply begins to hunt for the name of a specific warp entity. This may be a daemon who has given his Inquisitor trouble in the past or simply a beast that caught his attention during the course of his normal studies. Whatever his reasons, the Seeker devotes himself completely to the pursuit of this daemon's True Name.

The path of the Daemonym Seeker is rooted in the work of Inquisitor Adorjin. She was a potent psyker, and employed a great number of Banishers. Many of her Banishers considered her one of their own, as she forsook luxuries and the prestige of her title to pursue daemons with fervent determination. Adorjin devoted much of her life to hunting one vicious and particularly powerful warp entity which had infamously left a trail of carnage and damnation across numerous worlds of Segmentum Obscurus. For nearly two centuries she studied the creature as she pursued it, learning its True Name amid the trail of ruination and suffering caused by the daemon's plots. Eventually tracking it to the Calixis Sector, she brought with her several Banishers who had studied with her, a powerful relic weapon, and an ancient copy of the *Liber Daemonica*. Though she fell in the battle, the daemon was banished back to the warp for another century before it could unleash its latest machination upon the unsuspecting people of Calixis. Her strategies were adopted by a great many Banishers, and she is revered with saint-like piety by many among the Ordo Malleus of the Calixian Conclave.

Daemonym Seekers employ every resource they can in their search for the names of daemons, from the study of ancient prophesy to dangerous séances. The majority of Seekers devote their entire careers to the study of a particularly fell daemon, declaring that monster their nemesis and often growing to be obsessed with the target of their study. Daemonym Seekers are rarely trusted by any but the most radical of Inquisitors, and indeed, more than a few Seekers have had their quests (and sometimes lives) cut short by more puritanical members of the Inquisition who did not approve of the dark path such a pursuit demands. The Puritans’ judgement is not unwarranted; there are instances where Seekers have attempted to harness a daemon for the benefit of the Imperium, but such a noble effort almost always ends in tragedy. Worse, a few have secretly grown
to respect or worship the daemon they obsess over, becoming (witting or otherwise) Chaos cultists in all but name and laying bare the inner workings of the Inquisition to one of its most treacherous and cunning foes.
### **Becoming a Daemonym Seeker**
To become a Daemonym Seeker is to take up the single-minded cause of exterminating a great evil from the galaxy. There is no ceremony; there are no badges of office. Once you have set out on the path to discover the True Name of a warp fiend, you have taken it upon yourself to become the hunter, dogging your prey wherever it might try to feast its abominable desires. It will not be long before the beast knows that you are its enemy.

**Required Career:** Adept or Cleric
**Required Experience:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

#### **Talent: Daemonym**
Daemonym is actually a series of Talents available to the Daemonym Seeker, reflecting the character's growing knowledge of the daemon's True Name and special training in how to use that name against the daemon. This is a difficult undertaking, as the True Name of a daemon is usually very long and quite complex—the more powerful and ancient the daemon, the longer and more incomprehensible the name. Pronunciation must be exact, and the name may even have a melody, requiring the name to be sung. The GM should create the Daemon, if there is not a suitable one already in the campaign, and careful planning should be taken with regards to the character's motivations and how this zealous pursuit will effect the game.
##### **Minor Daemonym**
The character has begun to understand the very basics of the subject's True Name, granting a certain level of control over the worshippers of the daemon. While the devoted cult may know nothing of the daemon's true nature they are still susceptible to coercion and subtle manipulation by those who do understand the nature of the beast. When dealing with cultists who are servants of the chosen daemon the character gains a +10 bonus to any Interaction Tests, and at the GM's discretion may be able to command them as if the cultists were his subordinates.
##### **Lesser Daemonym**
The Seeker now begins to understand the True Name of the daemon on a conceptual level, giving him a significant amount of power over it. Armed with part of the daemon's True Name, the Seeker can sap some of the fearsome strength away from their powerful foe. The character gains a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack the daemon and any of its minions as well as a +10 bonus on any Tests made as part of a ritual against the daemon. Furthermore, any melee weapons counts as Sanctified against the daemon and its minions when the character wields it.
##### **Greater Daemonym**
The Seeker has mastery over his foe's True Name, understanding all its subtle nuances and pronunciation along with any other verbal or somatic cues needed to recite it. Within the Ordo Malleus puritans view this as pure heresy, whilst radicals see perhaps one of the most powerful weapons one can wield against the daemon. The character gains a +30 bonus to any Tests made as part of a ritual against the daemon, and may attempt to banish the daemon from the materium simply by repeatedly reciting its name (see Banishment below).

**Banishment:** As a Full Action the character makes a Literacy Test opposed by the daemon's Willpower. If the character succeeds reciting the daemon's True Name it suffers 1d10 Damage, plus another 1d10 for every degree of success the character achieves. This Damage is considered Sanctified, and is not reduced by the daemon's Armour (though it is reduced by Toughness). The Damage can be any type the GM deems appropriate. If the daemon is slain from Damage inflicted by Banishment it cannot return to the materium again for quite some time, and in any event is unlikely to cause the Acolytes any further trouble.
## **Demagogue**

*“You have been forsaken! You have been enslaved by lies, beaten by injustice, and bled by greed, but you have not bowed your heads or bent your knees. If it takes a thousand years and a river of blood, then so be it, but we will be free!”*

— Unidentified heretic on Tranch prior to the rising of the Pale Throng 
### **Background**
Demagogues are rabble rousers and agitators who can sway great crowds with their words. These fiery orators may be cult leaders, idealists, madmen, fanatics, or subtle manipulators and agent provocateurs. All, however, have the skill to draw crowds together with words, bind them with rhetoric, and loose them on a target like a pack of dogs. Worlds have burned because of the actions of such men and women. Some wish for nothing more than to see the world around them torn down and set aflame, to stoke the fires of anger and dissent to the point of an all-consuming inferno. Others are created by the injustices done to them or those around them, injustices that push the demagogue past the confines of society and into open insurrection against those in authority or anyone else the demagogue believes to have wronged them. Many Demagogues within the Imperium are touched with such conviction and faith that they use their skills to build crusades of the credulous and desperate.

Many, if not most, demagogues true believers, faithful and loyal to the Emperor in mind and action, but the consequences of their fomentations can be extremely dire for those in positions of power. Indeed, planet-wide sectarian conflicts, religious schism, and popular upheaval strong enough to threaten the Imperial tithe have all been started, likely quite unwittingly, by demagogues faithful to the Master of Mankind yet scorning of His temporal vassals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, to many Imperial authorities, these incendiary individuals are, for the most part, a menace whose activities must be controlled, and if necessary, curtailed—possibly with great and uncompromising force.

This is often more easily said than done. Rare is the Emperor-fearing demagogue who will willingly end their campaign of incitement under threats from authorities they already care little for in the first place. In some cases, productive negotiation has led to a cooling of tensions and a certain measure of redress for the demagogue's grievances, but this is more often the exception than the rule. Mutual animosity and irreconcilable differences have frequently led to short-sighted potentates having the demagogue silenced permanently, only to watch in horror as the demagogue's followers explode into completely uncontrollable revolt, anarchy, and destruction over their martyred leader's demise.

Persecuting recidivist demagogues, those who hold no great love for the Imperium or its institutions, can be even more of a thorny prospect. Many demagogues are adept at slipping through the Imperial society unseen and unaccounted for. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a recidivist demagogue to appear long enough to create a brushfire rebellion or riot, only to melt away when the authorities move against them and begin plans anew to replicate the destruction they have unleashed somewhere else. It matters not whether the demagogue is motivated by a personal conviction to see the forces and structure of ordered society burn, or if the act of inciting revolt is simply a profitable enterprise to be repeated for the demagogue's simple cupidity. These elusive agitators are the most dangerous and hunted variety of demagogue, and many are counted amongst the Calixis Sector's most notorious of rebels and heretics. 

Among Inquisitors of a less-puritanical mien a demagogue could be a very valuable asset. Some Inquisitors will train a demagogue in the art of incitement, effectively creating a rabble-rousing agent they can deploy where social unrest and disarray are needed. Others could be true recidivist demagogues co-opted by the Inquisition as a means of avoiding a far worse fate than instigating a crisis over a cause they don't believe in. Such "social" weapons are often deployed into situations where an Inquisitor has reason to believe the authority in question has fallen to corruption or heresy, but either lacks the means to prove it to the more staid Adeptus, or the unique circumstances of the situation preclude simply arresting or removing said authority by the Inquisitor's own prerogative.

It has been said by some (albeit in decidedly hushed tones) within the halls of Lord Hax's Lucid Palace that the mutant uprising on Tranch was the product of just such an Inquisitorial gambit. Sensing that the slowly growing unrest within Tranch's soot warrens would inevitably lead to an uprising against that world's feckless oligarchs, a handful of radical Recongregationist Inquisitors hatched a bold scheme. The Recongregationists, already entirely dismissive of the planetary authorities, believed that the mutant Shroud Masters of Tranch would use the uprising to launch a massive uprising of other mutants and abhumans across the entire Sector. 

Instead of trying to prevent the uprising in the first place—deemed to be a hopeless prospect in light of Tranch's brutal and deeply ingrained discord—the Recongregationists took several steps to deliberately accelerate the upheaval. This included sending in a cadre of trained demagogues explicitly to agitate the discontent of the soot warren dwellers. The scheme worked, and the world was in full revolt in a matter of months. The Shroud Masters, caught by surprise as the uprising they were carefully preparing suddenly and fiercely launched right out from under them, were not yet in a position to propagate the revolution to the other hive worlds of Calixis. Their master plan thwarted, the Shroud Masters scattered as the Imperial Guard retook the rebelling world spire by spire and hive by hive. Of no minor footnote, the larger body of the Inquisition ousted Tranch's surviving oligarchs, deeming them collectively guilty of such dereliction and incompetence as to have all but caused the revolt in the first place.

If this pernicious rumour is to be believed, the Recongregationists were broadly successful. The Shroud Masters' Sector-wide uprising was suppressed before it could begin, Tranch's inefficacious oligarchs were either killed or replaced, and Calixis had millions fewer mutants by the time the Imperial Guard regiments were being demobilised. Officially, the Inquisition has rigorously denied that any such scheme existed. This is just as well, as if there was any truth to it, the supposed Recongregationists would do well to keep their actions secret even from their peers. Even disregarding the millions of dead civilians and Guardsmen, the near-total destruction of Tranch's economy and much of its infrastructure brought about by a planetary revolt literally instigated by the radicals could have them accused of sedition, if not outright heresy.
### **Becoming a Demagogue**
Demagogues who serve radical Inquisitors usually assume the role through necessity. When you are charged with bringing blood and destruction or instigating fundamental changes in the structure of Imperial authority, the ability to create a riot, instigate a mutiny, and foment rebellion is useful indeed. Talented orators and socially adept Acolytes may embrace this role and dedicate themselves to perfecting its finer points, while some are thrust towards it by their master. While it is their best-known talent, demagogues are not limited to practising their social graces before large crowds, and any Acolyte cell could benefit from having a master of rhetoric and persuasion to aid them when the bullets and las blasts aren't flying. 

**Required Career:** Adept, Cleric, Imperial Psyker, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp)

## **Frateris Militia**

*“My militia of faithful, you may not be clad in the blessed flak armour of the Imperial Guard. You may not bring the Emperor’s wrath through the barrel of the righteous lasgun. What you lack in the Imperium’s most blessed weapons of war you replace with fervour and faith. No army forged can stand before the might of the Emperor’s judgement wrought by our hands.”*

– Abbot Vonn Schtiel
### **Background**
Since the dark days of Sebastian Thor’s great reformation, the Ministorum has been prevented, by the dictates of the Decree Passive, from maintaining forces that consist of “men at arms.” Although this statute put an end to the vast standing armies of the ancient Ecclesiarchy, the archaic wording of the decree has been subjected to many abuses and creative interpretations over the centuries, and only a fool would assume that the Ecclesiarchy lacks military power.

In times of great need—wars of faith and crusades, but also revolts and disasters—Ecclesiastical authorities will arm its male servants, both from the clergy and the mass of lay followers. A great mass of clerks, Deacons, Pardoners, and other minor functionaries swarm from the great temples and cathedrals, armed with whatever weapons they can lay their hands upon. To some, they are nothing but a disorganised rabble, a greater threat to themselves than to any opposing force, but on many occasions a hastily-assembled Frateris Militia have been known to perform tremendous acts of courage and valour in the name of the Emperor. Though rarely mentioned by the remembrancers once the conflict has passed, more than a few worlds have been saved from xenos invasion and the forces of rebellion by the fervent defence of a legion of Ecclesiastical militiamen.

Members of the Frateris Militia are not professional soldiers, and receive no formal training in their role, although frontier diocese and those on politically unstable worlds have been known to drill their able-bodied clergy on basic military tactics (on a strictly unofficial basis, of course). However, their faith is strong, and what they lack in standardised equipment and manuals of arms they make up for with zeal to serve the God-Emperor.

One of the many legends of St. Drusus involves a close friend and confidant, Abbot Rempsi. As a young man Rempsi had been drafted into the Frateris Militia and joined the crusade to return the Calyx Expanse into the Imperial fold. He was a fiery orator whose rage was barely contained even when not surrounded by the bloodshed of combat. The survival rate of most Frateris Militia during the Angevin Crusade was poor by any standards, but Rempsi managed to survive a dozen conflicts before he met Drusus, providing spiritual counsel to the lay members and urging them on to great feats of bravery once the battle was enjoined.

According to the legend, while in transit to the next war zone a great warship carrying both Imperial Guard and Frateris Militia was assailed by blind, void-dwelling xenos which swarmed through the vessel's halls and atriums hungry for a meal of human flesh. Locked in a bulkhead with several dozen Frateris Militia, Drusus battled alongside Rempsi, holding the choke point leading to the enginarium. Eventually overrun, dozens of xenos rushed through the corridors and would soon overwhelm the enginarium and snuff out the ship's plasma cores. The young Rempsi bellowed with rage and disgust at the abominable force before him, and his militia followed him headlong towards the enemy, only to abruptly stop a few dozen metres short. Peaceful calm washed over them as they began to loudly recite the Litany of Refusal. Overwhelmed by the sonorous chanting, the xenos were repelled, unable to come within striking distance of the Frateris Militia and saving the ship. Drusus knew that he had witnessed a miracle. Abbot Rempsi was forever changed, his spittle-hurling rage replaced by steadfastness and serene determination in the will of the God-Emperor. Rempsi spent much of the rest of the crusade as one of Drusus' most phlegmatic and composed advisers, and is still revered today by the stoic and composed throughout the Sector.
### **Becoming a Frateris Militia**
Those who serve the Ecclesiarchy are often drafted into the Frateris Militia to serve in times of need. While not formally trained or given a wage as members of a proper military would be, they are excused from other official duties during their service. Anyone with strong loyalty to the Ecclesiarchy and a willingness to take up arms against mankind's enemies could have served in a Frateris Militia, and any Inquisitor worth his salt would value a man of faith who also happens to be proficient in combat as a member of an Acolyte cell.

**Required Career:** Adept, Cleric, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp).
**Militia Service:** A character who replaces Rank 1 with Frateris Militia also replaces all starting equipment with a Las Carbine or Hunting Rifle and 2 reloads, Aquila Necklace, a Charm, a Knife, a backpack and a Flak Vest.
**Brothers in Arms:** As the name implies, only male characters may become members of a Frateris Militia. With the (very) notable exception of the Adepta Soroitas, the Ecclesiarchy disdains the idea of expending women in combat.

## **Magistrate**

*"The law demanded that we take action! The crimes of House Torald could not go unpunished. Of course, we had sufficient justification to intervene. The Lex Calixis, volume 65c is clear on the matter. Chapter 2076, subsection 776, paragraph 876, widely recognised as the 'Warptime disjunction clause' clearly excuses the apparent lack probable cause for action against the accused House. Should this court find the aforementioned action against House Torald unlawful and thereby strip all findings from the accumulated evidence, this court would be setting a dangerous precedent, which could have disastrous repercussions for Arbites actions throughout the whole of the Calixis Sector. I trust this Honourable Court, in its infinite justice and wisdom will make the right decision. Your Lordships."*

– Veglan Hesk, Magistrate, Hive Subrique
### **Background**
To enforce every mandate within the enormity of the Lex Imperialis is a nearly impossible task; even the truncated Lex Calixis is a daunting endeavour. These codices of law are so enormously dense that few individuals can claim to know all of their secrets (or loopholes). Even the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites must regularly confer with archive-savants and librarium cogitation engines in order to make their rulings. Working for planetary enforcers or powerful nobles during trials by court, legal experts known as Magistrates make up a group of rare minds primarily concerned with matters of Imperial law. These steadfast scholars spend decades poring over the Lex Calixis, learning its every nuance and interpretation. Magistrates of each Calixian sub-sector are tasked with mastering not only the greater Lex Calixis, but also their own planet's specific laws as well. As
such, the Magistrates stationed on any of the Sector's central worlds may be called upon to aid Nobles and Governors across the Sector.

Simply regurgitating chapters of the Lex Calixis is not all that the Magistrates are tasked with by their lords. Every world in the Calixis Sector is governed by its own set of laws. As long as the Imperial tithe flows, and they do not fall into heresy or rebellion, planetary authorities are generally allowed to rule as they see fit. As these local traditions and practices may have been enshrined into planetary law for hundreds of years, even high authorities like the Adeptus Arbites, off-planet nobles, and the forces of the Inquisition itself will often prefer to act in a strictly legal capacity without raising unnecessary eyebrows or resorting to more aggressive tactics. Many a Magistrate, calmly at study within massive law libraries or comfortably litigating disputes in court, have found themselves cashiered to accompany a cell of Acolytes, a Rogue Trader, or a profit-seeking noble to some far-off world that they have only studied in dusty tomes of planetary law.

As well, it is the purview of the Magistrates to assert the legal rightness of the actions of their lords. Whether it is to give legal resistance for Arbites action before they are taken or, post hoc, to legitimise hostile movements long under way, it is up to the Magistrates to make sure that their masters are always within the edicts of the Lex Calixis. To this end it is the duty of the Magistrates to know the ways in which the Lex Calixis is lacking—to know the loopholes and ambiguities within the law which might be stretched to allow necessary, but otherwise illegitimate, action. This directive is particularly useful for Inquisitors whose investigations have brought them into conflict with the Adeptus Arbites. Officially, Inquisitors are above Imperial law, as matters of heresy trump just about all other edicts and legal immunities. With that said, most Judges and Precinct Marshals bristle at the self-righteous actions of Inquisitors who flaunt the law in their persecution of heretics, and only a foolish Inquisitor who continually draw the ire of such a powerful force as the Adeptus Arbites. A Magistrate capable of interpreting Imperial legal texts in such a way as to avoid conflict with both the Arbitrators and planetary enforcers is a valuable asset, one most Inquisitors would be glad to have among their cadre of Acolytes.

Unfortunately, there are those who view such treatment of the law as the gravest of sins. These consummate legalists see those who would use the letter of the Lex Calixis for their own ends as little more than clever criminals, reprobates in robes who deserve the harshest censure for their perversion of the spirit of the law itself. Combined with the not-uncommon distrust felt for overly scholarly members of the Arbites, Magistrates are generally not a popular lot in the Calixis Sector. Nevertheless, the expertise of the Magistrates is necessary for many, and they are therefore at least tolerated by their peers. 

Within Calixis Magistrates often undergo their education on Scintilla or Malfi, privately tutored by other Magistrates and forming informal legal societies under the auspices of small councils of senior experts of the profession. Others are so-called "foreign adepts" of the Adeptus Administratum, assigned to the Calixis Sector as a post of service by distant masters. This is as further ire to the more sceptical members of the Adeptus Arbites, who see the goings-on of the Magistrates within the Calixis Sector as being meddled with by outsiders. The fact that these foreigners seem to take a dimmer view to the Sector's authorities, apparently working to constrain their legal actions more than empower them, does little to improve this outlook.

A great many Magistrates are master orators as well, not only versed in the law, but capable of swaying stalwart Judges and uncompromising Arbitrators with their legal rhetoric. This is yet another skill for which they are valued and distrusted and equal measures. With a keen mind and a powerful force of personality, a Magistrate can be a righteous agent of the Imperial justice, tearing apart the legal walls and veils that well-heeled evildoers hide behind. Alternatively, he could just as easily be a canny scofflaw, a statuary mercenary who flaunts the edicts he so rigorously claims to love for a healthy pay package from amoral clients. For this reason the typical Magistrate must work hard to earn the trust of his peers, a task which can take decades, if not centuries. Magistrates are present throughout the halls of power in Calixis, and despite this somewhat unfair reputation as protectors of lawbreakers, most tend to be on the side of the lawgivers. By their knowledge of the law and powerful presence in court Imperial criminals are brought swiftly—and legally—to justice.
### **Becoming a Magistrate**
When an Adept wishes to journey into the legal libraries, they normally need only make their intentions known to their superiors. Unfortunately for such Adepts in the Calixis Sector, the stigma against such scholarly pursuits makes for a difficult road in the journey to legal expertise and oratory prowess. Often shunned or derogated by their masters for expressing such interests, many of those wishing to become Magistrates pursue tutelage from one of the Sector's informal legal societies, entering into a sort of fraternal order of like-minded individuals. Such Magistrates tend to hail from a common background of overcoming socially adverse conditions to pursue their trade, and many enter the realm of litigation treating the law as a sacred, inviolate bulwark against anarchy. These individuals are just as likely to scorn well-intentioned Arbitrators for overstepping legal technicalities as they are the criminals the Arbites are persecuting. The so-called "foreign" Magistrates, on the other hand, are more likely to view the law as a malleable, living thing to be applied to the unique parameters of each case. Consequently, these Magistrates could be a strong ally to the Arbites, bending the law in the favour of the lawgivers with the goal of confirming the criminal's guilt, or a nattering nemesis that make "walking" the accused a matter of sport.

The Acolyte is adept at flooding a target with legal jargon and facts to befuddle, confound, and even cow them. The Acolyte may use Scholastic Lore (Judgement) as if it were the Blather or Intimidate Skills. This ability only works on targets for whom the laws of the Imperium hold at
least a modicum of fear. A ganger or Imperial citizen is likely at least knowing of the law, if not necessarily very wary about it, whilst a Chaos Legionnaire almost certainly wouldn't be. The GM should decide which targets are or are not affected by this Talent as necessary.
## **Malefic Scholar**

*"If you wish him dead I can oblige, though you may be able to affect such an end yourself without recourse to my arts. My speciality is the manipulation of events to violent ends by malign artifice; chiefly war, tragedy and rebellion. If that is not what you desire then perhaps it is not I that you seek."*

—Corwainious Tare, daemonologist
### **Background**
A Malefic Scholar studies and acquires proscribed knowledge concerning the quintessence of the warp, the power and nature of daemons, and the manipulation of the immaterium by the arts of ritual and sorcery. These are the wizened masters of warp craft who can summon daemons, open portals into the ether, see things far off and days remote, and create artefacts of occult and unclean power. Such dedication is motivated by an obsession with knowing what should not be known, or by the desire to wield unnatural power that is beyond that open to most humans. The power of a Malefic Scholar has potential that is only bound by the weakness of the human mind when confronted with truths greater than it can cope with.

Forbidden knowledge is bought with unspeakable acts, obsessive pursuit of foul tomes, occult artefacts, incunabula, and long study. Given the fragmentary and often contradictory nature of the Dismal Texts, the practice of warp craft requires long experimentation and a considerable intellect. The effects of such study and practise are corrosive to body and soul. Most Malefic Scholars go mad and are slowly eaten by the cancerous nature of the things they know. Many succumb to daemonic influence and possession or become monstrous things ruled by their malignancy and dwindle into darkness and a life lived in nightmares. Some simply vanish, lost to an eternity of suffering at the hands of the forces they sought to understand and control. The absolute worst retain some semblance of their former selves, but have completely given themselves over in service to the Ruinous Powers, becoming a vile scourge to their fellow man and threatening to burn entire worlds.

Most Malefic Scholars are an obvious threat to the fabric and security of the Imperium; their pursuit of forbidden knowledge can unleash warp entities, provide a point of incursion for daemons and may corrupt all they touch. For Inquisitors of Radical factions which embrace the use of warp craft, a Malefic Scholar is a valuable servant and weapon to be used to fight the enemies of mankind. In the service of a Radical Inquisitor a Malefic Scholar will find undreamt of access to sources of forbidden lore and endless opportunities to expand their knowledge.
### **Becoming a Malefic Scholar**
Becoming a Malefic Scholar is a conscious choice on the part of an Adept who wishes to pursue forbidden knowledge and sorcery. Beyond this the character must have in-game access to a source of Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) and or Scholastic Lore (Occult), such as a tome containing arcane writings, or contact with an individual who has such knowledge. On entering this career, an adept gains 1d10 Corruption Points and 1d10 Insanity Points.

**Required Career:** Adept
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp).

## **Ordo Sicarius Initiate**

"Some may be able to avoid the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites. Fewer may be able to face off against the Imperial Guard, and perhaps even the Adeptus Astartes. None can stand against the Officio Assassinorum."

— Tarik Ziz, Callidus Director Secundus
### **Background**
At the end of the Age of Apostasy and Goge Vandire’s despotic rule came a shadow conflict few have heard of and many participants did not survive: the Wars of Vindication within the Officio Assassinorum. The Officio had become riddled with corruption, and the Grand Master of Assassins was forced to kill many of its members in order to fully eliminate those still loyal to the deposed High Lord or who had fallen into irredeemable degeneracy during his rule. The Officio’s hierarchy was utterly shattered and needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, and for a time there was some discussion amongst the new High Lords that the Officio itself might be dissolved. 

As fellows of clandestine warfare, the Inquisition came to the Officio Assassinorum's aid during this moment of great peril. Following a thorough investigation and taking of accounts, Inquisitor Jaeger of the Ordo Hereticus deemed that a special order of the Inquisition would be created to help rebuild the Officio, and subsequently monitor and control some of its functions much more
closely than had occurred before. His proposal was accepted, and the Ordo Sicarius was created, with Jeager as its first Lord Inquisitor. As the Officio Assassinorum is a highly secretive branch of the Imperial hierarchy, Jeager and his henchmen understood that maintaining a typical hierarchy of control was out of the question. To preserve the Officio's ability to rive seamlessly through Imperial society the Ordo Sicarius would not maintain any formal structures outside it, instead fulfilling their duty by planting Assassin-Acolytes and, indeed, a few Inquisitors within their ranks. 

The masters of the Assassinorum know of the existence of these Ordo Sicarius agents, but not their number, postings, or individual identities. The Assassinorum and Sicarius follow an informal set of guidelines toward their unusual arrangement. Officially, the Officio Assassinorum does not attempt to expose or identify Sicarius agents, but those who are identified are marked and reported as such to their masters, who will withdraw and reassign the "made" agent. In return, if a Sicarius agent does uncover heresy or some dire conspiracy within the Assassinorum, the Ordo Sicarius will work in cooperation with the rest of the Officio to excise the malignant element with an absolute minimum disruption to their operations. Once a Sicarius agent is "made", his time secreted within the Officio Assassinorum is over, but the Inquisition has a great many other tasks that an expert at deception and guile could turn their hands to.

One notable example of the Ordo Sicarius' work dates from the early years of the 39th Millennium. Praetor Golgenna Angevin, a well-connected noble of the Terran Court, was raised to the rank of Lord Militant and granted a writ to prosecute a crusade to liberate and return the worlds of the Calyx Expanse to the Imperial fold. Among a cadre of Angevin's trusted counsellors and chamberlains was a man by the name of Dario Vereschagin. Unknown to Angevin or any of the others at the time, this servant was in actuality one Inquisitor Treyus Godan of the Ordo Sicarius. Inquisitor Godan's purpose was to monitor Angevin's crusade and to determine, on behalf of the Inquisition, whether or not such a singularly powerful individual was still loyal to the Imperium and faithfully executing the duties he was charged with. If he was not, then it was Godan's duty to eliminate him before Angevin turned the vast forces of the Crusade towards his own ends. A number of members of the Inquisition were openly serving in the forces of the Crusade, and could ostensibly fulfil the same purpose as Godan, but if the Lord Militant did betray the Imperium these badge-wearing agents and Inquisitors could conceivably be eliminated, or worse, co-opted. Godan, then, could serve as an additional measure to guarantee Angevin's loyalty. 

As the Crusade entered its third and final stage, Godan personally witnessed Angevin's acclaimed General Drusus slain by a rogue assassin. When Drusus rose from the dead, Godan was one of the first of the Crusade's leaders to recognise him as a living saint, a sure sign that the God-Emperor had blessed the Crusade's success with His divinity. Capitalising on this moment, Godan "revealed" himself as an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and officially (albeit without any sort of formal authorisation) declared the Inquisition's support of the new living saint. Reinvigorated by this moment of holy righteousness (and significant resources diverted by Inquisitorial forces) the Crusade barrelled ahead with newfound vigour, and most of the remaining worlds of Calyx were returned to the God-Emperor's light not long thereafter. Critically, by making the resurrection of Drusus a matter of Inquisitorial import, the conspirators who had him assassinated were outed, and the possibility of a religious schism over whether Drusus was truly a living saint or not was quickly put to rest before it could threaten the Crusade's revitalised momentum.

Godan, for his part, was censured for impersonating an Inquisitor, but received clemency in light of the undeniable results of his duplicity, and disappeared from the record shortly thereafter. Only a few within the Inquisition ever knew Godan was a member of the Ordo Sicarius, much less had been clandestinely monitoring the Crusade's progress and guiding the hands of its leaders the entire time. To this day, even many within the Holy Ordos are only vaguely aware of the existence of the Sicarius in the first place, but few would doubt their capability at deception and the crafting of cover identities for deep infiltration. Inquisitors whose work entails delicate and surreptitious investigation are often pleased to have an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius in their service, although some might give pause to the notion that the Sicarius-trained Acolyte could be keeping tabs on them at the same time...
### **Becoming an Ordo Sicarius Initiate**
Becoming an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius is no simple feat. The Acolyte in question must be both a skilled warrior and very capable at subterfuge. The vast majority of its members were chosen for induction by Assassin-Inquisitors of the Ordo Sicarius itself, the prospective initiates merely given a dataslate with the name of a target, and a stated goal of "Interrogation and Extermination required" written underneath. How, or even if, the prospect goes about this mission is his decision. Assuming the assignment is successfully completed, and the work is judged to be adequate, the prospect is clandestinely taken to the Ordo Sicarius' main temple and begins his training in the ways of the Assassin-Inquisitors.

#### **Talent: Sicarius Training**
The time an Acolyte spends among the most ruthless and efficient agents of stealth, deception, and murder can manifest itself in all matters of ways. Acolytes who study with agents of the Callidus Temple learn the ways of deep infiltration and flawless disguise, whilst those who spend their time among the Vindicare become highly proficient lurkers and shadesmen who can slip through security like water through a sieve. Each time you purchase this Talent select one of the following benefits:

* **Arms Aficionado:** At some point you developed a particular interest in an unusual weapon, and the Ordo Sicarius has had you study with a master of that device to further your deadly ambitions. You gain an [Exotic Weapon Training](talents.md#exotic%20weapon%20training) Talent of your choice.

* **Thought Mapping:** Infiltrator-savants of the Sicarius have taught you the science of predicting lines of questioning, and through logistaristic formulae you can often predict the path of a conversation well ahead of those you're speaking with. You may substitute your Intelligence Characteristic in place of Fellowship when making Inquiry Tests.
* **Well Connected:** A myriad of false identities, pulled strings, and brazen yet surprisingly convincing lies has created a persona with contacts in a useful organisation or social group. You gain a [Peer](talents.md#peer) Talent of your choice.

## **Saboteur**

*"Any problem in the world can be solved with the careful application of high explosives. The trick is not to be around when they go off."*

— Attributed to an ancient Terran warlord
### **Background**
 It is said by some of the more philosophically-minded Administratum thralls that everything within the Imperium is connected by endless invisible threads of interdependence, a vast web of commerce, trade, and movement of men that binds the whole together. From the astropathic messages brought to the table of a lord, to the food eaten by the lowest worker in a forge, all depends on something else to exist, and those in turn on other things. These threads of reliance form a vast entanglement of power and stability on which order, faith, and indeed survival itself depends. It is the destruction of these threads that is the Saboteur’s purpose, and for many, their most beloved art.

Saboteurs are craftsmen of panic, destruction, and downfall—sometimes all three at once! They are the loosed dogs of secret wars of destabilisation and terror that rage in the shadows of the Imperium of Mankind. Trained to move unseen amongst the great flocks of humanity, the Saboteur is a faceless agent of fear, mayhem, and death that attacks the physical and psychological fabric that binds the Imperium together. Many act as tools or proxies of larger conspiracies, sowing fear among the people and crippling the local authorities' means to resist the hideous plans of the Saboteur's employers. Others ply their trade for their own goals alone, seeking to topple institutions and spires out of personal animus for the rulers and powerful, or even just for the perverse joy of destruction itself.

Acolytes of the Inquisition are most likely to encounter a Saboteur in the course of an investigation, and will almost certainly be attempting to thwart the Saboteur's plans before they can threaten the very fabric of Imperial society. Yet, it is also not unheard-of for such cold monsters of terror to be found in the service of an Inquisitor. While unconventional in the main, it is true that grand conspiracies and heretical sects often depend on their own networks of information and material to enact their vile plots. Once uncovered, these can be severed with explosives and other clandestine, underhanded tactics just as easily, if not more so, than with a Storm Trooper deployment or a raid by an Arbites Suppression Squad. 

Sometimes a very deeply-rooted heresy can corrupt planetary authorities to its will or ephemerally secret itself within local institutions, becoming all but undetectable to even the all-seeing eye of the Inquisition. In such situations, a more radical Inquisitor might set loose Saboteur Acolytes to destabilise those very organisations, depriving the heretics of the facade of normality and pushing them out into the open. The cost in both infrastructure and innocent lives is often high, but those who would deliberately send an entire hive into anarchy to expose dire conspiracies within its guild halls and enforcer forts are quick to point out that a more "conventional", that is to say brute force, approach would likely be even worse.
### **Becoming a Saboteur**
A Saboteur's qualifications are deceptively simple: move surreptitiously and cause a great deal of targeted destruction. A Saboteur Acolyte will often lean on the training and institutional knowledge of his existing Career to identify structural and organisational weaknesses, areas where a little explosives or poison gas will have outsize effects on the body he's been called to cripple. No two Saboteurs are alike, and such an Acolyte is just as likely to be a dutiful servant calmly practising a trade for his master as he is to be a barely-contained menace, gleefully terrorising his fellow men with official justification that's often entirely too flimsy.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp).

## **Slate-Agent**

*"And who am I to be this year, hmm? A wealthy functionary in a dubious merchant guild? No? Hmm, perhaps a pampered Ecclesiastic keeping watch for detestable heresy within a suspect sect? Still no, eh? Well then, can I spend the majority of this mission indoors at least? Another Imperial Guard unit? How do heretics keep managing to sneak into those! Well at least I won't remember any of it after retrieval..."*

— A Slate-Agent, currently named Cavel Posdanik
### **Background**
On the planet of Malfi, a place often considered the "second capital" of the Calixis Sector, the men and women of the ruling class play a vicious game of politics and favour. This game is played not on any game-board, but in every palace, mansion, and villa. It is not played with pieces, but with the livelihood of their dynasties. The strategy of this game lies with political manoeuvring and favourable alliances. The stakes of this game are neither bragging rights nor pride, they are the very existence of the noble family, and the rights of rulership. The greatest advantage in this game of political infighting is information, preferably that which could shame and discredit a rival. In the pursuit of this sort of information the noble houses of Malfi have each developed methods particular to their own dynasty. It was for this purpose that the first Slate-Agents were trained. The Malfian house which first created the Slate-Agents is long forgotten, whether fallen to obscurity or risen to heights beyond all recognition, none can say. What is well known, however, is the efficacy of the Slate-Agent as a spy and operative. The secrets of creating a Slate-Agent escaped the Malfian backstabber-lords over a century ago, and other powerful organisations in Calixis — namely the Inquisition and the Adeptus Arbites — are known to employ these unique savant-moles for deep undercover work.

Masters of subterfuge and disguise, each Slate-Agent is a perfect operative of infiltration and observation. It is the gruelling process of their creation which makes a Slate-Agent so optimally crafted for their intended job. The first stage of a Slate-Agent's conditioning is aimed at wholly annihilating any sense of self possessed by the recruit, reducing them to little more than a biological machine in the service of their masters. It is from this state that Slate-Agents receive  heir moniker, as from this point forward, each Agent is a "blank-slate" on which new identities can be written. To achieve this, recruits are deprived of sleep, food, water, and dignity, as well as forced to endure horrific psychological torments, all the while they are watched for signs of opposition or rebelliousness. Once the recruit has been reduced to an entirely pliant and workable state, the trainers begin the slow process of rebuilding their charge. Using incredibly complex and methodical hypno-indoctrination techniques they prepare the recruit's mind to take shape around cover-identities, each of which includes skills, history, profession, and contacts, as well as personality and mannerisms, all combined to provide a flawless cover for the Slate-Agent. The trainers use psycho-conditioning to thread the recruit's psyche with triggers and fail-safes, in order to reset the conditioning once their mission is complete. Oft-times the conditioning of Slate-Agents is so complete that during their missions they are wholly unaware of their true identity until their loyalty is tested, at which point, deep-planted hypno-barriers close off the mind to any possibility of traitorous or mutinous thoughts.

Gathering information about one's target is the primary directive of each Agent. Infiltrating a targeted organisation, gaining access to its members' most heavily guarded secrets, and leaving no doubt as to their unfaltering loyalty to their target, these are the core objectives of each Slate- Agent's mission. The specifics may change depending on the Slate-Agent's controller and his targeted organisation, but information is the primary stock and trade of the Slate-Agent. For Malfian agents, having an ally so flawlessly inserted into an enemy's ranks often proves a dangerous temptation, for it is a simple thing to include a kill-order alongside the multitude of mundane orders during the templating process. This form of assassination is harshly frowned upon by the Malfian courts, although only because it would swiftly become a form of mutually assured destruction were this practice to become accepted. For Slate-Agents employed by other organisations, of course, there's often far less hesitation to deploy such an operative for both intelligence-gathering and murder should the opportunity arise.

Malfian Slate-Agents are often considered to be costly but ultimately disposable tools of espionage, meant to be deeply secreted within a rival house to feed information to their masters for as long as possible. Given the ever-changing nature of Inquisitorial work, those Slate-Agents who have been conditioned for use by agents of the Inquisition are often more aware of their true identity, at least subconsciously, and have even been known to have been templated with a multitude of identities at the same time. Slate-Agents in the employ of an Inquisitor can be seen as more of a deck of cards, able to flawlessly shift into a different cover identity as the needs of the mission dictate. This makes them an exceptional weapon to infiltrate corrupt organisations and heretical cults, and unlike the Malfian power-players, the Inquisition is absolutely not above utilising a Slate-Agent to terminate key members of a group they've been secreted into.
### **Becoming a Slate-Agent**
There is no set procedure by which men and women are chosen to become Slate-Agents. Functionally a softer form of mind-cleansing, the process is still painful and harrowing, and only the most absolutely devoted, penitent, or deranged would wholly volunteer to undergo the templating. Many Slate-Agents are coerced into the role by their masters, while others are all but forced to be "slated" as a form of penance for a severe failure. Inquisitors with a more whimsical idea of justice have been known to compel spies who have been caught infiltrating Inquisitorial properties or organisations to accept becoming a Slate-Agent. This allows the outsider to turn their existing talents at subterfuge to the Inquisition's benefit while giving a very effective guarantee of their loyalty to their new masters.

Upon becoming a Slate-Agent, the character gains the **Blank Slate Trait**.

**Required Career**: Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** [Unremarkable](talents.md#unremarkable) Talent
#### **Trait: Blank Slate**
The Acolyte is imprinted with several psychic triggers, known only to his handler. These triggers serve as prompts for the Slate-Agent’s identity programming. One trigger wipes the Slate-Agent’s mind clean of previous imprinting. Another prepares the Agent’s mind for re-programming. When a Slate-Agent is imprinted, the GM and the player may choose three [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore), [Forbidden Lore](skills.md#forbidden%20lore), [Scholastic Lore](skills.md#scholastic%20lore), or [Trade](skills.md#trade) Skills appropriate for the Acolyte’s cover identity. Until the Agent’s imprinting is wiped clean, the Slate-Agent is considered to possess all chosen Skills, and gains a +10 bonus on related Tests.

While an Acolyte's cover identity is "active" the Acolyte completely and totally believes himself to be that person, and even successful [Interrogation](skills.md#interrogation) will only reveal details about the Acolyte's templated persona. Psychic Powers such as [Mind Scan](telepathy.md#mind%20scan) will still reveal the Acolyte's actual identity and the fact that he's had a different identity templated onto him, however. The Acolyte loses all memories of his time under the active cover identity once the trigger is given to wipe his templating, so it is absolutely essential to fully debrief the Slate-Agent before attempting to prepare a new cover identity.

The triggers used to prepare and wipe a Slate-Agent's persona templates must remain absolutely secret, known only to the controller. Should the triggers become known to anyone else that party could implant their own template onto the Slate-Agent, possibly turning him against his masters or to some other no-doubt nefarious purpose.

## **Tyrantine Shadow Agent**

*"Lest the truth devour all."*

— Memento Mori of Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos
### **Background**
The Inquisition, some say, is an empire of secrets. To outsiders, this is certainly the case, for in stern judgement and shrouded in mystery the Holy Ordos sit above them like wrathful gods, little understood and rightly feared. But what is not so widely known by outsiders is that there are many secrets the Inquisition keeps from its own, either because it is expedient to do so, or because they are simply too dangerous even for some members of the Ordos to know. These secrets are often held through invisible webs of patronage, fealty and alliance, but sometimes manifest themselves though shadow empires: whole organisations hidden under the wider umbrella of the Holy Ordos whose nature and concerns remain mysterious even to other Inquisitors and Acolytes.

Inside the Calixian Conclave, there is no greater divider than the Hereticus Tenebrae, more informally known as the Tyrant Star, and the Tyrantine Cabal is one such secretive and insular group striving to uncover the true nature of its menace. The supreme danger of the Star is not known to all even within the Inquisition’s own ranks. Even those who do know something rarely have anything but a piece of the puzzle, and there are many who dismiss the calamitous phenomena of the Tyrant Star as mere coincidence or superstitions. In no small part, the Tyrantine Cabal is responsible for maintaining this ignorance, just as much as it is investigating what the Hereticus Tenebrae represents and how to combat it.

As the years have progressed, this web of secrecy and control has taken on a life almost of its own, and methods and agencies have sprung up to support it and its master’s goals. One such powerful agency is the Tenebrae Collegium—a shadow empire all of its own founded by the cynical genius of the renowned Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. The Collegium takes the most promising and suitable of Acolytes and transforms them into subtle and lethal instruments of deception, whose true allegiances can remain secret even from the Inquisitors they serve. These Acolytes are perfectly suited to keeping the Tyrantine Cabal's purposes hidden and enacting its will without remorse or apprehension. The existence of the Collegium and its so-called “shadow agents” is a matter officially denied by the Cabal and the source of much secret debate, suspicion, and contentious enmity within the Conclave Calixis as a whole. How far does its reach stretch? How many agents does it have? And what darkness might go undiscovered lurking at the heart of such a strange and hidden power? Few know, but many outside the Cabal have grave misgivings, and it is entirely likely that its most entrenched detractors have fashioned their own secret networks to oppose the Tyrantines' scheming.

It is said Cassilda Cognos once quipped, in a moment of levity, that the Collegium “took outstanding dissemblers and accomplished liars and then began their work”. Certainly, the results of the Collegium’s conditioning do produce agents more than capable of moving through the Imperium in a carefully woven fog of falsity and misdirection. Using tiny gestures, key words and cadences, two agents can communicate vital information in the presence of others who remain none the wiser. Furthermore, using psychic and mental conditioning, a graduate of the Collegium can close his mind to all but the most destructive psychic probing, concealing his deepest secrets around a labyrinth of half truths and falsity to confuse, making them not only extraordinarily proficient spies and agents, but near-impregnable living vaults for the secrets of the Cabal.

The ultimate purpose of these Tyrantine agents is to firstly hold the Cabal above all other masters, to pursue knowledge of the Tyrant Star, and to keep that knowledge safe from all outside the Cabal’s covetous circle. In most cases, these goals coincide with the agent’s duties as Acolytes of the Ordos Calixis. However, where their true loyalties have come into conflict with the Adepta or even immediate superiors outside of the Cabal, this has led to cold and brutal conflict with those the agent would ordinarily call their lords, comrades, or even friends. So far, the Cabal has managed to keep all such “difficulties” from wider knowledge. The time may come, though, when the fate of all is at stake and they will have to act no matter what the cost. Perhaps a civil war will erupt within the Ordos Calixis as a result. This is a nightmare, however, that this secret empire, this order within an order, must bear, for their own fearful secrets are as nothing to the dangers of the Hereticus Tenebrae, and some must be sacrificed lest its truth devour all.
### **Becoming a Tyrantine Shadow Agent**
The path of the Tyrantine Shadow Agent is to be a spy among spies, his true loyalties hidden from his ostensible master. Shadow Agents are always vigilant for any new information about the Tyrant Star they can acquire, and then just as driven to jealously guard it from the prying eyes of those outside the Cabal. By default this demands the Shadow Agent conspire against the trust of his master and his fellow Acolytes, keeping his ultimate objectives hidden from any not deemed worthy of the Cabal's dread knowledge. An Acolyte being revealed as a Shadow Agent would face formal censure from their Inquisitor at best, and could suffer a far worse fate if their master is a more vindictive or covetous soul. For those who maintain their clandestine charge, however, loyal service to their true masters will in time reward them with ascension to the Cabal's inner ranks, and with it, the terrible insight of the threat posed by the Hereticus Tenebrae.

Taking this Alternate Career Rank is not just a matter of passing the xp requirements, it means that you have been singled-out by the Tyrantine Cabal to advance their hideously secretive ambitions. Advancing into this Career makes you a conspirator and subject to the Tyrantine Cabal’s secret orders and goals, and should only be selected if the contrivances of the Tyrant Star figure in to the development of your campaign. As always, consult with your GM and determine whether this Alternate Career Rank is appropriate.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

## **Warp Dabbler**

*"She would have been just a petty recidivist and peddler of harm, one of countless souls of no great worth, but then the warp found her, and she became a true monster. However, as she is a monster loyal to me, you and I are now in conflict."*

— Radical Inquisitor Soldevan to Judge Hiram Fulk of the Adeptus Arbites
##### **Background**
Warp Dabblers, sometimes referred to as warplocks and petty sorcerers, are individuals tampering—often quite nesciently—with the malignant arts of the warp sorcery. Whether cultists, noncompliants, recidivists, or amoral academics, these individuals have had contact with forbidden knowledge and have decided to further explore the possibilities it can offer. These are not true sorcerers or savants of the forbidden, but instead are dark-hearted warriors, soiled enforcers, spiteful adepts, and twisted killers who have acquired a degree of warp lore and have made the perilous decision to put it into use for their own gain. Although they may never achieve the terrible heights of occult power and knowledge that the true masters of sorcery can, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing—especially in the hands of often-desperate individuals on the fringes of society.

Warp Dabblers may have walked almost any path before they begin their dalliance with warp craft. In the case of recidivists and other minor heretics, they may be cultists, criminals, smugglers, or even gang bosses. Others could, at least nominally, be on the straight and narrow, including lesser academics, occultists, and even noble scions. The intelligence and strength of will to study the forbidden is not something that all can do, but should one with the potential be presented with tantalisingly proscribed power, he will often seize it and put it to imaginative (and horrible) use.

Blessedly, the sorts of fell knowledge that could start one down the path of the Warp Dabbler are not easy to obtain. The Imperium is, in general, an insular and ignorant society, and this is just as much by design as it is by cultural norms. The Ecclesiarchy constantly preaches rhetoric designed to inspire dogmatic obedience and abject abhorrence of the heretical and the unknown in equal measure, while the Imperial Inquisition considers censoring and limiting the spread of information considered dangerous or corrupting an absolutely vital task. To the average Imperial citizen, a formal education in academic subjects is a luxury, daemons are distant horrors portrayed in morality plays, and the warp is more of an abstraction of antipathetic feelings than a very real place of unadulterated power and anarchy.

In this social climate, it is onerous to say the least to obtain texts or information about daemonology, the occult, and the immaterium, but it is by no means impossible either. There are few things more consistent in human nature than the desire to possess that which is proscribed or
unobtainable. In the darkest corners of Imperial society—and often its loftiest heights too—banned texts, forbidden tomes, and other instructions in warp craft can be bought, traded, and stolen by someone with the right connections or resources. Tragically, some even find their way into the hands of completely unwitting souls who, in a moment of weakness, turn away from the Ecclesiarchy's blessed ignorance and furtively turn the pages of madness and damnation.

It is an unfortunate irony that the Imperium’s tireless efforts to suppress perilous malefic knowledge mean those who do manage to obtain such information often have little real understanding of just how dangerous it can be. To them, the rituals and incantations are just another tool to obtain their goals, or worse, an amusing frivolity with the supernatural bearing no great significance at all. Only when it is far, far too late, and the leering eyes and grinning mouths of thirsting gods are upon him, does the average Warp Dabbler realise how profoundly his actions have doomed him.

This is not to say, however, that Warp Dabblers are not formidable foes. On the contrary, those who survive long enough, avoiding detection by the Imperial authorities and destruction or insanity from the dread tomes they ply, often possess a combination of low cunning, resourcefulness, and ruthless connivance which makes them quite competent adversaries. In addition, the warp-fueled powers and daemonic allies they can draw on makes them even more dangerous, especially when cornered or desperate. Warp Dabbling crime bosses may take down their rivals with horrors summoned from the warp, while assassins may use sorcery to pass unseen and so eliminate the most heavily guarded of targets with ease. Cultists may attract their followers with forbidden pleasures and dark rewards, while protecting their secrecy with hexes and malefic curses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Warp Dabbler is thus a common quarry for servants of the Inquisition, a burgeoning moral threat who grows in power and danger every day he's left to further hone his hideous craft.

For Inquisitors of a more radical persuasion, cornering a Warp Dabbler who isn't already "too far gone" could be a profitable prospect. A Warp Dabbling Acolyte can call on his knowledge of the dark arts to defeat his opponents, gain a better understanding of their motives and operations, or even bend the powers of the warp against its own vile denizens when they manifest in the materium. When facing the prospect of execution, or worse, few Warp Dabblers would reject a radical Inquisitor's sanction to make something worthwhile of their lives, and with it, perhaps earn redemption in the eyes of the God-Emperor.
### **Becoming a Warp Dabbler**
An Acolyte requires both motive and opportunity to become a Warp Dabbler. At a minimum, the Acolyte must have a source from which he could acquire profane knowledge of the warp, along with the necessary moral flexibility to heedlessly study such subjects and their dire portents. The Acolyte’s Inquisitor might be a source of such possibility, as could contact with warp cults or forbidden tomes, perhaps made during the course of an investigation. Once the Acolyte chooses to dabble in the proscribed, he must spend an amount of time studying or being tutored—usually taking a few months, although a fast reader could conceivably do it quicker—during which time the Acolyte gains 2d10 Corruption Points.

Note that this Alternate Career Rank is intended to represent a more surface-level or casual understanding of the malignancy that is the warp. For Acolytes partaking in true academic study of the immaterium and what lies within, see the [Malefic Scholar](alternate%20career%20ranks.md#malefic%20scholar) Alternate Career Rank.

## **Xeno-Arcanist**

*“Yes, you were quite right to call me in, Lord Marshal. The runic symbols are indeed of xenos origin, yes, the dying ones it appears… but the inscription is not in their usual form… this rune here, for example, does indicate a warning, but not against trespass as one might expect but… oh… I say…. ahem, I must consult some texts, erm, off world, very important—if my passage could be arranged quickly? Preferably now?”*

— Xeno-Arcanist Xoth Lyncarte, partial recording found during search for lost expedition to Seedworld Gamma-9
### **Background**
A specialised scholar in both a privileged and a dangerous position, a Xeno-Arcanist specialises in obscure lore and knowledge concerning the works of the alien. While there is no shortage of superstition and sophism regarding those that dwell from beyond the stars, reliable sources for such knowledge are rare. Among them are the Rogue Trader dynasties, the Explorators of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and the annals of Imperial History itself, which are rife with stories of war against the aliens that have surrounded and beset mankind since the ancient Age of Terra. The most exhaustive (and prohibited) records, however, reside in the archives of the Holy Inquisition itself, courtesy of the its intrepid members of the Ordo Xenos. These contain a veritable treasure trove of terrible knowledge and perilous artefacts from alien races known, unknown, and in some cases, deemed to be so dangerous that even use of their names is forbidden on pain of death. Such a vast wealth of fragmentary, disparate, and often contradictory knowledge requires both skill and vast insight to organise and apply. For this reason, Xeno-Arcanist Acolytes are considered a vital asset by their masters in the Ordo Xenos, although most are the subject of close scrutiny and surveillance as the foul temptation of the alien can be a powerful lure. Some serve as cloistered academics and savants, while others are utilised as agents in the field, putting their skills to use to protect and advise their peers when interaction (and often conflict) with the alien is likely.

Outside the Holy Ordos, the Xeno-Arcanist holds a far more precarious position, and the vast majority must often conceal their knowledge to avoid persecution. Many are driven academics whose lust for knowledge outstrips any misgivings about the inherently treacherous nature of the alien. Others, true Emperor-fearing citizens of His realm, believe that by studying the alien they can better learn to defeat it. The more amoral and wicked amongst them seek to replicate alien technology and achievements for their own ends, and the truly depraved even seek out congress with such entities for all matters of vile purposes. Often blinded by the potential discoveries and benefits involved, it is a regrettably all-too-common blunder for the Xeno-Arcanist to secretly disbelieve the well-established Imperial doctrine that the xenos and their works are fundamentally evil and are to be shunned. The truly unfortunate among them live long enough to regret this misplaced conceit as they are consumed by the alien's machinations.

The Calixis Sector, bounded as it is by the vast and terrifying expanse of unknown space, is a place where knowledge of the alien is in high (even if secret) demand, with many mercantile guilds, explorers, and even noble houses, quietly circumventing the Imperium’s ban on such knowledge either through desire for profit, power, out of fear, or just simple, damnable curiosity. The unavoidable fact that many worlds in Calixis were all but infested with xenos only a few short millennia ago has greatly contributed to the number and sheer diversity of these heathen artefacts, much to the chagrin of Ordo Xenos. By simple virtue of the sector’s location, time, and exposure, many private libraries and collections on Scintilla, Malfi, and other leading worlds of the Sector are known to hold their own xenos relics and secret lore. The largest single collection in "private hands", the vast assemblage of the Hetaireia Lexis, has been the source of several scandals involving xenos tools and weapons in the past, prompting a few armed raids and a great amount of bureaucratic teeth-gnashing. In this very profitable, if treacherous, environment, a rogue Xeno-Arcanist can charge a high price for their expertise if they are willing to enter such a dangerous game. Most do so with their own agendas, from pursuit of wealth, to esoteric interest in the nature of the alien and its works, to even something as pure as love of the scholar's trade. These so-called "independent" lore-traders would be well cautioned to consider what motives their employers may have to acquire such perilous knowledge.
### **Becoming a Xeno-Arcanist**
Becoming a Xeno-Arcanist is more a matter of inclination and opportunity than anything else. Conceivably any Adept in the service of the Inquisition could be tasked or driven to study the alien, particularly if, in the past, they have encountered the xenos themselves or acted as curator for xeno-lore or artefacts. This is particularly the case of Adepts in the service of Inquisitors from Ordo Xenos, for whom the pursuit of the alien and the destruction of those who have truck with their works is their central quest.

Less commonly, a Xeno-Arcanist practising their own trade might find themselves impressed into an Inquisitor's service—possibly unwillingly. When an exigent circumstance demands critical insight into the nature of an alien threat, an Inquisitor who cannot pursue such knowledge through the normal channels might seek out a Xeno-Arcanist's services, forcibly if necessary. If the Inquisitor happens to be a radical, they might even be inclined to press-gang a Xeno-Arcanist into their retinue, especially if the waylaid scholar has been less than pious and moral in their dealings.

## **Verispex Adept**

*“There is here such a wealth of evidence that the perpetrator has all but signed his name to the crime. One needs only the proper knowledge and tools to find it. Your culprit will be named presently.”*

— Verispex Adept Kilvarek at a murder scene on Vaxanide
### **Background**
There are times when a precinct fort needs more than a heavy hand and a riot shield to bring well-heeled and resourceful suspects to justice. There are times when the Adeptus Arbites must find an elusive criminal before they can arrest him. Indeed, there are times when the actual hand behind a crime is so far removed from the act itself that only the barest of clues can connect the two. In circumstances like these, the leads are often all but invisible to even the most highly trained lawgiver. It falls to an entirely different sort of operative to not only find these clues, but to analyse them and wring from them what information they have to offer.

The Verispex Adept, an all-too-rare occurrence of institutional collaboration between the Adeptus Arbites and the Inquisition's Calixian Conclave, is the human tool deployed as an answer to these questions. Originally devised during the first purging of House Thrungg, the Verispex came to be to track down fantastically wealthy members of the fallen noble family whose vast resources and connections within Scintilla's upper echelons allowed them to evade judgement for decades. The fugitive nobles proved especially elusive to typical methods of tracking, and the demands of justice required the cultivation of new arts of detection. The Verispex Adept uses his own immense knowledge, both learned and implanted, to follow the minute traces of physical evidence left by even the most careful suspect, analyse the brief glimpses of emplaced auspex scanners and detection servitors to establish patterns of movement, and pick out the subtle "tells" of an off-world criminal blending in with the native population where they've gone to ground.

The path of a Verispex begins much earlier than that of a typical Adept, often during the first two decades of life. This is due to the extensive, multi-disciplinary education the specialised program requires of its Verispex Adepts. In recent years, Lord Marshal Goreman of the Calixian Arbites has drawn Verispex candidates exclusively from the ranks of the Schola Progenium, diverting its most intelligent candidates from a dour career as an Administratum scroll-pusher to the Verispex program. There, they are trained in identity capture techniques by Arbitrator civil monitors, the customs and mannerisms of citizens of all walks of life by well-travelled Inquisitorial agents, and the ability to sift through technological "footprints" of all matters of scanning apparatuses by tech-adepts skilled in the art of surveillance. The exhaustive level of minutia and the sheer breadth of skills that the Verispex must commit to memory take many years to collect and catalogue, and only the most prodigious candidates are likely to see their first true case before their fourth decade. The amount of time, material, and man-hour expenditure needed to train even one Verispex Adept is monstrous, and in order to preserve such investments a Verispex is usually kept as far from the front lines of Imperial lawkeeping as possible. When circumstances demand a Verispex Adept be present in a combat situation they are carefully guarded, and there are more than a few instances of Arbitrators literally taking a bullet meant for their Verispex.

The sort of trivium which Verispex are routinely called upon to examine requires an incredibly powerful mind, further sharpened by years of focused training, to process. Already often the most intelligent and well educated soul in a Judge's cadre of retainers or Inquisitor's retinue of Throne Agents, many Verispex Adepts receive cortex implants and augmetic cogitation engines to aid them in their work. Scanners, pict-recorders, matriculation engines, and chemical and metaphysical analysis arrays are all familiar tools of the Verispex Adept. As well, the banks of cogitators and legions of technical servitors at the disposal of the Verispex corps are enormous on a scale rarely seen outside the Adeptus Mechanicus. In truth, the Mechanicus is a largely unseen third pillar behind the creation of the Verispex, and the ties between their creation and the Martian Priesthood are many and varied. The technical skills required to become a Verispex Adept are sometimes considered borderline heretical, and would almost certainly violate the spirit of the Mechanicus' longstanding Law of the Divine Complexity, if not its exact letter. Not only that, material support for the training of each Verispex, along with diligent maintenance of the infrastructure that supports them, is unofficiously provided by the Mechanicus as well. Only a fool, however, would assume the Priests of Mars would offer such largess and indulgence without extracting something of comparable value for themselves. In exchange for this assistance, the Adeptus Mechanicus have secured a binding accord between the Calixian Arbites and Inquisition—no Verispex Adept may so much as set foot within a Mechanicus enclave or on any forge world within the Sector. The Martian Priests still guard their secrets jealously, and while willing to assist in the creation of one of the finest sleuthing and tracking constructs yet devised, they also did so only with the certainty that the Verispex could never be used against them.
### **Becoming a Verispex Adept**
The skills required to stand among the forensic experts of the Inquisition are both extensive and specific, and demands lengthy education in the libraries of the Tricorn Palace. The vast majority of those who become Verispex Adepts begin their career at an extremely young age, and more mature aspirants would be well past their prime by the time their training was complete. After a relatively brief span of years, the recruits are given a speciality based on their performance and accomplishment. These hopeful adepts are assigned to a senior Verispex Adept sharing their specialisation for a lengthy apprenticeship in which their knowledge of esoterica and minutia is increased to superhuman proportions. After this apprenticeship, which can last anywhere from several years to decades, the Adept is finally sent into the information cataloguing halls of the
Tricorn Palace, or for those who've demonstrated a true knack for field work, into the service of an Inquisitor to begin their holy work of finding those who wish not to be found.

**Required Career:** Adept
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0xp)
**Other Requirements:** This Alternate Career Rank must be chosen during character creation—the very long training process, taking several years for even the most adroit Acolytes, makes becoming a Verispex Adept in the midst of a campaign an unrealistic prospect.
