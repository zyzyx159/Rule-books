*"The fires through which we pass in this life are but the light of the Emperor's forge. Our triumphs and tragedies are the heat by which we are tempered into weapons fit for his service."*

This chapter trains its attention on **Dark Heresy**'s Career Path system by expanding your options to offer more flexibility and individualisation through the use of Alternate Career Ranks. As the name suggests, these Ranks that may be taken during your character's career progression as alternatives to the normal path of their Career. In many ways these Alternate Ranks change your character's potential abilities and direction but not their fundamental nature: you won't swap Career Paths, but rather your character's fate simply takes an unusual detour along the way.

These Alternate Career Ranks serve two functions: the first is to offer you an opportunity to personalise your character and make him or her something unique and special. The second is to give characters a very definite place within the setting, a role amongst the powers and intrigues of the Calixis Sector. As the astute among you will notice, most of the Alternate Ranks are firmly grounded in a particular conspiracy, organisation, or cult, giving your character a clearly definable anchor to the society of the 41st Millennium beyond their service to the Inquisition.

Although these options do offer exciting choices and provide impetus for great role playing, many carry serious consequences and/or expectations over how your character will conduct themselves. As with any new material, be sure to consult with your GM and gain their approval before you invest in one of these options.
## **Taking an Alternate Rank**

Alternate Ranks are an attractive option and for good reason. Gaining new abilities, Skills and Talents, and giving you more tools to distinguish your character from others of your path are all excellent reasons for acquiring an Alternate Rank. To select an Alternate Rank, you must first secure your GM's permission. Several of the Alternate Ranks may complicate matters and be at odds with an existing plot line or campaign. Second, most Alternate Ranks include one or more prerequisites, which you must fulfil before taking the Rank. Finally, Alternate Ranks have a minimum Career Rank at which they can be taken by the character. The Rank can be taken at this minimum Rank, or at any Rank thereafter. Some Alternate Ranks are limited to a single Career Path, while others can be taken by many.

Once you've met all of the requirements, and your GM agrees, you may select the Alternate Rank. In every case, the Alternate Rank is "swapped" for the Rank you would otherwise have taken and its Advance Scheme is exchanged for the one found in your Career's normal path. From this point onward, you have access to these Advances and may spend your xp freely on them. The Rank may also indicate some unique ability or Trait that is gained as well—apply these immediately. 

You must select an Alternate Rank before you purchase any other Advances for the standard Rank you would ordinarily enter. If you purchase any Advances from your normal Career Advances for that Rank you must wait until the next Rank before you can select the Alternate Rank.

Because taking an Alternate Rank complicates the character progression system somewhat, it is recommended for experienced players. Remember, though, that regardless of how many options you have, a finite number of xp caps your progress, and this is what determines your character's total Rank.
##### **Example**
*Junt Yeager, a Guardsman character takes the Alternate Rank Malfian Bloodsworn, exchanging his usual Rank 5: Veteran for Rank 5: Bloodsworn, and fulfils the requirements listed. He doesn't cease to be a Guardsman; he is just now a Guardsman who sidelines as a murderous bounty hunter. Junt's player now has access to the Skills and Talents listed under the Bloodsworn Advances at the costs listed there, and may spend xp freely on them from this point forward. However, all this time gallivanting around bringing down recidivists for money means he misses out on certain opportunities from Guardsmen Rank 5: Veteran. When he moves onto Guardsman Rank: 6, if he wishes to still obtain these (and has the xp to spend), he must pay for them as Elite Advances.*
#### **Elite Advances for Missed Career Ranks**

As well as offering up a slew of new abilities and potentials, taking an Alternate Rank, "the path less travelled" so to speak, has its downsides. You may (and likely will) miss out on certain Skills and Talents, have your maximum ability with certain Skills capped-out early, or be forced to pay more xp for them. This is simply the price of diversifying your character into a new and specialised area. Your GM may allow you to still pick these missed Advancements, if appropriate, but as Elite Advances during your next Career Rank.

Having taken an Alternate Rank means that your character has deviated from the regular path and, while the character will have gained new and often unique abilities from this extra-curricular activity, he misses out on what would have been his regular development. With the GM's approval, the "missed" Talents and Skills can be obtained by the character as Elite Advances for their listed cost in the missed Rank, plus 50 xp.
##### **Example**
*Junt the Guardsman missed out on Guardsman Rank 5: Veteran, having become a Bloodsworn bounty hunter instead. However, Junt obtained a melta gun during the course of an encounter with some hereteks and would like to become proficient in its use. Basic Weapon Training (Melta) is an Advance listed on his missing Rank, so Junt's player asks to take this as an Elite Advance. The GM agrees, on the condition that the character spends sufficient downtime between adventures practising, and allows Junt to have the Advance for 150 xp (100 for the Talent plus 50 more for the Elite Advance). The GM also charges him a chunk of Throne gelt for the cost of the ammo bottles he's used up training with the hand-cooker.*
#### **Skill Mastery**

You may observe that some Alternate Career Ranks include Skills that you already possess or can otherwise purchase from your normal Career Advances. This is not an oversight—in some cases, you may be able to purchase a Skill at a lower xp cost through an Alternate Rank than from your regular Career Advances. Furthermore, should you gain the same Skill twice—for example, if you have already purchased a Skill from your Career Advance, and find it available for purchase again in an Alternate Career Rank—you instead gain the [Talented](talents.md#talented) Talent for that Skill.
### **Moving On**

Once you have accumulated and spent enough xp to advance to the next Rank, you do so as normal. If your Career Path splits, you must choose one path as you normally would, your Alternate Rank standing in the stead of any previous choice you needed to have made. You must then follow this chosen path normally, although you may find your "tangent" has left you missing certain Skills needed as prerequisites for some of the Advances offered by the new Rank and, to acquire them, you must obtain them as Elite Advances (see above). More likely, however, you will continue to develop your Advances from your Alternate Rank to make up for missed opportunities.
## **Alternate Career Rank Descriptions**

The Alternate Ranks described herein are divided into individual sections for each Career Path. Locate your Career, then review the Alternate Ranks listed below to determine if one is suitable to your interests. 

Some Advances in the Alternate Rank Advance Table are **bolded**. This indicates a "unique" Advance which is not available to most, or possibly any, other Careers. Such unique advances are described within the Alternate Career Rank Description directly below the Advance Table.

Note that while these Career Path requirements are normally binding, your GM may allow you to select an Alternate Rank even if your character belongs to a different Path if you can make a compelling argument for why your character should be able to do so. 
##### **Example**
*Morden the Guardsman would ordinarily not be allowed to become a Metallican Gunslinger, as this Alternate Rank has a Required Career of Assassin or Scum. Morden is particularly adroit with pistols, however, and has learned the masters of the quick draw largely hail from Gunmetal City. Morden's player asks the GM if Morden could become a Metallican Gunslinger at his next Rank. The GM agrees, under the condition that Morden spend a good amount of time between investigations prowling the Infernis as a gun-for-hire, thus giving him reasonable opportunities to learn from Scintilla's master pistoleros. Morden is then allowed to substitute Rank 3: Armsman for Metallican Gunslinger, and thus the legend of a new Knave of Pistols began.*
