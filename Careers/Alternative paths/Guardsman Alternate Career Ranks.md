## **Agent of Reliquary 26**

*“Ours is not an easy task. We gather those most important relics, those symbols of the culture of Mankind. We dare the darkness and travel across the stars clinging to rumour and legend as our guide.”*

— Marcius Dans, Agent of Reliquary 26
### **Background**
Entombed more than a hundred metres beneath the Inquisition's majestic if imposing Tricorn Palace is the Grand Reliquarium, a series of vaults that are home to many artefacts and powerful relics of the Calixis Sector. In these hallowed halls rest hundreds of items of power, from crafted trinkets of the Dark Age of Technology to the blessed weapons of venerable martyrs or even saints. Each of these vaults, of which reliable sources claim there at at least one hundred, are heavily guarded, monitored, and tended to by the Custodiatrix, a small organisation of curator-assassins, each charged with the safety of the artefacts and assigned to one of the vaults. Reliquary 26 contains the relics of the Scholariate at Arms.

In addition to housing artefacts, Reliquary 26 also employs a great number of Agents, men and women who scour the Calixian worlds in search of more items of renown to add to the vaunted collection. Whether through negotiation, deception, or violence, the goal of these Agents is a simple one: ensure the safety and survival of the relics of Man. To do so, they must first identify such items of power, decide whether or not the current ownership is valid, and reclaim the item in question, by force if necessary. Often, Agents act alone or in pairs, though it is not uncommon for an entire cadre of mercenaries to be hired if an acquisition proves particularly difficult. It is rumoured that that the Scholariate at Arms once hired an entire house of assassins to reclaim a relic from the blessed armour of Saint Drusus, though the veracity of such a rumour could never be proven.

As one might expect, Agents of Reliquary 26 are very well outfitted. Although they are relatively unknown as an organisation, members often find themselves at odds with Calixian nobles, Ecclesastical prelates, Rogue Traders, and mercantile magnates—individuals who often value their possessions and do not wish to part with them simply because the Inquisition asks nicely. As a result, many Agents have at least one or two enemies in the upper echelons of Imperial society. Though the agency does attempt to reimburse the owners of the relics they acquire, it is not uncommon for them to have to pry the artefact in question from the lifeless fingers of some greedy soul that simply couldn't part with it for any amount of compensation.

Reliquary 26 works quite closely with the larger Ordos of the Inquisition. Often, Inquisitors find themselves with items of interest left over from an investigation. In exchange for the safe return of any relics or artefacts found by an Inquisitor in the course of his duties, Reliquary 26 will often return the favour by loaning out an item of great power. Many Inquisitors are quite content to employ Agents of Reliquary 26 in their Acolyte cells, profiting from the Agents' access to rare and often powerful devices while maintaining a mutually-beneficial relationship with the Custodiatrix. 
### **Becoming an Agent of Reliquary 26**
An experienced servant of Reliquary 26 is an indispensable resource to an Acolyte cell. When dealing with nobility or other well-to-do types, or in areas where ancient or xenos technology may
be encountered, an Inquisitor would be well served by requisitioning an Agent of Reliquary 26's services. Such Agents usually only serve the Inquisitor the duration of the investigation at hand. Inquisitors who must regularly navigate such treacherous situations have been known to second a trusted Acolyte to the Custodiatrix to be trained in their ways, effectively gaining a permanent "representative" to Reliquary 26's hallowed armoury. As the point of contact between the Grand Reliquarium and the often covetous owners of the sought-after artefacts, most Agents become quite adept at negotiation and tradecraft. Such skills can be invaluable to an Acolyte cell, especially in situations where a hostile acquisition could be more troublesome than normal.

**Required Career:** Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Must have acquired one item of Near Unique Availability or rarer, and turned it over to his Inquisitor or directly to the Grand Reliquarium.
**Aggrieved Parties:** Even if the character has not personally wronged them, at least one group of well-heeled individuals gravely dislikes Reliquary 26. The character gains the [Rival (Ecclesiarchy), (Nobility), or (Rogue Trader)](talents.md#rival) Talent at the GM's discretion.
**Reliquary Loan:** The Grand Reliquarium has resources that include ancient and exotic equipment that is sometimes entrusted to Acolytes serving an Inquisitor. At the beginning of each mission the character gains one valuable item determined by the GM. Unless the character receives some special dispensation, the item must be returned after the mission, with grave consequences for those who try to deprive the Reliquarium of their property. The GM should choose an item that they feel is appropriate to the Acolyte's mission.

## **Chaliced Commissariat Operative**

*“You may owe your soul to the God-Emperor, soldier, but look at the printing on the housing of that lasgun. See where it says 'Hax-Orthlack'? Lord Hax owns you. He owns your planet. He owns this planet. That means you owe your loyalty to him. Understand? If I hear so much as the faintest whisper that evens hints at sedition again I'll have you hung from that vox aerial so fast you won't even realise your neck's broke.”*

— Chaliced Commissar Tetra Irbil
### **Background**
Those who move close to those circles of power at the Lucid Palace on Scintilla, or with enough resource to pay to hear the talk of the court, know that Lord Sector Marius Hax is a savagely ambitious and covetous individual. His determination to maintain the glorious and obedient dominion of the Emperor in the Calixis Sector—under the banner of House Hax, of course—is worth to him any bloodshed or terror. He despises rebels with a malice and hatred that most reserve for marauding xenos. Hax has spent considerable time and efforts forging many tools to tighten his grip on the sector, a subtle but firm warning to the envy and ambitions of the other great houses of Calixis. Of these tools, the most outwardly visible, and easily the most controversial, is the Chaliced Commissariat.

This special military unit is a direct political and military extension of the Lord Sector's will, and was created to ensure locally raised Imperial Guard regiments as well as standing Planetary Defence Forces remained loyal to House Hax. Although there are a great many ways rebellion could break out, Hax believes the potential of corruption or disloyalty among its military forces is both the most likely to occur, and the most likely to succeed. The Imperium's history is littered with such revolts, and Hax is absolutely unwilling to risk continued Imperial governance in Calixis, or his personal reputation for that matter, be threatened by such an event. To this end, as part of House Hax's consolidation of political control in Calixis, he commissioned the raising of a special military formation modelled after the Officio Prefectus of the Departmento Munitorum, but which would answer to him and him alone. 

Hax's Chaliced Commissariat draws suitable recruits from across the sector, individually selected for their loyalty, ambition, and ruthlessness. To wear the laurel-wreathed chalice badge and deep red rank insignia is an affirmation of one's absolute dedication to the Lord Sector and willingness to use any means necessary to ensure order and stamp out the embers of sedition before they can come aflame. A Chaliced Commissar is charged with maintaining the morale and loyalty of a given military force, rooting out criminality and corruption, especially those where it is suspected that a force might be falling under undue influence from other authorities—Hax's rivals among the other great houses of Calixis being the most dire. Whatever plays local or sector-wide powers might make, the Chaliced Commissariat ensures that fear of retribution will overcome them in the hearts of the soldiers.

Such "internal security" agencies are not unheard of in the Imperium, particularly on massive hive worlds where a PDF could number millions of men at arms at once, but the powers, remit, and sheer brutality of Hax's force is unusual, and has caused a significant amount of discord among the other noble houses and the offices of the Adepta in Calixis. Feared and hated in equal measure across the sector, the mere sight of the chalice badge is enough cause for a PDF trooper to blanch and consider whether their life is about to come to an end.

Lord Marshal Goreman of the Adeptus Arbites has made no secret of his dislike for Hax's "specially selected scum", seeing them as bordering on an unlawful agency and dangerously close to being an instrument of rebellion themselves. The Calixian Administratum has lodged similar concerns—if, Throne forbid, Hax were to rebel against Imperial authority, he could easily drag numerous planets throughout Calixis with him, their PDFs overthrowing both local authorities and Adepta missions through the blind loyalty that Hax's Chaliced Commissars have demanded of them. House Hax's rivals within the Senatorum Calixis, of which there are many, have also chafed against the unprecedented level of consolidation of authority a single noble house has managed to accumulate. Since as far back as Saint Drusus himself serving as the first Lord Sector the natural competitive interests of the Great Houses has served as a constraint against any one of them becoming "too powerful" in the eyes of their peers, with the house of the Lord Sector effectively functioning as a first among equals. Hax has confidently cast off this informal tradition, and the Chaliced Commissariat serves as a powerful check against any of the other houses thinking they might utilise the PDFs of worlds they control in any effort to oust Hax from the Lucid Palace.

The harshest criticism, however, has come from the "true" Commissariat, the Officio Prefectus of the Departmento Munitorum. The distrust of this arm of the Adepta was never concealed, but it blossomed into outright conflict during the Tranch Insurrection, and the consequences of that crisis have reverberated throughout the sector. Pushed back by a mob of Pale Throng cultists led by a cadre of renegade psykers, an Imperial Guard company of Maccabean Janissaries was put to death to a man by a unit of especially zealous Chaliced Commissariat operatives—including their Regimental Commissar. The outrage over such a overreach of authority led to swift and vicious retribution. The Senior Commissar overseeing all loyalist forces on Tranch declared the Chaliced Commisariat's actions an act of traitorous mass-murder against the Emperor's lawful men at arms. The only acceptable punishment was execution, and the vengeful Guard and PDF regulars were all too eager to assist in carrying out this pronouncement. A week later, every Chaliced Commissar and their auxiliary operatives on Tranch were dead, their corpses disparagingly thrown in with the mass graves of mutants and rebels in a final act of disgrace.

Since the so-called "Tranch Affair" the Chaliced Commissariat's star has significantly dimmed. Publicly, the Lord Sector accepted no blame for the incident, decreeing it to be an unfortunate misunderstanding from which the guilty had already been punished. Behind closed doors, however, the censure was swift and furious. The Imperial Guard's Segmentum Command on Cadia issued a formal rebuke, proscribing the Chaliced Commissariat from ever attempting to "police" the loyalty of any Imperial Guard or Navy elements again—adding insult to injury, members of the Chaliced Commissariat were also no longer allowed to refer to themselves as "commissars" either, that right reserved exclusively for the Officio Prefectus. Lord Marshal Goreman issued his own admonishment, firmly warning the Lord Sector that if any Chaliced Commissariat operative dared to harm a force of Arbitrators in any way, Goreman would personally have Hax himself arrested and prosecuted for sedition.

Although the Imperium's harsh reprimand was made in secret, the walls of the Lucid Palace have ears, and word of the affair has flowed freely in the halls of House Hax's rivals in the Senatorum Calixis. Taking advantage of the confusion and the forcible stand-down order, the powers of the Malfian sub-sector worlds either purged or co-opted the Chaliced Commissariat operatives from their PDFs, and the lords of notoriously-independent Fenksworld managed to diminish the Commissariat's presence there to an insignificant figurehead. Now reduced mainly to House Hax's traditional power base in the Golgenna Reach, the remains of the Chaliced Commissariat are largely limited to conducting "policing actions" against Hax's political enemies and rivals. While the operatives are now a mere shadow of their former selves, they still hold considerable power over the PDFs on Scintilla, Bront, Luggnum, and other worlds under House Hax's influence. For the time being, at least, Marius Hax's rule appears to be secure.
### **Becoming a Chaliced Commissariat Operative**
Members of the Chaliced Commissariat are not only soldiers, but ruthless figures of authority and fear within the Calixis Sector, although their power outside the core worlds surrounding Scintilla is far weaker than it once was. This alone may make the recruitment of a Commissariat operative attractive to an Inquisitor in need of a ruthless military-trained Acolyte. Members of the Commissariat also move freely around the Sector in the execution of their duties, and have access to intelligence sources regarding political and military matters, making them excellently placed to act as hidden agents of the Inquisition. In their current state of decline, many Chaliced Commissariat operatives might find the prospect of working for an entirely more powerful authority to be a tempting one.

Within the Inquisition there are many who share Lord Marshal Goreman's extreme distaste for the implications of the Chaliced Commissariat, although they have never publicly intimated as such. Having an Acolyte placed within an extension of Hax's power base would be an obvious boon for Inquisitors who harbour suspicions about the Lord Sector or his inner circle.

A character who becomes part of the Chaliced Commissariat automatically gains the **Feared and Loathed Trait**.

**Required Career:** Guardsman
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp)
#### **Trait: Feared and Loathed**
Members of the Chaliced Commissariat act with a brutal autonomy thanks to the indulgence of Lord Sector Hax. Their elimination of seditious elements within PDF units and pitiless reputation means that members of PDFs or Imperial Guard regiments raised within Calixis are liable to respond with fear and deep-seated loathing to a member of the Chaliced Commissariat.

If you are clearly identified as a member of this organisation, such as by bearing the Chaliced Commissariat's badge, you gain a +10 bonus on [Inquiry](skills.md#inquiry) and [Intimidate](skills.md#intimidate) Tests when used against members of the Imperial Guard or PDFs. You take a –10 penalty, however, when Testing [Charm](skills.md#charm) or [Command](skills.md#command) on the same groups.

**Note:** This Trait depends as much on the uniform, manner, and bearing as anything else, and if the character is otherwise dressed, unrecognised or disguised its effects do not apply. Likewise, its effects may be reduced or completely ignored on worlds where the Chaliced Commissariat's authority is not recognised.

## **Chastener**

*"Who can truly return to the grace of the God-Emperor without the searing pain which accompanies having one's sin revealed in His just light? This modest brand I have here is but a small thing by comparison, but the pain you feel should serve as a sufficient representation. Now, kindly hold still..."*

— Marcus Danturian, Chastener of The Pendulum
### **Background**
To be gunned down in the street, cornered by a squad of black-armoured Arbitrators or green-clad Magistratum enforcers, is a common (and usually deserved) end for those who have threatened the stability and constancy of Imperial society. Not all crimes warrant death, however, and those who show some contrition, a chance at rehabilitation, or are just not foolish enough to point a gun at a lawgiver are more than likely to make the acquaintances of a Chastener. It is the duty of the Chasteners to return the body and soul of such criminals to the service of the Emperor, which He so rightly requires. 

The Chastener is a determined hound of a lawman, one that bites viciously but with enough measured restraint to subdue his target without killing them whenever possible. Arbitrator precinct forts and the better-equipped enforcer houses will often feature a specialised simulation room for these men to practice the ways of fighting to subdue and restrain. A Chastener also learns the finer aspects of interrogation, torture, and coercive force, to better extract confessions and provide repentance and absolution to those who would receive it. For those renegades who would prefer a quick and heroic death, going down in a hail of Arbites gunfire to avoid true penance for their crimes, a Chastener determined to take them alive is like a force of nature, standing in defiance of whatever threats the criminal poses to deliver them to their judgement.

Long considered an antiquated and whimsical notion, the forceful rehabilitation of the recidivist and the renegade has returned to the mainstream largely as a result of the influence of Lord Marshal Goreman of the Calixian Arbites. Goreman, more of a pious man of faith than a dispassionate legalist, holds to the notion that each man's first duty is to serve the Emperor in life and deed. To act contrary to the law is to not only disobey this duty, but to spit in the face of everything the Emperor has built and the countless sacrifices He has made to secure Mankind's future. Therefore, in the Lord Marshal's view, it is not the Arbitrators' place to take from the Emperor one who might still serve the purpose for which he was born. Following the lead of their master and patron, the Chasteners seek to return their prey to the straight and narrow rather than execute them right off, with killing reserved only for the most irredeemable or to protect the lives of their fellow lawgivers. If a Chastener succeeds in his task, not only will he have returned a wayward soul to the service of the God-Emperor, for the betterment of all, but he will have also saved the same soul from damnation.

The ways in which crime is punished without resorting to the barbarity of execution are many and varied, but only a few outcomes exist for the criminal. In the eyes of the Chastener, the most desired result is to return the prisoner to Imperial society, well-chastised for his lawless ways and repentant, a good and kind soul remade from the dark and depraved heart it had been before. In many cases, the criminal is often too far gone, their crimes so numerous and repulsive that true clemency is impossible. The Chastener must be perceptive and of sound judgement, able to discern the pleas of mercy from the truly remorseful from the conceit of those merely expressing fear and cowardice. These important distinctions made, the Chastener can then go about his work of absolving the repentant, consigning the recalcitrant to more long-term forms of rehabilitation, and—if necessary—putting to death the absolutely irredeemable. Those who have received absolution return to criminality only very, very rarely, and the Lord Marshal has been quite keen to use such outcomes to validate his positions.

Reaching any of these ends is no easy thing, either for the criminal or his Chastener, for those who have started down the path of impiousness and criminality have already forsaken their duty to Mankind in favour of their own desires and depravities. In order to return a prisoner to the lawful path, the deviant mind must first be broken free of the taint of rebellion, impulsivity, and faithlessness. As each criminal is a unique case, with their own motives and levers, the Chastener must be a master of both physical torture and corporeal punishments as well as psychological readjustment, whichever is most effective for their current charge. Of course, breaking the subject's errant spirit is only the first stage of the process of rehabilitation. Only after they have been reduced to little more than cowering shells of the foolhardy criminals they once were are the prisoners prepared to be reforged by the Chasteners into proper Imperial citizens. This process has been known to take years for some especially heinous villains, a full daily commitment for the Chastener that consumes the entirety of their hours on duty. Those who fully understand the severity of their misdeeds and the gravity of the situation they find themselves in, meanwhile, might only need a few weeks of a Chastener's tender ministrations before they can be paroled back into society.

Of course, the Chastener's job does not start in the interrogation room. Whilst Arbitrators and rank-and-file enforcers are perfectly capable soldiers of the law, their methods are largely martial in nature. When bullets are flying but circumstances demand the miscreant be taken alive, the Chastener has the responsibility of exercising the necessary restraint to capture and detain the ruffians. To improve their chances for a successful arrest (and staying alive in a firefight) Chasteners
receive extensive training in all sorts of subdual weaponry, from shock mauls to stun grenades to grapple-nets, among other esoteric devices of man-catching. Finally, the Chastener must be able to use his own body as a weapon to restrain his prey, for it cannot be guaranteed that the optimal tool for the job is always at hand. Chasteners thus place significant emphasis on bare-handed combat, as sometimes an effective chokehold or strategically placed carapace boot might be the only means the Chastener has of subduing his quarry.

The Chastener's ability to doggedly pursue, detain, and interrogate criminals makes them both valuable agents of Imperial law and attractive prospects for Inquisitors of the Holy Ordos. The same skills used to extract confessions and repentance from criminals are very applicable to breaking the will of heretics and cultists. While more puritanical Inquisitors might view death as the only acceptable punishment for heresy, extracting information from the heretic first is usually still considered a best practice. Many experienced Chasteners have found themselves scooped up by the Inquisition, either by simple conscription or, for the more fanciful and imaginative, appealing to the Chastener's sense of "a higher duty". This propensity is a vindication of training such lawgivers to their task, but also a point of contention for Lord Marshal Goreman and his like-minded confederates, as their most talented men seem to keep getting appropriated by the one authority the Arbites cannot resist.
### **Becoming a Chastener**
Joining the ranks of the Chasteners is as much a choice as joining the cadre of an Inquisitor. While some may strive for the position, most are pushed toward it by their superiors. Many are recruited directly from the ranks of Arbites troopers, but well-regarded planetary enforcers and even informants and bounty hunters have been known to find themselves wearing the Chastener's chained badge. Troopers who have shown natural knack at interrogation and uncommon restraint in the apprehension of criminals are natural candidates for the rank of Chastener. Few chosen deny the position, for while many Arbitrators prefer a more straightforward approach to dealing with criminals, the rank and honour paid to a Chastener is a valuable asset to anyone
wishing to one day command a Precinct of his own. 

Those in charge of putting prospective Chasteners through the training program are encouraged to create tasks that escalate in danger and require ever increasing creativity on the part of the candidate. The time and effort placed into training these individuals makes recruitment a serious
affair, especially considering the potential that they may find themselves serving an entirely more lofty master before the Arbitrator precinct fort or enforcer house has a chance to really make good on their investment.

## **Cult of the Pure Form**

*"The flesh is strong!"*

— Pure Form maxim
### **Background**
Given the intense liturgical "differences" between them, the Ecclesiarchy and the Adeptus Mechanicus have never enjoyed a healthy working relationship within the Calixis Sector. Conflicts between the two organisations tend to be wars of words, though, political battles fought in the capital worlds of the Sector, rather than outright "shooting wars" between men and machines. Nevertheless, there have been several overt conflicts, such as the attack on the Explorator vessel *Omega Inquiry* from an Adepta Sororitas strike force on the far edges of the Halo Stars. There are no official records of the encounter, but the Tricorn contains sealed datavaults hinting at a heretofore undiscovered abhuman strain that the Mechanicus had uncovered far from civilised space, and the Ministorum’s reactions of horror when their spies reported the discovery. Greatly displeasured by the loss of the Explorator coterie, a Mechanicus Secutor cohort laid waste to two outpost convents in retaliation, and was about to escalate further before secretive diplomacy and unnamed offerings negotiated by third parties settled the matter. Such incidents are still rare, but with the gradual rise of a group calling itself the Cult of the Pure Form, this could begin to change.

It is not known exactly who founded the Cult of the Pure Form, but their influence began in the Malfian Sub-Sector in the immediate aftermath of the Malygrisian Heresy. The traitorous Tech- Priest and his followers ravaged numerous worlds with their devastating weaponry, and some began to think that the existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus would lead to another, inevitable war. The followers of this emerging cult feared that this coming doom would scour humankind from the galaxy, leaving only the cold, barely-human flesh and machine hybrids of the Mechanicus domains behind. This twisted line of logic grew quickly until the first major anti-Mechanicum movement of the Calixis Sector’s history began to swell, with loud marches and violent demonstrations.

In an unexpected move, and one that likely came about due to Cult Mechanicus political manoeuvring on Scintilla, the Sector Synod declared the emergent cult apostate. Over the next decades the cult leaders began to disappear, some dying in mysterious accidents while others perished in what were clearly outright assassinations. Some thought that the Inquisition was to blame, and others whispered of the Officio Assassinorum’s involvement, but very few were aware that the secretive Lords Dragon of the Mechancius bore sole responsibility for this early intervention, and that their clandestine methods had managed to stifle the movement before it
could truly become established. For its part, the Calixian Inquisition viewed this suppression as a grievous overstep of the Lords Dragon's authority beyond the realm of the Lathes, and it was made abundantly clear to the Magi that another transgression of that scale would engulf them in a true shadow war they were not liable to win.

After more high-level negotiation, the Lords Dragon agreed to cease their campaign of suppression, handing over all information they had gathered on the new sect for the Inquisition to process as it saw fit. While the watchers of the Panopticon hoped that the Inquisition would continue their work in stamping out the Cult of the Pure Form, the Conclave determined it was largely harmless to the broader Imperium, and contented themselves to merely monitoring its activities for emergent signs of heresy.

With the bionic boot of the Lords Dragon permanently removed from its figurative throat, the Cult of the Pure Form rose once again, finding succour and eager supporters anywhere common men took umbrage to the Mechanicus' abuses or superstitious fear of its unknowable rites. This time, however, a new generation of cult leaders threw out its previous methods in favour of a slower approach, and rather than attempting to whip the people of a single sub-sector into a frenzy, they would instead choose to let their hatred for the Mechanicus gradually simmer on worlds across the entire Sector.

A second blow came in the form of Ignato Borja, the new Arch-Cardinal of the Sector Synod. Under Ignato's stewardship the Ecclesiarchy curiously refrained denouncing the reformed Cult of the Pure Form. Indeed, Mechanicus spies close to the Ministorum's prelates reported that, at least unofficially, the Ecclesiarchy was quite content to allow the reach of the Pure Form cultists to grow, seeing any harm it might cause the Mechanicus as a potential gain for themselves. Even the Inquisition would be of no aid—initially suspicious of the Pure Form's return to prominence, many of the more puritanical Inquisitors who looked into the cult's ways began to see them in a positive light, emulating agreeable philosophies about the sanctity of the human body and acting as valuable check against the Mechanicus' own clandestine efforts.

Their mechadendrites tied, the Lords Dragon have been forced to passively observe as the Cult of Pure Form rose to prominence once more. Like clockwork, any egregious display of the Mechanicus' power beyond its forge worlds—an Explorator press-gang crew riving through starport public houses, or servitor-artisans systemically scooping up dregs in a hab-vault—is likely to be followed up by an agitator from the Pure Form arriving to preach about the sin and hubris of the Martian Priesthood.

As a matter of liturgy, the Cult of the Pure Form’s members—most of them, anyway—do not hate the Adeptus Mechanicus purely for their worship of the Omnissiah, and neither are they explicitly anti-technology. They simply wish to wrest control of such power away from the Mechanicus, proffering the provincial view that “uncorrupted” humans might control it instead. Their true ire stems from the extensive use of cybernetics and other mechanical implants that virtually every member of the Adeptus Mechanicus possesses. To the cult, the most pure form in the universe is that of the human body, an image of the God-Emperor Himself, and to defile it by removing untainted flesh and grafting on artificial limbs and organs is blasphemy in its own right.

Quite a few members of the Cult of the Pure Form have cybernetic implants when they join. These souls are often spurred on by dissatisfaction with low quality or cheap implants, or suffer a form of "cyberpsychosis" where they cannot perceive their augments as part of their own body and come to loathe their presence. These cultists undergo a ritual known as the Purity of Flesh to remove the implants from their bodies. 

This ritual often leaves the participant missing limbs or eyes, and can rob them of their ability to hear or even speak. Known as the “Shriven” by other Pure Form cultists, these blessed men and women are highly regarded, having seen the purity of the human body as it was meant to be and unshackling themselves from the augmetic prisons of the Mechanicus. Most will choose to replace their removed cybernetics with strictly fleshy equivalents, often vat-grown examples cultivated for the individual Shriven in question, although some are forced to make do with biomatter reclaimed and purified from servitors or harvested from executed criminals. Especially pious cultists have been known to reject even this, however, getting by with purely inert prostheses and simply accepting the loss of ability that comes from a missing body part as an intractable and, indeed, necessary aspect of the human condition.

The bulk of the cult’s ranks, however, are made up of those fortunate enough to have lived without the defilement of cybernetics, and are referred to as the “Untouched.” Each Untouched member comes to the sect for different reasons, but most are spurred on by a love of the God-Emperor as a human paragon and an inherent mistrust of, or an outright animus towards, the Adeptus Mechanicus.

The Cult of the Pure Form does not sit by and wait passively for people to see its point of view, and indeed instituted their own group of missionaries. This third group is the most powerful within the cult, and are known as the “Reformed.” Acting as the public face of the cult, the Reformed are a large, sector-spanning network. They commonly preach that the God-Emperor had not a single cybernetic in the days when He walked amongst mortals, and that if He was pure of flesh, then so too should His subjects be. The Reformed mainly consist of Shriven who have reversed the process of bionic implantation, creating implants not of unholy cybernetics, but instead made out of pure (if sometimes misshapen) flesh. To the Reformed any inefficiencies or inferior function these parts have compared to the soulless steel they replaced is simply an expression of faith and piousness towards the very idea of the Pure Form itself.
### **Becoming a Cultist of the Pure Form**
There are many ways to be tempted to join the Cult of the Pure Form. For some, it is due to a feeling of betrayal, where replacement cybernetics have caused more harm than good, and the poor soul shackled by them is looking for a form of release among the ranks of the Shriven. Others, after hearing the words of the Reformed, have come to understand that the continued existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus is nothing but a disaster waiting to happen, and that it is their holy duty to stand in judgement of this abominable organisation. Others join out of a fear that if they begin to receive cybernetics that they will lose something of their own souls, and eagerly join the ranks of the Untouched to avoid this horrific fate. A select few might even be contacted directly by the cult’s senior members, as their membership would greatly benefit the cult’s standing and appeal across the Sector. The cult also offers a strong brotherhood and a cause to motivate new meaning into previously meaningless lives. Those who achieve such purity in their flesh may find their spirit even stronger than before, and certainly stronger than those who foolishly trust their bodies to the uncaring and dispassionate machine.

Upon becoming a member of the Cult of the Pure Form, the character gains the **Excommunicate Mechanicum Trait**.

**Required Career:** Any except Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Cleric—Rank 2 or higher (500 xp); All others—Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Any Acolyte who possess any bionics/cybernetics when taking this Alternate Rank must take the Purity of Flesh Talent before he may take any further Advances. Acolytes who do not possess any bionics/cybernetics when selecting this Rank must select the Gift of Purity Talent before they may take any further Advances.
#### **Trait: Excommunicate Mechanicum**
The Cult of the Pure Form is not a secretive group, in which members meet covertly in dank basements or crumbling hab blocks. They have made their presence felt and do not feel the need to hide their beliefs. The Mechanicus, in turn, view them as dangerous, misguided fools, and treat them with open disdain at best optimal servitor components at worst. Should any member of the Machine Cult learn of the Acolyte’s true allegiance, there could be dire consequences. If discovered, treat any member of the Mechanicus as having the lowest possible Disposition towards the character (and vice versa). The GM may even, in extreme situations, determine that acts of outright violence might be called for. Additionally, all forms of Interaction—even just speaking with members of the Machine Cult—are to be treated as **Arduous (–40)** before factoring in other modifiers.

*† This Talent has no xp cost, but can only be selected under specific circumstances. See each Talent's description for details.*
#### **Talent: Gift of Purity**
The Acolyte has forsaken the cybernetic, cast out the desire for the bionic, and joined the ranks of the Untouched. Never will sacred flesh be sullied by the implantation of devices that rob the Acolyte of his purity. The character cannot, under any circumstances, choose or accept the implantation of cybernetics/bionics, even if the result of refusing them would result in certain death. If the character finds himself implanted with cybernetics/bionics against his will, then he must remove them as soon as possible, replacing this Talent with the Purity of Flesh instead. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase, and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have no cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank.
#### **Talent: Purity of Flesh**
The Acolyte has participated in the Purity of Flesh ritual and emerged alive. Taking his place amongst the Shriven, he has become truly blessed, and despite his missing limbs, eyes, and other organs, he feels more complete now than he ever did with his soulless metallic attachments. All cybernetics and bionics that the character had previously must be removed, including internal cybernetic implants. If doing so would normally result in the character’s death, such as in the case of a Bionic Respiratory System, the character must also take the Reformed Skin Talent to provide a life-saving replacement, permanently reducing his Toughness by 1d5 and Wounds by 1.

The effects of removing cybernetic implants is similar to sustaining [Critical Damage](injury%20and%20healing.md#serious%20injuries%20and%20conditions) and the Acolyte should be attended to by a trained medicae to reduce the risk of death from the process. Augmetics that provide additional specific effects, such as a mind impulse unit or bio-power cells, cease to do so once removed from the body. The character gains 1 additional Fate Point (up to a maximum of 5) for every two bionics that he has removed (with the exception of Mechadendrites). The character must remove each and every augmetic from his body before he receives this benefit, so characters with quite a few may need to spend considerable downtime recuperating between surgeries (allowing their Critical Damage to heal) before they increase their Fate Points. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank. The character counts as having the Gift of Purity Talent for the purposes of refusing new cybernetics.
#### **Talent: Reformed Skin**
For those Acolytes who prefer to remain whole physically as well as spiritually they may take on entirely new flesh to replace the hateful cybernetics that have been removed. A Cultist of the Pure Form may select this Talent as many times as he has missing limbs, senses, or organs—any human body part replaced with a cybernetic or lost due to Critical Damage.

When taken, the Acolyte gains a replacement body part reclaimed from a servitor or an executed criminal. The replacement is not a perfect analogue for the Acolyte's original flesh, however, and imposes the same penalties that a Poor Craftsmanship cybernetic would (and, obviously, does not confer a bonus to his Toughness or a reduced chance of death from Critical Effects). Superior examples, vat-grown in bioreactors to closely match the Acolyte's body, may be purchased for 75% the cost of a cybernetic replacement instead—these effectively duplicate the Acolyte's missing parts and impose no penalties on their use (but still doesn't grant any special benefits or effects that an augmetic part might).

Any Fate Points gained from the Purity of Flesh Talent are lost when the missing parts are replaced with Reformed Skin, so the pious cultist should consider carefully how much he's willing to go without when considering a flesh-crafted replacement. Unless the missing body part would lead to inevitable death, such as a bionic cardiac system, the Acolyte is under no obligation to actually take this Talent. Reformed Skin costs no xp to purchase, though there may be a cost in Thrones if the Acolyte wishes to utilise a better quality part. 
## **Drill Abbot**

*“No no no! By the Throne, boy, how many times must I say it? Depress the loading catch before removing the drum feed, not while removing the drum feed! You’ll jam the weapon! Oh stop bawling, child. You’re ten years old, you should have learned basic autogun procedures by now. Fifty press ups and fifty Pax Imperiums, then we'll try it again...”*

— Drill Abbot Kross Vorgt
### **Background**
Drill Abbots are decorated veterans of the Imperium’s wars who tirelessly work at converting the orphans of martyred Imperial servants into driven and dedicated champions of Imperial values and society.

The Imperium has many layers of government, but those who rise to the top are often graduates of the Schola Progenium, a highly effective (if more than a little brutal) institution which every year produces untold numbers of Commissars, Arbitrators, Imperial Navy and Guard officers, and the great majority of the Adepta Soroitas novices. Many planetary governors and high-ranking Administratum prefects are Progena, and even more than a few Inquisitors began their long careers in service to the Imperium at such an institution. Such prodigies require tutors capable of driving home hard lessons and instilling discipline, honour, and absolute faith in the Imperium and its God-Emperor into the souls of the scared and lonely young.

The Drill Abbots are technically full preachers of the Ecclesiarchy, but are excused from a preacher’s normal duties of ministering to the faithful in favour of a more specialised role: namely, teaching the future leaders and guardians of the Imperium. This sacred duty is fulfilled through the focused application of devotional teachings and scholarly instruction, physical exercise, and proficiency at arms. They stalk the hallways of the Schola, striking the fear of the Emperor into the hearts of youths who one day may have the power of life and death over millions. Even the most ruthless Lord Inquisitor may still, centuries later, remember his time in the Schola Progenium with a mixture of awe and trepidation due to the work of these fearfully inspiring individuals.

Drill Abbots come from a wide variety of backgrounds, but most have served at least half their
lives in one branch or another of the Imperial military. They have seen first hand the enemies of the Imperium, and are anxious to impress upon their young charges the absolute necessity of faith in the Emperor and skill at arms. They are charismatic and inspiring, caring in their own stern way, and famed for their unbending stubbornness and strength of will. They seek to maintain their  fighting edge throughout their lives, and remain fierce and skilled combatants and warriors.

Many Drill Abbots forge lifelong bonds of mutual respect with the Progena in their care, which can result in useful contacts years later with some of the most senior figures in the sector. Indeed, there is at least one example of a Calixian Inquisitor recruiting his old tutor for his retinue, as a sign of the tremendous debt they owe for the gift of the light of the Emperor.

After serving so long within the Schola Progenium, some Drill Abbots find it difficult to return to active duty or to be drafted to an Acolyte cell. While these men serve the God-Emperor to the best of their ability, it is often a surprise when their commands are not met with cowering obedience. The more fearsome Drill Abbots have been known to employ particularly harsh methods of instruction, including branding, exposure to extreme temperatures, and sleep deprivation to motivate their charges—a source of understandable fear that some Progena carry with them for the rest of their lives. While tough and onerous, Drill Abbots are not cruel individuals. Any pain or terror they inflict on their charges is only done reticently and for the Progena's benefit, typically to give a little extra motivation to those lagging behind their peers in instruction. A Drill Abbot has suffered and knows how to administer it in turn if need be; if one can say nothing else, they are not people to be trifled with.
### **Becoming a Drill Abbot**
Most Drill Abbots are either experienced Imperial Guardsmen or Arbitrators that are ordained as an abbot by the Adeptus Ministorum, although this is strictly a formality. They are drawn from decorated NCOs of the Imperium's military and the accomplished lawgivers of the Arbites, as such men and women already have the experience and skills necessary to forge dedicated, loyal warriors from the rabble and raw material of the Progena. Although the process of indoctrination into the Schola’s more arcane educational techniques takes some time, most Drill Abbots are thrown in at the deep end and can go from fighting Orks in trenches and dragging recidivists from their gutter-lairs to moulding troubled adolescents into the next generation of Imperial leaders in a few short weeks. 

Encouraged to treat these children just as they would treat soldiers, the task of a Drill Abbot is not for the soft of heart. A certainty of purpose is required, and one must know that to show a pupil more than the bare minimum of mercy is to lie to them about the true nature of the galaxy and the threats it poses to the Imperium.

**Required Career:** Arbitrator or Guardsman
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** 20 Corruption or less. The character must be able to take a leave of absence from any other duties to teach at a Schola Progenium for no less than one year (the length of the Schola's academic season).

#### **Talent: Drill Instruction**
The character may bellow commands to all those in earshot. So precise and honed are these commands that all those who obey find that they are able to perform in ways they are unaccustomed to.

The character chooses a single [Basic](talents.md#basic%20weapon%20training), [Pistol](talents.md#pistol%20training), or [Melee Weapon Training](talents.md#melee%20weapon%20training) Talent that he has and makes a Command Test. If successful, anyone under his command or who chooses to obey (including other Acolytes) are treated as if they too have that weapon training talent until the end of the encounter or until this Talent is used again.
## **Feral Warrior**

*“I know not what they will do to the enemy, but by the God-Emperor I'd be terrified if we were facing them...”*

— Lord Luther Kronus, on the Imperial Guard's Mortressan Sythewinds
### **Background**
While the unnumbered ranks of the Imperial Guard form the basis of the military might on which the Imperium is founded, they are anything but a homogenised fighting force. Aside from the imposition of order and standardisation of wargear the Departmento Munitorum provides, each regiment is as individual as the world that spawns it, and many have traditions dating back centuries if not millennia. The savagery of feral worlds, both in terms of the constant warfare that their primitive peoples engage in, and the often deadly flora and fauna encountered there, make for excellent material for breeding men and women for whom enduring danger and conflict are second nature—and that's long before a lasgun is ever placed in their hands. In many cases, regiments raised on feral worlds (and even a few death worlds and the more unstable feudal worlds) are highly sought after by the Munitorum for their fighting prowess—indeed, that may represent that world's only tithe to the Imperium. 

These regiments typically have their number heavily drilled, forcibly educated and disciplined to bring them in line with Imperial Guard tactical doctrine and practices, but with the clear goal of channeling their warlike spirits in the Emperor's service. In some cases, the most bloodthirsty and savage examples may be allowed to hold on to much of their "old ways" of fighting, maintaining their brutal and close-combat oriented methods. Such warriors make for excellent shock troops and assault teams, able to charge through withering suppressing fire and force the enemy into savage hand-to-hand fighting where the feral troopers hold the advantage. Feral world regiments employed in this way typically suffer heavy attrition in their first battles, but this leaves behind a hardened core of elites who have successfully amalgamated their brutal instincts with Imperial weapons and technology. These assault veterans are the envy of almost every other Imperial Guard regiment, and can often match the fury of mankind's worst enemies, be the renegades, xenos, or servants of the Ruinous Powers blow-for-blow.

In the Calixis Sector there are a number of feral worlds that contribute significant numbers of fighting men to the Departmento Munitorium, although the characteristics of each are very different. Of those worlds with large enough populations to make the raising of regiments a worthy exercise, Endrite's people are perhaps the most notorious. Often deemed true savages by other Guard regiments, their reputation as a bloodthirsty and vicious lot is entirely deserved. Intensely superstitious, they kill and maim over the slightest provocation, and place little value on human life—even on own, or at least that's how it appears to outsiders. Eminently expendable, Endrite "head-hunter" regiments are quickly rounded up and deployed into conflicts where huge front-wide offensives are planned and high casualties are expected. The Munitorum assigns a few of their least subtle Commissars to keep the head-hunters in line, but their natural predilection towards violence means they rarely need external motivation to shove their bayonets into the enemy's guts. Of greater importance is a sizeable contingent of Ministorum preachers, as left to their own devices, the Endrites are liable to devolve back to profane blood rituals and worship of their heathen gods.

Of greater mettle and far more respected, the famed "Sythewind" of the feral death world of Mortressa, whose Guardsmen, armed with their ever-present hand axes, make for phenomenally adept scouts and infiltrators. The Mortressan iron-tribes are some of the most renowned hunters and beast slayers in the entire sector, as befits their survival against the veritable hordes of dangerous beasts that populate their world—including the Montressan carnosaur, widely considered one of the greatest apex predators in the entire sector. Ever since the early days of Calixis, a Sythewind regiment has been maintained and continuously (if slowly) replenished, rather than re-raised, owing to the world's relatively small population, with the limited number of surviving veterans given dispensation to return to their home world as an honour guard once their duty is done. There, they form a respected ruling class of elders who pass their knowledge and wide experience down to the young hunters of their tribe, creating a culture where to be chosen for Imperial service is considered the highest of honours.

Aside from these famed worlds, there are others from which savage fighters are recruited as mercenaries, swear allegiance to off-world powers, and are even abducted to serve as blood sport attractions for the wealthy and jaded. Fedrid, Volnox and even ill-storied Dusk have their own hard-bitten killers to offer, while the infamous strife-torn world of Iocanthos, with its long millennia of open, unmitigated conflict, offers the Ashleen technologically adept savages whose barbarity and fury often equals or exceeds the most culturally regressed and animalistic "true" feral worlder.
### **Becoming a Feral Warrior**
Whether a former Imperial Guardsman or a sometime mercenary who bartered his skills to leave his backwards world of origin, a feral warrior is a fighter who, while fully trained in modern weaponry and tactics, has remained true to his savage heritage and now wields anger and the brutal gifts his background has granted as his greatest weapon. The physical power and martial skills of the feral warrior are highly valued by Inquisitors who know that to hunt down and destroy the heretic and the abomination, they need the best and most ruthless fighters of their own. 

By their very nature, feral worlders are natural survivors, able to endure the worst hardships and not baulk in the face of injury or fear. They are used to fighting and acting independently, another asset in situations where Acolytes may well find themselves outnumbered and reliant on their own resources to prevail. Finally, the often "simple" nature of a feral worlder can make them quite resilient against the temptations of certain lines of heretical thought. When faced with a provocative idea or experience that might give pause for more learned Acolytes to stray from the path of righteousness, a feral worlder is more likely to turn aside in disgust, or possibly just smash the offending thing outright.

**Prerequisites:** Weapon Skill 35, Ballistic Skill 35
Many feral worlders were beast hunters long before they saw Imperial service. Of them, many come from cultures where, to survive their forebears, they had to become adept at bringing down the largest and most dangerous of prey. Such hard-won wisdom is rarely forgotten by their descendants.

Whenever you score a Critical Effect against a creature with a Size class of [Hulking or larger](traits.md#size%20%28X%29), increase your Damage by +3. This only applies to beasts and other living creatures—artificial constructs such as servitors, warp creatures and daemons, entities with the [From Beyond](traits.md#from%20beyond) Trait, or things with a completely unrecognisable anatomy are not affected.
## **Malfian Bloodsworn**

*"Now be a nice gent and come here and bleed on this warrant for me, eh? Then I'll make it quick for ye, otherwise I'll get a bit put out, and well… I hate swabbing the floor and getting nice parchment dirty. Seems so… undignified like."*

— Auric Kenge, Chartered Bloodsworn
### **Background**
The Blood Guild of Malfi is one of the most infamous organisations of bounty hunters and man-trackers in the whole sector. It owes its origins to a long forgotten internecine war in Malfi's history of vendetta and civil infighting—a history that far predates Malfi's "liberation" during the Angevin Crusade. The Blood Guild has long served to track down, apprehend, or slaughter fugitives whose warrants have been issued by the Malfian Senate. The members of the guild, known as the Bloodsworn, are consummate professionals at their trade. Drafted from the ranks of hardened ex-Imperial Guard, disgraced Arbites, outcast armsmen from the noble houses, and all manner of killers and gunfighters come up from the underhive the hard way, Bloodsworn have a reputation as the best men at their craft that money can buy. This broad organisation operates only one rule—a warrant must be carried out scrupulously and reliably. The individual Bloodsworn owe little loyalty to each other, and indeed several guild members might seek to execute the same lucrative warrant, fully expecting that they'll need to deal with their fellow man-trackers—likely violently—should they cross paths. Such often lethal "competition" is all but encouraged in the guild as a means of weeding out those not up to the standards of the guild's reputation, and the scoundrels and cads often far outlast their more honourable fellows.

Most blood warrants are aptly named, issued in the form of a tough parchment scroll bearing the seal of the authorising body and carrying within it a gene-lock circuit amulet designed to identify the victim by their blood when spilled over it. Some warrants may add further gruesome specifics to the discharge notice, like the retrieval of a body part, or a particular method of death blow to be administered to the target. The returning of the bloodstained warrant results in payment drawn on Malfi's own Obsidian Chancellery. Uncommonly, the target of the blood warrant may be desired to be returned alive, either for trial, questioning, or an altogether more horrendous fate than a mercenary's blade through the neck. Even though the return of the living target obviously satisfies the contract, the blooded warrant must still be surrendered as an ancient custom (and necessarily requiring at least a minor amount of violence be done to the target). Regardless of the particulars of the contract, falsifying a blood warrant in any way is a dire matter indeed, and if such duplicity is detected a blood-price of impressive size is immediately placed on the head of the malefactor by the guild. The blood warrant is a sacred instrument, and woe to any fool who would defile its probity.

As a part of Malfi's often impenetrable legal code and endemic culture of vendetta, a holder of a Bloodsworn Charter has certain rights above that of a mere common hired gun. The warrant enables them to bear arms in the hive where others would not, access to legal record, enter private dwellings, and even avoid interference (largely) from local enforcers and armsmen in pursuit of their warrants. These powers have their limits, however, and any Bloodsworn had better be wary of just who's property they trample on or in whose territory they operate lest they risk an abrupt and possibly quite bloody end. Critically, their customary rights do not extend to the holdings or persons of the Adepta or Malfi's rulers, although few Bloodsworn would be so foolish as to expect their warrant would allow them to barge into an Ecclesiastical convent or 

Originally confined to the sprawling hive cities of Malfi, the Bloodsworn have spread throughout the Calixis since the Angevin Crusade, and a blood warrant will likely be recognised almost immediately across the Malfian sub-sector. For the right price, there is nowhere the Bloodsworn won't track down their prey, and tales of wanted men being tracked down even into the Koronus Expanse are far from the stuff of legends and holo-dramas. The Bloodsworn are afforded a fearful respect throughout almost every developed world of the Calixis Sector, and aside from their quasi-legal role as bounty hunters, many also turn their hands to assassination, personal protection, and mercenary work if the chance arises. To those in the know, merely flashing a copy of the Bloodsworn's charter is an instant qualification of the bearer's capabilities, and can thus demand a high price for their services.

More morally flexible Inquisitors are not above hiring members of the Bloodsworn into their own service for obvious reasons. The Bloodsworn's skill at stealth and tracking, to say nothing of the cover his charter provides, would be a powerful weapon in tracking down heretics and clandestine cultists so that they may face the Emperor's judgement. Some radical Inquisitors have even backed their Acolytes to become Bloodsworn purely for the boons such associations give to their covert operations, although such an aspirant would do well to conceal the nature of their benefactor.
### **Becoming a Malfian Bloodsworn**
Becoming part of the Blood Guild is deceptively simple: the candidates must make their way to one of the guild's charter houses on any of the main worlds of the Malfian sub-sector, offer payment of a thousand Throne gelt, and, as long as they themselves are not under a blood warrant and are not otherwise subject to "higher oath", they are given a "grey warrant" to execute. Grey warrants are those that have languished uncollected on the charter house's books for some time, usually because the money offered doesn't merit the danger or expenditure of time involved in the collection. To become Bloodsworn, all they need do is successfully claim the warrant by any means necessary. This could include the help of others, and assuming they're willing to participate in such an endeavour, might form a small adventure for the other Acolytes to aid in. Once successful, the candidate must then swear a blood oath to abide by the guild's covenants, adding a sample of their blood to the guild's gene registry of members. The candidate is given a guild symbol and a copy of his charter as credentials, and may thereafter claim the right to the title of "Bloodsworn" and execute lawful warrants anywhere the guild's authority is recognised. 

**Required Career:** Assassin, Arbitrator, Guardsman, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Must gain a charter from the Blood Guild of Malfi. Arbitrators and Guardsmen must not be in active Imperial service when receiving their charter, and Acolytes of the Inquisition would need to conceal their true allegiance from the guild.

## **Mortiurge**

*“….The Guild-Dame was shot twice at close range while seated at her desk, once to the heart and once to the head. Either wound would have been immediately fatal. The killer had gained access though the front door, posing as a Provost-Captain, and left the premises by walking calmly out the way he entered. Evidence recovered at the scene implicates the Guild-Dame and several other prominent Guilders of bribery of cinq-port officials and cadre enforcers. Arbites Castigation Detachments dispatched. See attached log of execution warrants #77–134…”*

— excerpt from Case-file Monograph, Inhumation of Lady Clasis Hortva, Arbites Marshal Gregor Lund reporting
### **Background**
In the Imperium, totalitarian control and summary justice are often the norm rather than the exception, particularly among the teeming multitudes of a hive world. Minor criminals—vandals, drunkards, vagrants, trespassers, petty thieves, and their ilk—rarely see the inside of a court of law, not that most of them would have the means to pay for the services of a magistrate to advocate for their defence in the first place. The lawgivers, typically local enforcer cadres, are often authorised to mete out punishments on the spot, be they monetary forfeiture, confinement, some form of public humiliation, or just a modest taste of the boot and the truncheon. The great legal code, the Corpus Presidium Calixis, drafted by Drusus himself, specifies many such punishments and penalties for those who can't stay on the straight and narrow, and there are innumerable planetary and even regional laws and customs that could criminalise all sorts of conduct.

Generally speaking, more serious crimes—murder, sedition, obstruction of the Imperial tithe, theft of Adepta property, and so forth—are either punished with execution or very long incarceration. Although it is often perfunctory, a court is usually convened, and magistrates make their arguments for and against the guilt of the accused, present evidences, and partake in other acts of legal manoeuvring to get their desired outcome. If the accused is well-heeled or well-connected (and especially if they're both) this process can go on for quite a while, and the guilty sometimes go free over arcane technicalities and legal semantics.

In some cases, the authorities cannot allow that chance. The guilty must face the most severe sanction, urgently, before any other variables might derail the course of justice. Accordingly, both the Adeptus Arbites and many local enforcer cadres have need of hardened men and women whose talent lays in dealing death and summary execution, administering judgement before the frivolities of law can interfere. Singled out and specially trained to operate independently, both as snipers and close-quarter gunfighters,these specialists are commonly referred to as Mortiurges.

These troopers are typically drawn from enforcer kill squads under the direct jurisdiction of a ranking warden, or the feared Arbites Castigation Detachments tasked to deliver the Emperor’s wrath on the recidivist and those who would contravene Imperial Law without fear or favour.
Even among these cold-blooded killers, however, a Mortiurge would only be selected from those whose particular skill and callous dedication to their lethal duty makes them stand out from the rest of their fellow lawgivers.

By the nature of their work a Mortiurge works alone, singled out from his fellows by his differences in purpose, the blood on his hands, more often than not, a severe disaffection towards the normal process of law. In truth little more than judicially recognised assassins, they are often also employed to keep other lawgivers in check when needs require. As such, these singular killers are may be shunned by their colleagues and quickly learn to keep their distance, lest one day they be
called on to slaughter a friend who's been accused of a grievous misdeed and for whom facing a magistrate is far more than they deserve.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, some in the Holy Ordos, particularly members of its radical faction, whose doctrines and intrigues take them into direct and often covert conflict with the Imperium’s own authorities, find ready use for these highly efficient, if wholly disreputable, agents of order and social control. Inquisitors find unique advantage in a servant who is not only a highly trained killer, but who is also intimately familiar with law-enforcement procedures and willing to take out any target without passion or regret.
### **Becoming a Mortiurge**
Arbitrators who take on the role of the Mortiurge seldom do so voluntarily, as it makes them sanctioned assassins rather than servants of the law, but their presence in the Adeptus Arbites itself is considered by many a necessary evil. Those that do embrace becoming a Mortiurge often fall into two categories; the embittered and jaded veteran whose skills make them a valuable asset worth saving, perhaps despite their increasingly disruptive and rogue attitudes, and the cold-blooded killer, to whom the role of judge, jury and executioner appeals on some dark and fundamental level.

For enforcers, whose standards of morality and motivations are often notably more base than their Arbites counterparts, becoming a Moriturge could be seen as something of a promotion for those who enjoy kicking in doors more than taking bribes and beating hooligan juvies. Granted considerably greater freedom to act and persecute reprobates in their communities, the enforcer Mortiurge often goes about his work with an almost mirthful enthusiasm—from humble beginnings, he has become a law unto himself.

## **Ordo Sicarius Initiate**

"Some may be able to avoid the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites. Fewer may be able to face off against the Imperial Guard, and perhaps even the Adeptus Astartes. None can stand against the Officio Assassinorum."

— Tarik Ziz, Callidus Director Secundus
### **Background**
At the end of the Age of Apostasy and Goge Vandire’s despotic rule came a shadow conflict few have heard of and many participants did not survive: the Wars of Vindication within the Officio Assassinorum. The Officio had become riddled with corruption, and the Grand Master of Assassins was forced to kill many of its members in order to fully eliminate those still loyal to the deposed High Lord or who had fallen into irredeemable degeneracy during his rule. The Officio’s hierarchy was utterly shattered and needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, and for a time there was some discussion amongst the new High Lords that the Officio itself might be dissolved. 

As fellows of clandestine warfare, the Inquisition came to the Officio Assassinorum's aid during this moment of great peril. Following a thorough investigation and taking of accounts, Inquisitor Jaeger of the Ordo Hereticus deemed that a special order of the Inquisition would be created to help rebuild the Officio, and subsequently monitor and control some of its functions much more
closely than had occurred before. His proposal was accepted, and the Ordo Sicarius was created, with Jeager as its first Lord Inquisitor. As the Officio Assassinorum is a highly secretive branch of the Imperial hierarchy, Jeager and his henchmen understood that maintaining a typical hierarchy of control was out of the question. To preserve the Officio's ability to rive seamlessly through Imperial society the Ordo Sicarius would not maintain any formal structures outside it, instead fulfilling their duty by planting Assassin-Acolytes and, indeed, a few Inquisitors within their ranks. 

The masters of the Assassinorum know of the existence of these Ordo Sicarius agents, but not their number, postings, or individual identities. The Assassinorum and Sicarius follow an informal set of guidelines toward their unusual arrangement. Officially, the Officio Assassinorum does not attempt to expose or identify Sicarius agents, but those who are identified are marked and reported as such to their masters, who will withdraw and reassign the "made" agent. In return, if a Sicarius agent does uncover heresy or some dire conspiracy within the Assassinorum, the Ordo Sicarius will work in cooperation with the rest of the Officio to excise the malignant element with an absolute minimum disruption to their operations. Once a Sicarius agent is "made", his time secreted within the Officio Assassinorum is over, but the Inquisition has a great many other tasks that an expert at deception and guile could turn their hands to.

One notable example of the Ordo Sicarius' work dates from the early years of the 39th Millennium. Praetor Golgenna Angevin, a well-connected noble of the Terran Court, was raised to the rank of Lord Militant and granted a writ to prosecute a crusade to liberate and return the worlds of the Calyx Expanse to the Imperial fold. Among a cadre of Angevin's trusted counsellors and chamberlains was a man by the name of Dario Vereschagin. Unknown to Angevin or any of the others at the time, this servant was in actuality one Inquisitor Treyus Godan of the Ordo Sicarius. Inquisitor Godan's purpose was to monitor Angevin's crusade and to determine, on behalf of the Inquisition, whether or not such a singularly powerful individual was still loyal to the Imperium and faithfully executing the duties he was charged with. If he was not, then it was Godan's duty to eliminate him before Angevin turned the vast forces of the Crusade towards his own ends. A number of members of the Inquisition were openly serving in the forces of the Crusade, and could ostensibly fulfil the same purpose as Godan, but if the Lord Militant did betray the Imperium these badge-wearing agents and Inquisitors could conceivably be eliminated, or worse, co-opted. Godan, then, could serve as an additional measure to guarantee Angevin's loyalty. 

As the Crusade entered its third and final stage, Godan personally witnessed Angevin's acclaimed General Drusus slain by a rogue assassin. When Drusus rose from the dead, Godan was one of the first of the Crusade's leaders to recognise him as a living saint, a sure sign that the God-Emperor had blessed the Crusade's success with His divinity. Capitalising on this moment, Godan "revealed" himself as an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and officially (albeit without any sort of formal authorisation) declared the Inquisition's support of the new living saint. Reinvigorated by this moment of holy righteousness (and significant resources diverted by Inquisitorial forces) the Crusade barrelled ahead with newfound vigour, and most of the remaining worlds of Calyx were returned to the God-Emperor's light not long thereafter. Critically, by making the resurrection of Drusus a matter of Inquisitorial import, the conspirators who had him assassinated were outed, and the possibility of a religious schism over whether Drusus was truly a living saint or not was quickly put to rest before it could threaten the Crusade's revitalised momentum.

Godan, for his part, was censured for impersonating an Inquisitor, but received clemency in light of the undeniable results of his duplicity, and disappeared from the record shortly thereafter. Only a few within the Inquisition ever knew Godan was a member of the Ordo Sicarius, much less had been clandestinely monitoring the Crusade's progress and guiding the hands of its leaders the entire time. To this day, even many within the Holy Ordos are only vaguely aware of the existence of the Sicarius in the first place, but few would doubt their capability at deception and the crafting of cover identities for deep infiltration. Inquisitors whose work entails delicate and surreptitious investigation are often pleased to have an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius in their service, although some might give pause to the notion that the Sicarius-trained Acolyte could be keeping tabs on them at the same time...
### **Becoming an Ordo Sicarius Initiate**
Becoming an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius is no simple feat. The Acolyte in question must be both a skilled warrior and very capable at subterfuge. The vast majority of its members were chosen for induction by Assassin-Inquisitors of the Ordo Sicarius itself, the prospective initiates merely given a dataslate with the name of a target, and a stated goal of "Interrogation and Extermination required" written underneath. How, or even if, the prospect goes about this mission is his decision. Assuming the assignment is successfully completed, and the work is judged to be adequate, the prospect is clandestinely taken to the Ordo Sicarius' main temple and begins his training in the ways of the Assassin-Inquisitors.

## **Penal Legionnaire**

*“The Emperor loves me. Oh yes he does, otherwise why would he be so keen to keep me alive?”*

— Siris Tan, 2nd Calixian Pendal Battalion deployed to the Tranch Soot Warrens
### **Background**
The penal legions are a filled with scum of the worst kind. These murderers, rogues, deserters, cowards, madmen, seditionists, and drunkards fight for the Emperor in the bloodiest warzones—some willingly, some not. The penal units in which these villains serve are the product of the harsh discipline enforced in the Imperial Guard. With millions of men and women under arms, all armed and trained to kill for the God Emperor, there can be no leniency if order and combat effectiveness are to be maintained. The breaking of any number of tenets of military law and the exhaustive wealth of Munitorium regulations, up to and including murder, are all punishable by death—or service in a penal battalion.

The will of condemned criminals is not easily bound to the Emperor’s service, and so many methods may be applied to get these forlorn wretches into battle. These methods may include the generous application of lashes by electro scourges, or fitting the penal legionnaires with auto-injectors to flood their bloodstreams with frenzon, slaught, or other combat drugs and turn them into raving berserkers. Decimation of a penal legion that fails to advance is also a common motivational tool. In some cases legionnaires may be fitted with explosive collars which can be detonated remotely to reinforce an order or give instant punishment.

As it is intended to be a form of execution, just with an uncertain date, the penal legions are thrown into the most dangerous of engagements where the chances of survival are poor. Some go into battle filled with remorse for their crimes. Others walk like men already dead, their limbs trembling with fear. Some embrace the carnage and the prospect of their own death with madness or fatalism, knowing in death they'll be redeemed in the eyes of the God-Emperor. Most die in the opening minutes or hours of such engagements, paying a quick price for their crimes, but as long as the forces of the Imperium carry the day there are likely to be survivors. The fate of these souls varies. Most can expect to be cast once again into the cauldron of blood and fire to see if the
Emperor is yet done with their service. These rare survivors are a savage breed who can walk into the mouth of hell and emerge screaming their defiance at death. For a few souls—arguably those who should've never been offered the choice in the first place—service in a penal legion is just another bloody crime they can commit, a string of murders sanctioned by the Munitorum that only ends when the degenerate's twisted luck finally runs out. More rarely, those whose crimes are considered to be less serious (as far as offences that may warrant execution goes, anyway), serving honourably in a penal legion and surviving for long enough can earn a legionnaire a pardon, or at least reassignment away from the front lines.

Once in a while, the paths of an Inquisitor and a penal legionnaire cross. The Inquisitor may be investigating reports of heresy or corruption within the Imperial Guard or other forces present within the warzone, or could be tracking down some villain that's gone to ground with the conflict serving as cover for their scheming. Should an Inquisitor need some "local muscle" to aid him, requisitioning a few penal legionnaires would be a trifling process. A more puritanical Inquisitor is likely to return the misbegotten souls to their legion once the work is complete, while a radical might decide to hang on to them for future use—it isn't like a penal legionnaire has any better career prospects.
### **Becoming a Penal Legionnaire**
For the most part, Penal Legionnaires are there by choice. Facing the prospect of execution for crimes committed, possibly in a grisly, hideous, or humiliating way, many condemned will opt to serve in a penal legion, hoping for a quick death in battle, absolution for their souls before the God-Emperor, or both. In some cases, especially if there's a conflict whose outcome is uncertain, Penal Legionnaires might be forcibly drafted instead. The Departmento Munitorum places a moratorium on criminal executions throughout a given world or sub-sector, scooping up all the condemned prisoners as necessary cannon fodder to aid the war effort.

Occasionally, prisoners who have not been condemned to death, but who are chafing under long sentences of incarceration or forced labour, might volunteer to join a penal legion, preferring to take their chances on the battlefield instead of rotting away in a cell in some Throneforsaken penal colony. These individuals generally have the best chance of receiving a pardon, assuming they survive long enough to be granted such clemency.

**Required Career:** Guardsman
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp)
**Die Anywhere Else:** The Penal Legionnaire Alternate Career Rank must be taken during character creation, but can replace any of the character's ranks. Selecting this Alternate Rank at Rank 1 does not affect your starting Skills or Talents, only how and on what you can spend your starting xp on. 
**Memento From Inside:** A Penal Legionnaire starts with an injector rig implant or an explosive collar, depending on the particulars of the legion they were consigned to. The control device for this instrument of persuasion may be kept by another Acolyte or an NPC in the service of the Inquisitor that the Penal Legionnaire now serves.

## **Pyroclast**

*"You must face the truth squarely and without flinching from duty. Our enemies are mortal no longer. Mercy for such as they is a chimera, self-deception is its only ally. Dedicate this weapon, given unto your hand at the behest of the Emperor, to their destruction. Regard its function as your only duty: you live only to bring cleansing fire. Take up your rod and staff, your armour and flamer, and go forth."*

— excerpt from *Lectures to the Ordo*, Inquisitor-Historical Galbus Heer
### **Background**
The Holy Ordos of the Imperial Inquisition is a decidedly two-faced organisation. Many of its Acolytes and Throne Agents go about their work with stealth, guile, and subterfuge, investigating rumours, following trails of evidence, and planting the knife in the guilty, excising the tumour of heresy from the healthy flesh around it. Others are quite the opposite, descending on xenos infiltrators and Chaos cultists with all the subtlety of a military invasion and leaving smouldering ash heaps behind as evidence of the price of treason for all to see. The Pyroclast is decidedly of the latter, an expert in incinerating those who would truck with the God-Emperor's enemies with the purifying flames of righteousness.

Originally created as a specialist group by Inquisitor Malachai Heritor of the Calixian Ordo Xenos in 643.M40, the Pyroclasts were intended to be sent in when the only hope of ending an alien infestation was through the liberal application of holy fire. These cadres of elite arsonists first came to prominence after a debacle on the agri-world of Dreah, where xenos parasites—introduced by cultists seeking to expand an alien hive mind—were unwittingly planted throughout numerous grain fields by unsuspecting farmers. During the harvest, the stalks of this grain poisoned the tithe of Dreah, threatening to infest anyone who consumed the valuable foodstuffs later. Once the nature of the threat was identified, Inquisitor Heritor dispatched his most trusted Pyroclasts to Dreah with orders to incinerate the cultists and the entirety of the tainted grain. Hunger was widespread on many nearby worlds for several seasons afterwards, but the threat of alien parasitism had been halted in its tracks.

The Cleansing of Dreah was considered an unqualified success, and with the endorsement of Lord Inquisitor Caidin, the Calixian Conclave created a training bastion on the Shrine World of Reshia to formally bring up many new Pyroclasts so that they may aid more militantly-minded Inquisitors in their holy work. Within this bastion recruits are schooled in the nature of flame and the cleansing power that it holds. Those who have never met a Pyroclast might see little daylight between this training regimen and those flamer-wielding Imperial Guard weapon specialists receive, but comparing the talent of the two is akin to a novice Administratum scribe's to a true master of inscription whose prose flows like elegant art.
### **Becoming a Pyroclast**
Pyroclasts are mostly recruited from experienced Imperial Guard veterans. They may or may not already be Inquisitorial Acolytes, but all are at least handy with a flamer and have some level of appreciation for its use. During the time they spend in the Bastion Pyroclasm on Reshia this grows
into an almost religious love and faith, with many Pyroclasts seeing the righteous power of the God-Emperor in the flames they bring. Upon graduation, the newly minted Pyroclast returns to their master's side with a love of purifying fire that exceeds that of all but the most deranged criminal arsonists and Redemptionist zealots.

#### **Talent: Blessed Flame**
**Prerequisites:** Cleanse and Purify
The Pyroclast's flamer is more than just a piece of wargear—by the time his training is complete, it is a partner in destruction, almost an extension of the Pyroclast's hatred of aliens, daemons, and other such vile entities. Specialised training in holy rites of maintenance and litanies against the God-Emperor's enemies imbue the Pyroclast's flamer with the searing vengeance of the Golden Throne itself.

Performing the necessary ritual requires a successful [Common Lore (Imperial Creed)](skills.md#common%20lore) Test, taking about half an hour and consuming candles, incense, and oils worth 20 Thrones. Once the ritual is complete, all Damage inflicted by the flamer is considered "Holy," granting it greater power against daemons and other warp entities. Additionally, if the character has the [Hatred](talents.md#hatred) Talent, the flamer gains the Proven (3) Quality when used against any enemy covered by that Talent. This benefit only applies if the Pyroclast is wielding the flamer—another character does not gain its effects if they pick it up and use it themselves—and lasts until the weapon has expended its current clip, after which it must be performed again once the weapon is reloaded.
#### **Talent: Flames of Faith**
**Prerequisites:** Unshakeable Faith, Cleanse and Purify
By virtue of faith in the God-Emperor alone, the Pyroclast can imbue a tiny measure of His disgust for the great enemies of Mankind into his flamer. If the Pyroclast has the [Hatred](talents.md#hatred) Talent, his flamer attacks against enemies covered by that Talent inflict 1 additional Damage for every degree of success on the Ballistic Skill Test made to attack. Additionally, if the Pyroclast happens to have Psyflame fuel loaded in his flamer, the flamer treats all non-psychic enemies it strikes as if they had a Psy Rating of 3, suffering a –15 penalty to their Agility or Dodge Tests avoid being hit by the attack or set on fire by its effects.
## **Saboteur**

*"Any problem in the world can be solved with the careful application of high explosives. The trick is not to be around when they go off."*

— attributed to an ancient Terran warlord
### **Background**
 It is said by some of the more philosophically-minded Administratum thralls that everything within the Imperium is connected by endless invisible threads of interdependence, a vast web of commerce, trade, and movement of men that binds the whole together. From the astropathic messages brought to the table of a lord, to the food eaten by the lowest worker in a forge, all depends on something else to exist, and those in turn on other things. These threads of reliance form a vast entanglement of power and stability on which order, faith, and indeed survival itself depends. It is the destruction of these threads that is the Saboteur’s purpose, and for many, their most beloved art.

Saboteurs are craftsmen of panic, destruction, and downfall—sometimes all three at once! They are the loosed dogs of secret wars of destabilisation and terror that rage in the shadows of the Imperium of Mankind. Trained to move unseen amongst the great flocks of humanity, the Saboteur is a faceless agent of fear, mayhem, and death that attacks the physical and psychological fabric that binds the Imperium together. Many act as tools or proxies of larger conspiracies, sowing fear among the people and crippling the local authorities' means to resist the hideous plans of the Saboteur's employers. Others ply their trade for their own goals alone, seeking to topple institutions and spires out of personal animus for the rulers and powerful, or even just for the perverse joy of destruction itself.

Acolytes of the Inquisition are most likely to encounter a Saboteur in the course of an investigation, and will almost certainly be attempting to thwart the Saboteur's plans before they can threaten the very fabric of Imperial society. Yet, it is also not unheard-of for such cold monsters of terror to be found in the service of an Inquisitor. While unconventional in the main, it is true that grand conspiracies and heretical sects often depend on their own networks of information and material to enact their vile plots. Once uncovered, these can be severed with explosives and other clandestine, underhanded tactics just as easily, if not more so, than with a Storm Trooper deployment or a raid by an Arbites Suppression Squad. 

Sometimes a very deeply-rooted heresy can corrupt planetary authorities to its will or ephemerally secret itself within local institutions, becoming all but undetectable to even the all-seeing eye of the Inquisition. In such situations, a more radical Inquisitor might set loose Saboteur Acolytes to destabilise those very organisations, depriving the heretics of the facade of normality and pushing them out into the open. The cost in both infrastructure and innocent lives is often high, but those who would deliberately send an entire hive into anarchy to expose dire conspiracies within its guild halls and enforcer forts are quick to point out that a more "conventional", that is to say brute force, approach would likely be even worse.
### **Becoming a Saboteur**
A Saboteur's qualifications are deceptively simple: move surreptitiously and cause a great deal of targeted destruction. A Saboteur Acolyte will often lean on the training and institutional knowledge of his existing Career to identify structural and organisational weaknesses, areas where a little explosives or poison gas will have outsize effects on the body he's been called to cripple. No two Saboteurs are alike, and such an Acolyte is just as likely to be a dutiful servant calmly practising a trade for his master as he is to be a barely-contained menace, gleefully terrorising his fellow men with official justification that's often entirely too flimsy.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp)

## **Slate-Agent**

*"And who am I to be this year, hmm? A wealthy functionary in a dubious merchant guild? No? Hmm, perhaps a pampered Ecclesiastic keeping watch for detestable heresy within a suspect sect? Still no, eh? Well then, can I spend the majority of this mission indoors at least? Another Imperial Guard unit? How do heretics keep managing to sneak into those! Well at least I won't remember any of it after retrieval..."*

— a Slate-Agent, currently named Cavel Posdanik
### **Background**
On the planet of Malfi, a place often considered the "second capital" of the Calixis Sector, the men and women of the ruling class play a vicious game of politics and favour. This game is played not on any game-board, but in every palace, mansion, and villa. It is not played with pieces, but with the livelihood of their dynasties. The strategy of this game lies with political manoeuvring and favourable alliances. The stakes of this game are neither bragging rights nor pride, they are the very existence of the noble family, and the rights of rulership. The greatest advantage in this game of political infighting is information, preferably that which could shame and discredit a rival. In the pursuit of this sort of information the noble houses of Malfi have each developed methods particular to their own dynasty. It was for this purpose that the first Slate-Agents were trained. The Malfian house which first created the Slate-Agents is long forgotten, whether fallen to obscurity or risen to heights beyond all recognition, none can say. What is well known, however, is the efficacy of the Slate-Agent as a spy and operative. The secrets of creating a Slate-Agent escaped the Malfian backstabber-lords over a century ago, and other powerful organisations in Calixis—namely the Inquisition and the Adeptus Arbites—are known to employ these unique savant-moles for deep undercover work.

Masters of subterfuge and disguise, each Slate-Agent is a perfect operative of infiltration and observation. It is the gruelling process of their creation which makes a Slate-Agent so optimally crafted for their intended job. The first stage of a Slate-Agent's conditioning is aimed at wholly annihilating any sense of self possessed by the recruit, reducing them to little more than a biological machine in the service of their masters. It is from this state that Slate-Agents receive  heir moniker, as from this point forward, each Agent is a "blank-slate" on which new identities can be written. To achieve this, recruits are deprived of sleep, food, water, and dignity, as well as forced to endure horrific psychological torments, all the while they are watched for signs of opposition or rebelliousness. Once the recruit has been reduced to an entirely pliant and workable state, the trainers begin the slow process of rebuilding their charge. Using incredibly complex and methodical hypno-indoctrination techniques they prepare the recruit's mind to take shape around cover-identities, each of which includes skills, history, profession, and contacts, as well as personality and mannerisms, all combined to provide a flawless cover for the Slate-Agent. The trainers use psycho-conditioning to thread the recruit's psyche with triggers and fail-safes, in order to reset the conditioning once their mission is complete. Oft-times the conditioning of Slate-Agents is so complete that during their missions they are wholly unaware of their true identity until their loyalty is tested, at which point, deep-planted hypno-barriers close off the mind to any possibility of traitorous or mutinous thoughts.

Gathering information about one's target is the primary directive of each Agent. Infiltrating a targeted organisation, gaining access to its members' most heavily guarded secrets, and leaving no doubt as to their unfaltering loyalty to their target, these are the core objectives of each Slate- Agent's mission. The specifics may change depending on the Slate-Agent's controller and his targeted organisation, but information is the primary stock and trade of the Slate-Agent. For Malfian agents, having an ally so flawlessly inserted into an enemy's ranks often proves a dangerous temptation, for it is a simple thing to include a kill-order alongside the multitude of mundane orders during the templating process. This form of assassination is harshly frowned upon by the Malfian courts, although only because it would swiftly become a form of mutually assured destruction were this practice to become accepted. For Slate-Agents employed by other organisations, of course, there's often far less hesitation to deploy such an operative for both intelligence-gathering and murder should the opportunity arise.

Malfian Slate-Agents are often considered to be costly but ultimately disposable tools of espionage, meant to be deeply secreted within a rival house to feed information to their masters for as long as possible. Given the ever-changing nature of Inquisitorial work, those Slate-Agents who have been conditioned for use by agents of the Inquisition are often more aware of their true identity, at least subconsciously, and have even been known to have been templated with a multitude of identities at the same time. Slate-Agents in the employ of an Inquisitor can be seen as more of a deck of cards, able to flawlessly shift into a different cover identity as the needs of the mission dictate. This makes them an exceptional weapon to infiltrate corrupt organisations and heretical cults, and unlike the Malfian power-players, the Inquisition is absolutely not above utilising a Slate-Agent to terminate key members of a group they've been secreted into.
### **Becoming a Slate-Agent**
There is no set procedure by which men and women are chosen to become Slate-Agents. Functionally a softer form of mind-cleansing, the process is still painful and harrowing, and only the most absolutely devoted, penitent, or deranged would wholly volunteer to undergo the templating. Many Slate-Agents are coerced into the role by their masters, while others are all but forced to be "slated" as a form of penance for a severe failure. Inquisitors with a more whimsical idea of justice have been known to compel spies who have been caught infiltrating Inquisitorial properties or organisations to accept becoming a Slate-Agent. This allows the outsider to turn their existing talents at subterfuge to the Inquisition's benefit while giving a very effective guarantee of their loyalty to their new masters.

Upon becoming a Slate-Agent, the character gains the **Blank Slate Trait**.

**Required Career**: Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** [Unremarkable](talents.md#unremarkable) Talent
#### **Trait: Blank Slate**
The Acolyte is imprinted with several psychic triggers, known only to his handler. These triggers serve as prompts for the Slate-Agent’s identity programming. One trigger wipes the Slate-Agent’s mind clean of previous imprinting. Another prepares the Agent’s mind for re-programming. When a Slate-Agent is imprinted, the GM and the player may choose three [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore), [Forbidden Lore](skills.md#forbidden%20lore), [Scholastic Lore](skills.md#scholastic%20lore), or [Trade](skills.md#trade) Skills appropriate for the Acolyte’s cover identity. Until the Agent’s imprinting is wiped clean, the Slate-Agent is considered to possess all chosen Skills, and gains a +10 bonus on related Tests.

While an Acolyte's cover identity is "active" the Acolyte completely and totally believes himself to be that person, and even successful [Interrogation](skills.md#interrogation) will only reveal details about the Acolyte's templated persona. Psychic Powers such as [Mind Scan](telepathy.md#mind%20scan) will still reveal the Acolyte's actual identity and the fact that he's had a different identity templated onto him, however. The Acolyte loses all memories of his time under the active cover identity once the trigger is given to wipe his templating, so it is absolutely essential to fully debrief the Slate-Agent before attempting to prepare a new cover identity.

The triggers used to prepare and wipe a Slate-Agent's persona templates must remain absolutely secret, known only to the controller. Should the triggers become known to anyone else that party could implant their own template onto the Slate-Agent, possibly turning him against his masters or to some other no-doubt nefarious purpose.

## **Suffering Marshal**

*"You eluded me in Port Suffering. Your trail was faint through the wastelands, but I caught wind of your passing at Misk. You stayed out of sight, but your comrades let slip your destination before I gave them the justice of my boltgun. Finally, I find you here. You have run as far as you can, Vai Los, but you shall elude me no longer. Justice belongs to the God-Emperor, but your death shall be mine."*

— Stavlar Dorian, Suffering Marshal
### **Background**
Iocanthos is a harsh and brutal world, known for its chief export of Ghostfire, a crop used in the manufacture of the combat drug Frenzon, among other pharmacological compounds. Many lawless criminals and scoundrels make use of the vast stretches of untamed wild and the feuding warlords to evade prosecution and cheat the fate they so rightfully deserve. Iocanthos' unique political and social situation does not simply benefit "native" lawbreakers either. With multiple stable warp routes from Scintilla, Fenksworld, and Sepheris Secundus, bustling voidship traffic to and from Iocanthos permits many more skilled and resourceful fugitives across the Golgenna Reach to flee there in the hopes of going to ground from whatever authorities are in pursuit.

Port Suffering, the only developed Imperial city on Iocanthos, features a small Adeptus Arbites precinct house with a modest contingent of Arbitrators who serve a tour of duty for a few years before being rotated out to other postings. This Arbites presence is largely a matter of oversight of Iocanothos' spaceport and its brokering houses, ensuring the all-important Ghostfire export, which makes up the lion's share of Iocanthos' Imperial tithe, goes out without interruption. However, the world's growing reputation as a haven for wanted men, including some of the most irredeemable criminals in Calixis, has spurred the birth of an unorthodox sort of Arbitrator: the so-called Suffering Marshal.

With its sprawling steppes and deep, primeval forests, there is no shortage of wilderness a man who deeply desires to not be found could hide out. Furthermore, numerous warbands of techno-barbarians, vying for supremacy and the right to harvest the Ghostfire, are typically more than happy to hire on any of the more bloodthirsty recidivists, and they rarely give much countenance to a lawman bearing a warrant. It takes a stalwart and resourceful agent to track down this sort of criminal—a man whose dedication to the Imperium and its laws drives him on, alone, for as long as it takes to catch those who have so far eluded justice. This can often take months of arduous tracking and isolation from civilisation, forcing any who would take up this honourable if thankless task to be resourceful, quick thinking, and absolutely loyal to their purpose.

For this reason, only those Arbitrators with specific qualities are chosen for the testing rank of Suffering Marshal—those steadfast in their love of the law, those who have shown an aptitude for the hunt, a cunning mind, and a ready willingness to adapt to any situation or environment. It is these sorts of men and women who are chosen by their superiors to hunt down and mete out justice to those who could treat Iocanthos as a refuge for their wickedness.

Obviously, the Suffering Marshal represents a necessary deviation from typical Adeptus Arbites practices. The world's unique crop and tottering stability created by King Skull make larger military actions questionable—a crack suppression squad from a Scintillan precinct fort would likely find itself slowly ground down by the elements and ruthless marauding warriors eager to claim their gleaming wargear before they could ever hope to find their man. However, unlike most off-worlders, King Skull and many other Vai respect the authority of the Suffering Marshals, viewing them as closer to their own rough-riding warrior ethos and at least tolerating their presence whilst on the hunt for a wanted evildoer.

Granted wide jurisdiction through the whole of the planet, Suffering Marshals are free from the usual bureaucracy and oversight of the traditional Adeptus Arbites as handed down from the Grand Marshal Provost on Holy Terra. This gives a Suffering Marshal a great deal of personal discretion in so far as how he goes about his duties, which on Iocanthos is an absolute necessity of his work. Despite their noble intentions, and the undeniable results of their dogged pursuit of the fugitive, the mere existence of the Suffering Marshals is still quite controversial within the Calixian Arbites. The legalistic traditionalists consider them dangerous, buoyed by such operational leeway and free-thinking that a Suffering Marshal is liable to become a law unto himself, a violent predator hunting for thrills instead of a dispassionate lawgiver. Lord Marshal Goreman has so far opted not to weigh in on either side of the so-called "Iocanothos Question", reticent to risk a doctrinal split between the conservative judges who view the law as a matter of sacred dogma and their more liberal, often younger cohorts that want to get their man at any cost. Judge Porvin, the Suffering Marshals' staunchest advocate, has so far managed to avoid inflaming this controversy by only allowing the most steadfastly loyal and even-keeled Arbitrators to claim the rank.

As it is a Suffering Marshal's duty to put to death those who have already been pronounced guilty by Imperial courts, they are notoriously unconcerned with evidence-gathering procedure and some of the more florid aspects of the Lex Imperialis. Their talents and training lie largely within the scope of tracking their prey, driving them to ground, and overcoming them in violent confrontation. For this reason, Suffering Marshals tend to be straightforward, inelegant individuals, often considered violent and thuggish by already heavy-handed Arbitrators and virtually subhuman by Arbites Adepts. This is also likely the result of the theatre of operation in which they exist—a harsh frontier populated by hard-bitten Imperial citizens, primitive techno-barbarian marauders, and, of course, fugitive malcontents. In such an unforgiving environment and among such no-nonsense people, elegance and pretension are signs of weakness, not authority. In the end, the Suffering Marshal must be a very capable man-at-arms, as his canny quarry is almost never going to gracefully accept judgement when the Marshal inevitably catches up to him.
### **Becoming a Suffering Marshal**
The Suffering Marshal is often a loner, accustomed to working alone or with largely informal networks of informants, and they rarely cross paths with Inquisitorial agents in the field. A true Suffering Marshal is unlikely to be scouted for service in an Inquisitor's retinue—these Arbitrators take their charge very seriously, and few would abandon the hunt for a wanted man for adventure and intrigue with the Inquisition. Their reputation as ruthless and highly effective man-catchers, however, is far from unknown to the Holy Ordos, especially as other Arbites forces around Calixis have begun to accept veteran Suffering Marshals into their ranks.

Some more ambitious Inquisitors have been known to send cadres of their Acolytes to train under a Suffering Marshal, aiding the Marshal with his task and learning some of the unique approaches to tracking and field investigation the Marshals are known for. These agents are jokingly called "Suffering Fools" by the Arbites, but the animosity is largely superficial, and all but the most churlish Marshals tend to be happy to educate the Acolytes in exchange for their assistance. Once they've successfully demonstrated the ability to take down a fugitive the Acolytes are considered to be Suffering Marshals in all but name.

## **Tyrantine Shadow Agent**

*"Lest the truth devour all."*

— Memento Mori of Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos
### **Background**
The Inquisition, some say, is an empire of secrets. To outsiders, this is certainly the case, for in stern judgement and shrouded in mystery the Holy Ordos sit above them like wrathful gods, little understood and rightly feared. But what is not so widely known by outsiders is that there are many secrets the Inquisition keeps from its own, either because it is expedient to do so, or because they are simply too dangerous even for some members of the Ordos to know. These secrets are often held through invisible webs of patronage, fealty and alliance, but sometimes manifest themselves though shadow empires: whole organisations hidden under the wider umbrella of the Holy Ordos whose nature and concerns remain mysterious even to other Inquisitors and Acolytes.

Inside the Calixian Conclave, there is no greater divider than the Hereticus Tenebrae, more informally known as the Tyrant Star, and the Tyrantine Cabal is one such secretive and insular group striving to uncover the true nature of its menace. The supreme danger of the Star is not known to all even within the Inquisition’s own ranks. Even those who do know something rarely have anything but a piece of the puzzle, and there are many who dismiss the calamitous phenomena of the Tyrant Star as mere coincidence or superstitions. In no small part, the Tyrantine Cabal is responsible for maintaining this ignorance, just as much as it is investigating what the Hereticus Tenebrae represents and how to combat it.

As the years have progressed, this web of secrecy and control has taken on a life almost of its own, and methods and agencies have sprung up to support it and its master’s goals. One such powerful agency is the Tenebrae Collegium—a shadow empire all of its own founded by the cynical genius of the renowned Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. The Collegium takes the most promising and suitable of Acolytes and transforms them into subtle and lethal instruments of deception, whose true allegiances can remain secret even from the Inquisitors they serve. These Acolytes are perfectly suited to keeping the Tyrantine Cabal's purposes hidden and enacting its will without remorse or apprehension. The existence of the Collegium and its so-called “shadow agents” is a matter officially denied by the Cabal and the source of much secret debate, suspicion, and contentious enmity within the Conclave Calixis as a whole. How far does its reach stretch? How many agents does it have? And what darkness might go undiscovered lurking at the heart of such a strange and hidden power? Few know, but many outside the Cabal have grave misgivings, and it is entirely likely that its most entrenched detractors have fashioned their own secret networks to oppose the Tyrantines' scheming.

It is said Cassilda Cognos once quipped, in a moment of levity, that the Collegium “took outstanding dissemblers and accomplished liars and then began their work”. Certainly, the results of the Collegium’s conditioning do produce agents more than capable of moving through the Imperium in a carefully woven fog of falsity and misdirection. Using tiny gestures, key words and cadences, two agents can communicate vital information in the presence of others who remain none the wiser. Furthermore, using psychic and mental conditioning, a graduate of the Collegium can close his mind to all but the most destructive psychic probing, concealing his deepest secrets around a labyrinth of half truths and falsity to confuse, making them not only extraordinarily proficient spies and agents, but near-impregnable living vaults for the secrets of the Cabal.

The ultimate purpose of these Tyrantine agents is to firstly hold the Cabal above all other masters, to pursue knowledge of the Tyrant Star, and to keep that knowledge safe from all outside the Cabal’s covetous circle. In most cases, these goals coincide with the agent’s duties as Acolytes of the Ordos Calixis. However, where their true loyalties have come into conflict with the Adepta or even immediate superiors outside of the Cabal, this has led to cold and brutal conflict with those the agent would ordinarily call their lords, comrades, or even friends. So far, the Cabal has managed to keep all such “difficulties” from wider knowledge. The time may come, though, when the fate of all is at stake and they will have to act no matter what the cost. Perhaps a civil war will erupt within the Ordos Calixis as a result. This is a nightmare, however, that this secret empire, this order within an order, must bear, for their own fearful secrets are as nothing to the dangers of the Hereticus Tenebrae, and some must be sacrificed lest its truth devour all.
### **Becoming a Tyrantine Shadow Agent**
The path of the Tyrantine Shadow Agent is to be a spy among spies, his true loyalties hidden from his ostensible master. Shadow Agents are always vigilant for any new information about the Tyrant Star they can acquire, and then just as driven to jealously guard it from the prying eyes of those outside the Cabal. By default this demands the Shadow Agent conspire against the trust of his master and his fellow Acolytes, keeping his ultimate objectives hidden from any not deemed worthy of the Cabal's dread knowledge. An Acolyte being revealed as a Shadow Agent would face formal censure from their Inquisitor at best, and could suffer a far worse fate if their master is a more vindictive or covetous soul. For those who maintain their clandestine charge, however, loyal service to their true masters will in time reward them with ascension to the Cabal's inner ranks, and with it, the terrible insight of the threat posed by the Hereticus Tenebrae.

Taking this Alternate Career Rank is not just a matter of passing the xp requirements, it means that you have been singled-out by the Tyrantine Cabal to advance their hideously secretive ambitions. Advancing into this Career makes you a conspirator and subject to the Tyrantine Cabal’s secret orders and goals, and should only be selected if the contrivances of the Tyrant Star figure in to the development of your campaign. As always, consult with your GM and determine whether this Alternate Career Rank is appropriate.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

## **Warp Dabbler**

*"She would have been just a petty recidivist and peddler of harm, one of countless souls of no great worth, but then the warp found her, and she became a true monster. However, as she is a monster loyal to me, you and I are now in conflict."*

— Radical Inquisitor Soldevan to Judge Hiram Fulk of the Adeptus Arbites
##### **Background**
Warp Dabblers, sometimes referred to as warplocks and petty sorcerers, are individuals tampering—often quite nesciently—with the malignant arts of the warp sorcery. Whether cultists, noncompliants, recidivists, or amoral academics, these individuals have had contact with forbidden knowledge and have decided to further explore the possibilities it can offer. These are not true sorcerers or savants of the forbidden, but instead are dark-hearted warriors, soiled enforcers, spiteful adepts, and twisted killers who have acquired a degree of warp lore and have made the perilous decision to put it into use for their own gain. Although they may never achieve the terrible heights of occult power and knowledge that the true masters of sorcery can, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing—especially in the hands of often-desperate individuals on the fringes of society.

Warp Dabblers may have walked almost any path before they begin their dalliance with warp craft. In the case of recidivists and other minor heretics, they may be cultists, criminals, smugglers, or even gang bosses. Others could, at least nominally, be on the straight and narrow, including lesser academics, occultists, and even noble scions. The intelligence and strength of will to study the forbidden is not something that all can do, but should one with the potential be presented with tantalisingly proscribed power, he will often seize it and put it to imaginative (and horrible) use.

Blessedly, the sorts of fell knowledge that could start one down the path of the Warp Dabbler are not easy to obtain. The Imperium is, in general, an insular and ignorant society, and this is just as much by design as it is by cultural norms. The Ecclesiarchy constantly preaches rhetoric designed to inspire dogmatic obedience and abject abhorrence of the heretical and the unknown in equal measure, while the Imperial Inquisition considers censoring and limiting the spread of information considered dangerous or corrupting an absolutely vital task. To the average Imperial citizen, a formal education in academic subjects is a luxury, daemons are distant horrors portrayed in morality plays, and the warp is more of an abstraction of antipathetic feelings than a very real place of unadulterated power and anarchy.

In this social climate, it is onerous to say the least to obtain texts or information about daemonology, the occult, and the immaterium, but it is by no means impossible either. There are few things more consistent in human nature than the desire to possess that which is proscribed or
unobtainable. In the darkest corners of Imperial society—and often its loftiest heights too—banned texts, forbidden tomes, and other instructions in warp craft can be bought, traded, and stolen by someone with the right connections or resources. Tragically, some even find their way into the hands of completely unwitting souls who, in a moment of weakness, turn away from the Ecclesiarchy's blessed ignorance and furtively turn the pages of madness and damnation.

It is an unfortunate irony that the Imperium’s tireless efforts to suppress perilous malefic knowledge mean those who do manage to obtain such information often have little real understanding of just how dangerous it can be. To them, the rituals and incantations are just another tool to obtain their goals, or worse, an amusing frivolity with the supernatural bearing no great significance at all. Only when it is far, far too late, and the leering eyes and grinning mouths of thirsting gods are upon him, does the average Warp Dabbler realise how profoundly his actions have doomed him.

This is not to say, however, that Warp Dabblers are not formidable foes. On the contrary, those who survive long enough, avoiding detection by the Imperial authorities and destruction or insanity from the dread tomes they ply, often possess a combination of low cunning, resourcefulness, and ruthless connivance which makes them quite competent adversaries. In addition, the warp-fueled powers and daemonic allies they can draw on makes them even more dangerous, especially when cornered or desperate. Warp Dabbling crime bosses may take down their rivals with horrors summoned from the warp, while assassins may use sorcery to pass unseen and so eliminate the most heavily guarded of targets with ease. Cultists may attract their followers with forbidden pleasures and dark rewards, while protecting their secrecy with hexes and malefic curses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Warp Dabbler is thus a common quarry for servants of the Inquisition, a burgeoning moral threat who grows in power and danger every day he's left to further hone his hideous craft.

For Inquisitors of a more radical persuasion, cornering a Warp Dabbler who isn't already "too far gone" could be a profitable prospect. A Warp Dabbling Acolyte can call on his knowledge of the dark arts to defeat his opponents, gain a better understanding of their motives and operations, or even bend the powers of the warp against its own vile denizens when they manifest in the materium. When facing the prospect of execution, or worse, few Warp Dabblers would reject a radical Inquisitor's sanction to make something worthwhile of their lives, and with it, perhaps earn redemption in the eyes of the God-Emperor.
### **Becoming a Warp Dabbler**
An Acolyte requires both motive and opportunity to become a Warp Dabbler. At a minimum, the Acolyte must have a source from which he could acquire profane knowledge of the warp, along with the necessary moral flexibility to heedlessly study such subjects and their dire portents. The Acolyte’s Inquisitor might be a source of such possibility, as could contact with warp cults or forbidden tomes, perhaps made during the course of an investigation. Once the Acolyte chooses to dabble in the proscribed, he must spend an amount of time studying or being tutored—usually taking a few months, although a fast reader could conceivably do it quicker—during which time the Acolyte gains 2d10 Corruption Points.

Note that this Alternate Career Rank is intended to represent a more surface-level or casual understanding of the malignancy that is the warp. For Acolytes partaking in true academic study of the immaterium and what lies within, see the [Malefic Scholar](alternate%20career%20ranks.md#malefic%20scholar) Alternate Career Rank.
