## **Archexorcist**

*“I charge thee, foul spirit, whatever thy corrupt nature, along with all thy twisted minions now possessing this servant of the God-Emperor, by the mysteries of his holy ascension and enduring sacrifice in the sacred chains of the Golden Throne, that you tell me by some sign thy name, and the day and hour of thy departure. I compel thee, moreover, to obey me to the letter, I who am a humble servant of the God-Emperor. Depart, then, despised transgressor. Depart and burn forever in the outer darkness that awaits thee and thy benighted kin!”*

— Extract from the Codex Exorcismus
### **Background**
The senior members of the Adeptus Ministorum are fully aware that daemons are no mere allegory for wickedness, but real, unclean and unquiet spirits lurking in the warp, seeking to devour the souls of the faithful. The prelates and other high-ranking clergy fear the influence of these beings, and rightly so, for they are the antithesis of all for which the God-Emperor’s church stands, and their hunger is unending.

The Ministorum is not tasked with combating these entities: that is the role of the daemon hunters of the Ordo Malleus. However, a notable exception is made for the practice of exorcism, expelling daemonic presence from a possessed host. Such sinister machinations are often quite subtle, eluding detection in low hive hab-stacks and frontier parishes as the daemon works to sow discord, fear, and heresy among the faithful. It is the charge of the exorcist to identify these benighted souls and cast the daemon out of them back to whatever of the myraid hells spawned their loathsome existence. In this way, even humble clerics can do their part in waging war against Mankind's greatest enemy.

The Archexorcist, an esteemed rank created by then-Cardinal Ignato Borja, is facially a more respected member of this brotherhood of daemon banishers, invested with greater authority within the Sector Synod to investigate rumours of possession and expel daemons from the bodies of the faithful. However, this is something of a ruse by the politically-savvy Ignato—the Archexorcists are more akin to his own contingent of holy warriors, and are skilled in far more than just liturgy and exorcism. Suspicious of the Black Orders and their close ties to the Ordo Malleus of the Inquisition, the now Archcardinal used his considerable resources to obtain all matters of proscribed texts on daemonology and rare, valuable equipment to aid his henchmen in their righteous task. The end result is a functionally parallel coterie of daemon hunters, capable and knowledgeable fighters in their own right, but whose loyalty lies personally with the Archcardinal himself.

The Archexorcists use faith itself as a weapon to scour the daemon. Their prayers and hymns madden and deafen the servants of the archenemy, and their holy symbols and gestures blind them. Such is the faith of these individuals—as judged by Ignato—that they are permitted to study the foul texts of the enemy in order to learn the ways of the daemon and how to best resist their hideous power. However, unlike the radical Inquisitors within the Ordo Malleus, they scorn using the methods of the archenemy against him. They know better than anyone that such methods are inherently corrupting, eventually turning the user into that which he fears most.
### **Becoming an Archexorcist**
Clerics who have shown a particular aptitude for combating the malignancy of daemonic influence, especially those who have survived an attack by a daemon directly, are likely to cross paths with the Archexorcists sooner or later. The coterie never reaches out to prospective members directly, instead using senior clerics loyal to Archcardinal Ignato as intermediaries. These prelates will encourage the would-be daemon hunter to make a pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Illumination on Scintilla, where the Archexorcists can keep an eye on them. There, an elaborate and secretive path to initiation begins.

As the seat of Ministorum authority in the entire Calixis Sector, the Cathedral of Illumination contains many great librariums of arcane and esoteric tomes along with vast vaults of relics. If the candidate displays enough guile to try and find more insight into the ways of the daemon and the warp, especially if it involves sneaking into protected areas of the Cathedral, then the Archexorcists will finally reveal themselves to gauge if the candidate truly has what it takes to persecute the daemon in the Archcardinal's name.

## **Agent of Reliquary 26**

*“Ours is not an easy task. We gather those most important relics, those symbols of the culture of Mankind. We dare the darkness and travel across the stars clinging to rumour and legend as our guide.”*

— Marcius Dans, Agent of Reliquary 26
### **Background**
Entombed more than a hundred metres beneath the Inquisition's majestic if imposing Tricorn Palace is the Grand Reliquarium, a series of vaults that are home to many artefacts and powerful relics of the Calixis Sector. In these hallowed halls rest hundreds of items of power, from crafted trinkets of the Dark Age of Technology to the blessed weapons of venerable martyrs or even saints. Each of these vaults, of which reliable sources claim there at at least one hundred, are heavily guarded, monitored, and tended to by the Custodiatrix, a small organisation of curator-assassins, each charged with the safety of the artefacts and assigned to one of the vaults. Reliquary 26 contains the relics of the Scholariate at Arms.

In addition to housing artefacts, Reliquary 26 also employs a great number of Agents, men and women who scour the Calixian worlds in search of more items of renown to add to the vaunted collection. Whether through negotiation, deception, or violence, the goal of these Agents is a simple one: ensure the safety and survival of the relics of Man. To do so, they must first identify such items of power, decide whether or not the current ownership is valid, and reclaim the item in question, by force if necessary. Often, Agents act alone or in pairs, though it is not uncommon for an entire cadre of mercenaries to be hired if an acquisition proves particularly difficult. It is rumoured that that the Scholariate at Arms once hired an entire house of assassins to reclaim a relic from the blessed armour of Saint Drusus, though the veracity of such a rumour could never be proven.

As one might expect, Agents of Reliquary 26 are very well outfitted. Although they are relatively unknown as an organisation, members often find themselves at odds with Calixian nobles, Ecclesastical prelates, Rogue Traders, and mercantile magnates—individuals who often value their possessions and do not wish to part with them simply because the Inquisition asks nicely. As a result, many Agents have at least one or two enemies in the upper echelons of Imperial society. Though the agency does attempt to reimburse the owners of the relics they acquire, it is not uncommon for them to have to pry the artefact in question from the lifeless fingers of some greedy soul that simply couldn't part with it for any amount of compensation.

Reliquary 26 works quite closely with the larger Ordos of the Inquisition. Often, Inquisitors find themselves with items of interest left over from an investigation. In exchange for the safe return of any relics or artefacts found by an Inquisitor in the course of his duties, Reliquary 26 will often return the favour by loaning out an item of great power. Many Inquisitors are quite content to employ Agents of Reliquary 26 in their Acolyte cells, profiting from the Agents' access to rare and often powerful devices while maintaining a mutually-beneficial relationship with the Custodiatrix. 
### **Becoming an Agent of Reliquary 26**
An experienced servant of Reliquary 26 is an indispensable resource to an Acolyte cell. When dealing with nobility or other well-to-do types, or in areas where ancient or xenos technology may
be encountered, an Inquisitor would be well served by requisitioning an Agent of Reliquary 26's services. Such Agents usually only serve the Inquisitor the duration of the investigation at hand. Inquisitors who must regularly navigate such treacherous situations have been known to second a trusted Acolyte to the Custodiatrix to be trained in their ways, effectively gaining a permanent "representative" to Reliquary 26's hallowed armoury. As the point of contact between the Grand Reliquarium and the often covetous owners of the sought-after artefacts, most Agents become quite adept at negotiation and tradecraft. Such skills can be invaluable to an Acolyte cell, especially in situations where a hostile acquisition could be more troublesome than normal.

**Required Career:** Any Career
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Must have acquired one item of Near Unique Availability or rarer, and turned it over to his Inquisitor or directly to the Grand Reliquarium.
**Aggrieved Parties:** Even if the character has not personally wronged them, at least one group of well-heeled individuals gravely dislikes Reliquary 26. The character gains the [Rival (Ecclesiarchy), (Nobility), or (Rogue Trader)](talents.md#rival) Talent at the GM's discretion.
**Reliquary Loan:** The Grand Reliquarium has resources that include ancient and exotic equipment that is sometimes entrusted to Acolytes serving an Inquisitor. At the beginning of each mission the character gains one valuable item determined by the GM. Unless the character receives some special dispensation, the item must be returned after the mission, with grave consequences for those who try to deprive the Reliquarium of their property. The GM should choose an item that they feel is appropriate to the Acolyte's mission.

## **Banisher**

*"To defeat the Daemon, you must hate the Daemon. To hate the Daemon, you must know the Daemon. To know the Daemon is to know madness."*

— Daemon hunter proverb
### **Background**
In the eternal battle against the Enemy Beyond, faith and knowledge are powerful weapons. Few within the Holy Ordos wield these weapons with greater prowess than the Banisher. Whether stalking the darkest halls of a hive librarium in search of omens or enacting the Rites of Dispossession in the fields of battle, daemonic lore is vitally important to the servants of the Collegia Exterminatus.

Banishers in the Calixis Sector are a relatively new phenomenon. In 335.M41, a small cabal of Ordo Malleus Inquisitors came to the Calixis Sector on the trail of a prophecy regarding the revival of a greater daemon. Lord Inquisitor Gordian of the Calixian Conclave's High Council found himself most impressed with their retinue of scholar-priests, who studied a rare copy of a book called the Liber Daemonica to learn their enemy’s tricks. Although the Inquisitors and their tome soon moved on, Gordian's interest in the obvious applications of the scholar-priests only grew. The Calixian Conclave decreed that Ecclesiarchal resources could not be adequately spared for the task of researching daemonic threats in the vast quantities required, while many adepts likely would not have the faith and mental fortitude necessary to inure themselves against the information they might uncover. Thus, the Calixian Ordo Malleus began to formalise the training of the Banishers, a type of holy warrior who would be equally skilled at learning the nature of the daemonic threat and then exterminating them whenever they would appear. Any Inquisitor who would call himself a daemon hunter would be wise to have several of these individuals among his immediate companions, with more acting behind the scenes to uncover a daemons’ dark secrets and the most optimal ways of destroying it.

Banishers in the Calixis Sector are, like many other agents raised by the unusual partnership between the Ecclesiarchy and the Ordo Malleus, chosen at a young age from the most pious children. Their training takes quite a few years as they are armed with the tools to seek out forbidden knowledge whilst preserving their faith against the temptations that such profane secrets inevitably carry. Such is the intensity of their conditioning that newly-graduated Banishers often look older than their years, and it is not uncommon for them to bear wicked-looking scars or augmetic replacements for injuries suffered in the course of learning their place.

The great majority of Banishers are seconded directly into the Acolyte networks of Ordo Malleus Inquisitors upon their investiture. Experienced Acolytes revere them for their wisdom and temperance in the face of terrible secrets, and often owe their survival and success to the madness the Banisher has interpreted in their stead. Yet these same Acolytes know that no mind can understand the unknowable and walk away truly unscathed, and many Banishers are seen with a distant respect, watched closely for fear that they may suddenly snap under the weight of their profane insight.
### **Becoming a Banisher**
To be a Banisher is a life's calling, a position chosen from a young age by some of the most powerful organisations in the sector. Any who know the truth of the daemonic threat and wisely rage against it might call themselves a daemon hunter, but only a Banisher can say he's been trained from a very young age to truly hate such a profound enemy. The Banisher must seek out knowledge most believe is best left buried, bringing a scholarly mind to a field of study that, by its very nature, threatens the souls of all who would try to master it. They combine their esoteric lore with ironclad faith in the God-Emperor, all while ready and willing to take up blessed arms to fight His most nefarious foes. Their will is fortified against the madness which accompanies such endeavours, for they must go where few dare. They must be prepared to face many horrors in their search for manuscripts, ancient legends, and even the true names of entities of pure malice.

**Required Career:** Cleric
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 only (0 xp)
**This Is My Calling:** The Banisher Alternate Career Rank must be chosen during character creation, replacing the Cleric's Rank 1 (Novice). The character keeps their starting Skills and Talents, and also gains the [Hatred (Daemons)](talents.md#hatred) Talent. Replace the Cleric's normal starting equipment with a Banisher Staff—a Best Craftsmanship staff with the Sanctified Trait—a generic stub revolver and 12 Sanctified bullets, a chain coat or flak vest, an aquila necklace, a charm, and a backpack.
**Blessed Lore Seeker:** The Banisher cares little for the politics, intrigue, and influence trading that often afflict many within the Ecclesiarchy. His interests lay elsewhere, namely in learning as much as possible about the nature and threat of daemons and how best to hurl them back into the warp. The character is considered Learned Class for the purposes of determining monthly income.

You are especially adept at rationalising words and text and stripping them of their power over your mind. If called to make a Test against Fear, Insanity, or Corruption as a result of reading or hearing forbidden words or language (such as from reading a corrupted tome), you may re-roll any failed Willpower Tests, substituting your Intelligence Characteristic for Willpower on the re-roll.
## **Black Priest of Maccabeus**

*"I walk in the footsteps of the Blessed Saint Drusus and I go about the Emperor's work. At my word the unclean spirit baulks and the heretic withers in shame. Who, then, are you to stand against me?"*

— Prior Cornelius Agrippa, Maccabean Exorcist
### **Background**
Known by some as the Black Clerics or the Ashen Confessors (and, in more whispered tones, by the fearful nickname of "pyre-crows"), these clerics form loose-knit orders of militant priests organised at the behest of, and with surreptitious support from, the Ordo Malleus of the Imperial Inquisition to aid them in their work. Such "Black Orders" are scattered throughout the Imperium, and form a tried and tested weapon in Ordo Malleus's arsenal against the hideous spawn of the warp. In the Calixis Sector, the Inquisition chose to base their Black Order on Maccabeus Quintus, an often overlooked shrine world and home to a particularly aesthetic and mystical interpretation of the Imperial Creed. It is also a world removed from the intrigues and power struggles of the sector's Ecclesiastical politics and, therefore, perfect for their needs. Technically, the mere existence of the Black Orders defies the longstanding Decree Passive which forbids the Ecclesiarchy from maintaining forces of "men at arms". Of course, as they are organised with implicit support and guidance from the Inquisition itself, anyone who matters that voices criticism of this arrangement is swiftly encouraged to desist if they know what's right for them.

Black Priests are periodically selected from promising members of the Ministorum's clergy who meet certain criteria identified by handlers within the Ordo Malleus. These priests are identified for their strength of will, the power of their faith, and in many cases, by dint of survival when confronted by malefic forces in the past. A prospective candidate is then approached by an Inquisitorial representative with an offer of a uniquely higher calling in hand. This is largely a formality—clerics who have survived the wrath of warp abominations are often eager to learn the ways in which they can exact the Emperor's vengeance upon them, and the Malleus have various methods of "encouraging" those who might not be as enthusiastic about the idea.

Once in the care of the Black Order, the candidates are subject to extensive testing and interrogation, with some noting that this questioning is only a few steps removed from what a suspected heretic might endure. A few prospects of weaker constitution do not survive the process, which is just as well—the Ordo Malleus needs its erstwhile auxiliaries to be durable in both mind and body. Those who pass the examination are welcomed into the Black Order and receive the "Maccabean Rites", a battery of esoteric lore about the nature of the daemonic threat and how the newly-frocked Black Priest might use their will and purity of faith to castigate the vile wretches. Black Priests are forever changed by this experience, now set apart from their fellows in the Ministorum by virtue of the dark and secret truths they now carry. 

The road of a Black Priest is a hard one, and rarely one long-lived. This is not simply because of the weight of the knowledge he carries, but because by his very nature he is driven to confront Mankind's greatest enemy, barrelling with grim determination into the most dangerous of situations against the worst of foes. Many Black Priests leave the Order's compound on Maccabeus Quintus to directly join the retinue of daemon hunter Inquisitors, ready and desirous to begin the holy work of casting daemons back into the warp and smiting their mortal consorts. Others are sent back to Ecclesiastical postings throughout the sector to carry on clerical duties whilst remaining vigilant for telltale signs of daemonic threats, possession, and other depraved works of the warp-spawned. As a matter of particular interest, even if they were dogmatically opposed, no Calixian exorcist worth his title would ever turn down the assistance of a Black Priest. 

In appearance and demeanour, Maccabean Black Priests live up to their pyre-crow epithet, eschewing the all-too-common Ecclesiastical preferences towards ornamentation or extravagance of appearance in dress. Most go about their work in simple black or ashen robes, largely unadorned save for religious icons and relics, and even those are often rendered in simple iron or steel instead of any precious metals. Weapons and armour are likely to be blackened with pyre ash too, and there are no shortage of juvie jests involving a "Crow Priest" and faint trails of soot. The Black Priest's manner is likely to be grim, unforgiving, and humourless, although some do allow themselves a measure of gallows wit when interacting with laypeople. They are fanatics in their cause, but unlike the spittle-throwing incendiary ranting of a Redemptionist, their zealotry often has the quality of cold, unyielding stone and dire certainty.
### **Becoming a Black Priest of Maccabeus**
Any Cleric whose faith is stronger than most and exhibits the qualities of a born survivor could conceivably become a Black Priest. The most important quality in a candidate is an undying hatred of the daemon and all it corrupts with its touch. A Black Priest must not only be prepared, but indeed desire to do battle against all matters of warp fiends and other abominations from beyond the veil. 

Assuming the candidate meets the Ordo Malleus' expectations, they need only spend sufficient time on Maccabeus Quintus to receive the Maccabean Rites before they may consider themselves a Black Priest.

**Required Career:** Cleric
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp).
**Other Requirements:** The character must have less than 10 Corruption Points when this Alternate Career Rank is selected. Unless the character has the Shrine World Origin and was born on Maccabeus Quintus they must be able to spend several months in training there to receive the Maccabean Rites. Note this career is not open to characters with the Mind Cleansed Origin.

†*This Talent may be selected without meeting the normal prerequisites.*
#### **Special: Encarta Maleficarum**
Some Black Priests, in order to further armour them against daemonic threats, are subjected to a secret ritual known as the Encarta Maleficarum. During this ritual, forbidden knowledge is burned deep into their minds, shackled with wards inscribed by occult means directly into the cerebral cortex. This procedure is rare and considered a radical one even by the most ardent of daemon hunters—aside from revealing even more proscribed knowledge, including some of the Ordo Malleus' most carefully guarded secrets, it can be extremely deleterious to the Black Priest's health, and death is common if the engrammatic programming suffers any complications.

Upon selecting this Advance, the character must spend the next 1d5 weeks in the custody of the Order as the Black Priests put his faith and endurance to the test and inscribe burning lore into his mind. As a result of this procedure's harmful side effects, the character gains 1d5 Insanity Points and permanently reduces his Toughness and Fellowship by 1d5 each.

This heavy price buys fearful knowledge and further buttresses the Black Priest against the whiles of the daemon. The character gains the [Forbidden Lore (Ordo Malleus)](Skills.md#forbidden%20lore) Skill and the [Insanely Faithful](talents.md#insanely%20faithful) Talent. Additionally, the character gains a +10 bonus on all Tests made to resist torture and interrogation, attempts to read or control his mind, and the effects of [Possession](traits.md#possession). In addition, if an attempt to read or control his mind does succeed, but by less than three degrees of success, the assault or intrusion is blocked by the wards within his mind—it fails and he collapses in a catatonic state for 1d10 minutes.
## **Confessor**

*“There are many who have transgressions against the God-Emperor they need to confess. This simple act of admitting one's own sins is the first step towards redemption. It is the duty of the Confessor to
hear these sins and deliver absolution to the penitent, especially of those in greatest need... I speak, of course, of the unwilling.”*

— Archbishop Calid Braygan
### **Background**
With the ever-present threat of heresy hiding in the souls of the weak-willed, the Ecclesiarchy has long stressed confession as one of the central pillars of the Imperial Creed. Regular confession of one's sins clears the mind of doubts, reinforces the importance of faith in everyday life, and provides a healthy outlet for moments of spiritual weakness. The Confessor, a firm but fair arbiter of sins and what penance is necessary to absolve them, is the appointed clergy to receive such soulful contrition.

The Ecclesiarchy's grand churches will often have several sedentary Confessors in attendance, hearing a constant string of confessions of citizens day in and day out. In other areas, the Confessor is likely to be a roaming official, moving from posting to posting and hearing many confessions at once in great revivals where the citizens are urged to loudly proclaim their misdeeds before both the Confessor and their fellows. The itinerant Confessor thus becomes a rhetorical force, relying on the strength of his personality and passionate exhortations to take the place of the Ecclesiarchy's great edifices and their lofty offices. Some more cloistered clerics who rarely venture outside their parishes are liable to dismiss the travelling Confessor as a boorish rube, but the wise understand the power of a man whose passion can spur whole communities to throng from their homes and beg him for the Emperor's forgiveness.

As sin is immortal, the Confessor's work is never truly done. Having heard the confessions of the masses and assigned the appropriate penances, the Confessor then turns his attentions to those who have been denounced as sinners by their fellows but are conspicuously absent from the public pronouncements. These souls, it is reasoned, must be especially burdened by guilt, and it is the Confessor's duty to relieve them of their guilt—forcibly, if necessary. The Confessor, then, need also be a skilled explicator, capable of eliciting confessions even from those who'd rather not give them. Absolution of sin is so paramount that the guilty must be made contrite, even if it requires shaming, degradation, or torture to bring about. The Confessor takes no joy in humiliating and agonising faithful subjects of the God-Emperor in this way, but he must still carry it out with the same vigour and enthusiasm as he does in receiving confessions from the willing all the same.

Confessors, being powerful men of faith and often of no fixed address, are frequently seconded to Imperial Guard regiments, Planetary Defence Forces, and other militant organisations that can use some extra spiritual backbone. The Confessor's rhetoric and evangelising strengthens the fighting men's resolve, absolving them of their sins and urging them to greater feats of bravery in the battle to come. The Confessor's talents at identifying recusant sinners and dragging them back into the God-Emperor's good graces is especially useful here, as there are ample examples of crushing military defeats have been brought about by the moral failings of a few men at an inopportune moment. 

For many of the same reasons, a Confessor can be an ideal Acolyte for more puritanical Inquisitors. Largely unconnected to the Ecclesiarchy's political manoeuvrings and the trappings of high office, Confessors are often indifferent to what they perceive as frivolities of station and other excessive formalities. If service in an Inquisitor's retinue will help him save the souls of more sinners—and in Inquisitorial work, these tend to be in high number—a Confessor is likely to leap at the chance. The Confessor's various methods of compelling a confession from from the recalcitrant is a particular boon, and there are many puritanical Interrogators who were once ordinary Confessors who simply answered a higher calling.

### **Becoming a Confessor**
While many Confessors operating in the Calixis Sector are trained at one of the Adeptus Ministorum's special shrines, a sort of Ecclesiastical schola to teach the various methods of eliciting repentance, quite a few are trained in private by experienced Confessors in the course of their travels. A great many itinerant Confessors began as novices learning under a wizened expert, and it is not at all uncommon to encounter a Confessor plying his trade with the assistance of a hopeful candidate. Some novice Clerics come quickly to the Confessor's craft, especially those of particularly pure heart and mind, while others realise their true calling later in their careers, often after chafing under what they see as unnecessary pomposity and ceremony within the Ecclesiarchy's rigid structures. 

**Required Career:** Cleric
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp)
**This Is My Calling:** A character who replaces Rank 1 with the Confessor Alternate Career Rank also replaces their starting skills and equipment. A Confessor begins play with the Speak Language (Low Gothic), Common Lore (Imperial Creed), Interrogation, and Literacy Skills. Replace the Cleric's normal starting equipment with a generic stub revolver and 20 bullets, a copy of the Liber Excruciatus, an aquila necklace, a charm, 4 candles, a backpack, and shield robes.
**True Believer:** Confessors strive only to absolve the sinners of the burden of guilt they carry, and most have little use for excessive material trappings that many Clerics seem to gather. The character is considered Supine Class for the purposes of determining monthly income.

## **Cult of the Pure Form**

*"The flesh is strong!"*

— Pure Form maxim
### **Background**
Given the intense liturgical "differences" between them, the Ecclesiarchy and the Adeptus Mechanicus have never enjoyed a healthy working relationship within the Calixis Sector. Conflicts between the two organisations tend to be wars of words, though, political battles fought in the capital worlds of the Sector, rather than outright "shooting wars" between men and machines. Nevertheless, there have been several overt conflicts, such as the attack on the Explorator vessel *Omega Inquiry* from an Adepta Sororitas strike force on the far edges of the Halo Stars. There are no official records of the encounter, but the Tricorn contains sealed datavaults hinting at a heretofore undiscovered abhuman strain that the Mechanicus had uncovered far from civilised space, and the Ministorum’s reactions of horror when their spies reported the discovery. Greatly displeasured by the loss of the Explorator coterie, a Mechanicus Secutor cohort laid waste to two outpost convents in retaliation, and was about to escalate further before secretive diplomacy and unnamed offerings negotiated by third parties settled the matter. Such incidents are still rare, but with the gradual rise of a group calling itself the Cult of the Pure Form, this could begin to change.

It is not known exactly who founded the Cult of the Pure Form, but their influence began in the Malfian Sub-Sector in the immediate aftermath of the Malygrisian Heresy. The traitorous Tech- Priest and his followers ravaged numerous worlds with their devastating weaponry, and some began to think that the existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus would lead to another, inevitable war. The followers of this emerging cult feared that this coming doom would scour humankind from the galaxy, leaving only the cold, barely-human flesh and machine hybrids of the Mechanicus domains behind. This twisted line of logic grew quickly until the first major anti-Mechanicum movement of the Calixis Sector’s history began to swell, with loud marches and violent demonstrations.

In an unexpected move, and one that likely came about due to Cult Mechanicus political manoeuvring on Scintilla, the Sector Synod declared the emergent cult apostate. Over the next decades the cult leaders began to disappear, some dying in mysterious accidents while others perished in what were clearly outright assassinations. Some thought that the Inquisition was to blame, and others whispered of the Officio Assassinorum’s involvement, but very few were aware that the secretive Lords Dragon of the Mechancius bore sole responsibility for this early intervention, and that their clandestine methods had managed to stifle the movement before it
could truly become established. For its part, the Calixian Inquisition viewed this suppression as a grievous overstep of the Lords Dragon's authority beyond the realm of the Lathes, and it was made abundantly clear to the Magi that another transgression of that scale would engulf them in a true shadow war they were not liable to win.

After more high-level negotiation, the Lords Dragon agreed to cease their campaign of suppression, handing over all information they had gathered on the new sect for the Inquisition to process as it saw fit. While the watchers of the Panopticon hoped that the Inquisition would continue their work in stamping out the Cult of the Pure Form, the Conclave determined it was largely harmless to the broader Imperium, and contented themselves to merely monitoring its activities for emergent signs of heresy.

With the bionic boot of the Lords Dragon permanently removed from its figurative throat, the Cult of the Pure Form rose once again, finding succour and eager supporters anywhere common men took umbrage to the Mechanicus' abuses or superstitious fear of its unknowable rites. This time, however, a new generation of cult leaders threw out its previous methods in favour of a slower approach, and rather than attempting to whip the people of a single sub-sector into a frenzy, they would instead choose to let their hatred for the Mechanicus gradually simmer on worlds across the entire Sector.

A second blow came in the form of Ignato Borja, the new Arch-Cardinal of the Sector Synod. Under Ignato's stewardship the Ecclesiarchy curiously refrained denouncing the reformed Cult of the Pure Form. Indeed, Mechanicus spies close to the Ministorum's prelates reported that, at least unofficially, the Ecclesiarchy was quite content to allow the reach of the Pure Form cultists to grow, seeing any harm it might cause the Mechanicus as a potential gain for themselves. Even the Inquisition would be of no aid—initially suspicious of the Pure Form's return to prominence, many of the more puritanical Inquisitors who looked into the cult's ways began to see them in a positive light, emulating agreeable philosophies about the sanctity of the human body and acting as valuable check against the Mechanicus' own clandestine efforts.

Their mechadendrites tied, the Lords Dragon have been forced to passively observe as the Cult of Pure Form rose to prominence once more. Like clockwork, any egregious display of the Mechanicus' power beyond its forge worlds—an Explorator press-gang crew riving through starport public houses, or servitor-artisans systemically scooping up dregs in a hab-vault—is likely to be followed up by an agitator from the Pure Form arriving to preach about the sin and hubris of the Martian Priesthood.

As a matter of liturgy, the Cult of the Pure Form’s members—most of them, anyway—do not hate the Adeptus Mechanicus purely for their worship of the Omnissiah, and neither are they explicitly anti-technology. They simply wish to wrest control of such power away from the Mechanicus, proffering the provincial view that “uncorrupted” humans might control it instead. Their true ire stems from the extensive use of cybernetics and other mechanical implants that virtually every member of the Adeptus Mechanicus possesses. To the cult, the most pure form in the universe is that of the human body, an image of the God-Emperor Himself, and to defile it by removing untainted flesh and grafting on artificial limbs and organs is blasphemy in its own right.

Quite a few members of the Cult of the Pure Form have cybernetic implants when they join. These souls are often spurred on by dissatisfaction with low quality or cheap implants, or suffer a form of "cyberpsychosis" where they cannot perceive their augments as part of their own body and come to loathe their presence. These cultists undergo a ritual known as the Purity of Flesh to remove the implants from their bodies. 

This ritual often leaves the participant missing limbs or eyes, and can rob them of their ability to hear or even speak. Known as the “Shriven” by other Pure Form cultists, these blessed men and women are highly regarded, having seen the purity of the human body as it was meant to be and unshackling themselves from the augmetic prisons of the Mechanicus. Most will choose to replace their removed cybernetics with strictly fleshy equivalents, often vat-grown examples cultivated for the individual Shriven in question, although some are forced to make do with biomatter reclaimed and purified from servitors or harvested from executed criminals. Especially pious cultists have been known to reject even this, however, getting by with purely inert prostheses and simply accepting the loss of ability that comes from a missing body part as an intractable and, indeed, necessary aspect of the human condition.

The bulk of the cult’s ranks, however, are made up of those fortunate enough to have lived without the defilement of cybernetics, and are referred to as the “Untouched.” Each Untouched member comes to the sect for different reasons, but most are spurred on by a love of the God-Emperor as a human paragon and an inherent mistrust of, or an outright animus towards, the Adeptus Mechanicus.

The Cult of the Pure Form does not sit by and wait passively for people to see its point of view, and indeed instituted their own group of missionaries. This third group is the most powerful within the cult, and are known as the “Reformed.” Acting as the public face of the cult, the Reformed are a large, sector-spanning network. They commonly preach that the God-Emperor had not a single cybernetic in the days when He walked amongst mortals, and that if He was pure of flesh, then so too should His subjects be. The Reformed mainly consist of Shriven who have reversed the process of bionic implantation, creating implants not of unholy cybernetics, but instead made out of pure (if sometimes misshapen) flesh. To the Reformed any inefficiencies or inferior function these parts have compared to the soulless steel they replaced is simply an expression of faith and piousness towards the very idea of the Pure Form itself.
### **Becoming a Cultist of the Pure Form**
There are many ways to be tempted to join the Cult of the Pure Form. For some, it is due to a feeling of betrayal, where replacement cybernetics have caused more harm than good, and the poor soul shackled by them is looking for a form of release among the ranks of the Shriven. Others, after hearing the words of the Reformed, have come to understand that the continued existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus is nothing but a disaster waiting to happen, and that it is their holy duty to stand in judgement of this abominable organisation. Others join out of a fear that if they begin to receive cybernetics that they will lose something of their own souls, and eagerly join the ranks of the Untouched to avoid this horrific fate. A select few might even be contacted directly by the cult’s senior members, as their membership would greatly benefit the cult’s standing and appeal across the Sector. The cult also offers a strong brotherhood and a cause to motivate new meaning into previously meaningless lives. Those who achieve such purity in their flesh may find their spirit even stronger than before, and certainly stronger than those who foolishly trust their bodies to the uncaring and dispassionate machine.

Upon becoming a member of the Cult of the Pure Form, the character gains the **Excommunicate Mechanicum Trait**.

**Required Career:** Any except Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Cleric—Rank 2 or higher (500 xp); All others—Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Any Acolyte who possess any bionics/cybernetics when taking this Alternate Rank must take the Purity of Flesh Talent before he may take any further Advances. Acolytes who do not possess any bionics/cybernetics when selecting this Rank must select the Gift of Purity Talent before they may take any further Advances.
#### **Trait: Excommunicate Mechanicum**
The Cult of the Pure Form is not a secretive group, in which members meet covertly in dank basements or crumbling hab blocks. They have made their presence felt and do not feel the need to hide their beliefs. The Mechanicus, in turn, view them as dangerous, misguided fools, and treat them with open disdain at best optimal servitor components at worst. Should any member of the Machine Cult learn of the Acolyte’s true allegiance, there could be dire consequences. If discovered, treat any member of the Mechanicus as having the lowest possible Disposition towards the character (and vice versa). The GM may even, in extreme situations, determine that acts of outright violence might be called for. Additionally, all forms of Interaction—even just speaking with members of the Machine Cult—are to be treated as **Arduous (–40)** before factoring in other modifiers.

*† This Talent has no xp cost, but can only be selected under specific circumstances. See each Talent's description for details.*
#### **Talent: Gift of Purity**
The Acolyte has forsaken the cybernetic, cast out the desire for the bionic, and joined the ranks of the Untouched. Never will sacred flesh be sullied by the implantation of devices that rob the Acolyte of his purity. The character cannot, under any circumstances, choose or accept the implantation of cybernetics/bionics, even if the result of refusing them would result in certain death. If the character finds himself implanted with cybernetics/bionics against his will, then he must remove them as soon as possible, replacing this Talent with the Purity of Flesh instead. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase, and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have no cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank.
#### **Talent: Purity of Flesh**
The Acolyte has participated in the Purity of Flesh ritual and emerged alive. Taking his place amongst the Shriven, he has become truly blessed, and despite his missing limbs, eyes, and other organs, he feels more complete now than he ever did with his soulless metallic attachments. All cybernetics and bionics that the character had previously must be removed, including internal cybernetic implants. If doing so would normally result in the character’s death, such as in the case of a Bionic Respiratory System, the character must also take the Reformed Skin Talent to provide a life-saving replacement, permanently reducing his Toughness by 1d5 and Wounds by 1.

The effects of removing cybernetic implants is similar to sustaining [Critical Damage](injury%20and%20healing.md#serious%20injuries%20and%20conditions) and the Acolyte should be attended to by a trained medicae to reduce the risk of death from the process. Augmetics that provide additional specific effects, such as a mind impulse unit or bio-power cells, cease to do so once removed from the body. The character gains 1 additional Fate Point (up to a maximum of 5) for every two bionics that he has removed (with the exception of Mechadendrites). The character must remove each and every augmetic from his body before he receives this benefit, so characters with quite a few may need to spend considerable downtime recuperating between surgeries (allowing their Critical Damage to heal) before they increase their Fate Points. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank. The character counts as having the Gift of Purity Talent for the purposes of refusing new cybernetics.
#### **Talent: Reformed Skin**
For those Acolytes who prefer to remain whole physically as well as spiritually they may take on entirely new flesh to replace the hateful cybernetics that have been removed. A Cultist of the Pure Form may select this Talent as many times as he has missing limbs, senses, or organs—any human body part replaced with a cybernetic or lost due to Critical Damage.

When taken, the Acolyte gains a replacement body part reclaimed from a servitor or an executed criminal. The replacement is not a perfect analogue for the Acolyte's original flesh, however, and imposes the same penalties that a Poor Craftsmanship cybernetic would (and, obviously, does not confer a bonus to his Toughness or a reduced chance of death from Critical Effects). Superior examples, vat-grown in bioreactors to closely match the Acolyte's body, may be purchased for 75% the cost of a cybernetic replacement instead—these effectively duplicate the Acolyte's missing parts and impose no penalties on their use (but still doesn't grant any special benefits or effects that an augmetic part might).

Any Fate Points gained from the Purity of Flesh Talent are lost when the missing parts are replaced with Reformed Skin, so the pious cultist should consider carefully how much he's willing to go without when considering a flesh-crafted replacement. Unless the missing body part would lead to inevitable death, such as a bionic cardiac system, the Acolyte is under no obligation to actually take this Talent. Reformed Skin costs no xp to purchase, though there may be a cost in Thrones if the Acolyte wishes to utilise a better quality part. 
## **Daemonym Seeker**

*“The most ideal of conditions for defeating the daemon: be on a first-name basis.”*

— High Banisher Segrin, Ordo Malleus
### **Background**
Within the Collegia Exterminatus it is considered a blessing that summoning a powerful daemon  is not easy; it can take a lifetime of devotion and years of preparation. Generational cults of worship exist that have secretive agendas hidden behind layers of faithful rhetoric. However, banishing or controlling a daemon is a far less difficult task if the summoner or banisher possesses the True Name of the daemon.

The True Name of even the most minor daemon is a closely guarded secret among warp entities. Knowing the True Name of a daemon gives one considerable power over that daemon, any minions of that daemon, and possibly even its worshippers. Most daemons are known by a variety of pseudonyms, should they desire to be called anything at all. However, among those who would use occult knowledge against mankind's greatest foe, there are some who would seek out the True Name of a daemon; they are called the Daemonym Seekers.

When a daemon hunter wishes to become a Seeker, there is no training or ceremony; he simply begins to hunt for the name of a specific warp entity. This may be a daemon who has given his Inquisitor trouble in the past or simply a beast that caught his attention during the course of his normal studies. Whatever his reasons, the Seeker devotes himself completely to the pursuit of this daemon's True Name.

The path of the Daemonym Seeker is rooted in the work of Inquisitor Adorjin. She was a potent psyker, and employed a great number of Banishers. Many of her Banishers considered her one of their own, as she forsook luxuries and the prestige of her title to pursue daemons with fervent determination. Adorjin devoted much of her life to hunting one vicious and particularly powerful warp entity which had infamously left a trail of carnage and damnation across numerous worlds of Segmentum Obscurus. For nearly two centuries she studied the creature as she pursued it, learning its True Name amid the trail of ruination and suffering caused by the daemon's plots. Eventually tracking it to the Calixis Sector, she brought with her several Banishers who had studied with her, a powerful relic weapon, and an ancient copy of the *Liber Daemonica*. Though she fell in the battle, the daemon was banished back to the warp for another century before it could unleash its latest machination upon the unsuspecting people of Calixis. Her strategies were adopted by a great many Banishers, and she is revered with saint-like piety by many among the Ordo Malleus of the Calixian Conclave.

Daemonym Seekers employ every resource they can in their search for the names of daemons, from the study of ancient prophesy to dangerous séances. The majority of Seekers devote their entire careers to the study of a particularly fell daemon, declaring that monster their nemesis and often growing to be obsessed with the target of their study. Daemonym Seekers are rarely trusted by any but the most radical of Inquisitors, and indeed, more than a few Seekers have had their quests (and sometimes lives) cut short by more puritanical members of the Inquisition who did not approve of the dark path such a pursuit demands. The Puritans’ judgement is not unwarranted; there are instances where Seekers have attempted to harness a daemon for the benefit of the Imperium, but such a noble effort almost always ends in tragedy. Worse, a few have secretly grown
to respect or worship the daemon they obsess over, becoming (witting or otherwise) Chaos cultists in all but name and laying bare the inner workings of the Inquisition to one of its most treacherous and cunning foes.
### **Becoming a Daemonym Seeker**
To become a Daemonym Seeker is to take up the single-minded cause of exterminating a great evil from the galaxy. There is no ceremony; there are no badges of office. Once you have set out on the path to discover the True Name of a warp fiend, you have taken it upon yourself to become the hunter, dogging your prey wherever it might try to feast its abominable desires. It will not be long before the beast knows that you are its enemy.

**Required Career:** Adept or Cleric
**Required Experience:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

#### **Talent: Daemonym**
Daemonym is actually a series of Talents available to the Daemonym Seeker, reflecting the character's growing knowledge of the daemon's True Name and special training in how to use that name against the daemon. This is a difficult undertaking, as the True Name of a daemon is usually very long and quite complex—the more powerful and ancient the daemon, the longer and more incomprehensible the name. Pronunciation must be exact, and the name may even have a melody, requiring the name to be sung. The GM should create the Daemon, if there is not a suitable one already in the campaign, and careful planning should be taken with regards to the character's motivations and how this zealous pursuit will effect the game.
##### **Minor Daemonym**
The character has begun to understand the very basics of the subject's True Name, granting a certain level of control over the worshippers of the daemon. While the devoted cult may know nothing of the daemon's true nature they are still susceptible to coercion and subtle manipulation by those who do understand the nature of the beast. When dealing with cultists who are servants of the chosen daemon the character gains a +10 bonus to any Interaction Tests, and at the GM's discretion may be able to command them as if the cultists were his subordinates.
##### **Lesser Daemonym**
The Seeker now begins to understand the True Name of the daemon on a conceptual level, giving him a significant amount of power over it. Armed with part of the daemon's True Name, the Seeker can sap some of the fearsome strength away from their powerful foe. The character gains a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill Tests made to attack the daemon and any of its minions as well as a +10 bonus on any Tests made as part of a ritual against the daemon. Furthermore, any melee weapons counts as Sanctified against the daemon and its minions when the character wields it.
##### **Greater Daemonym**
The Seeker has mastery over his foe's True Name, understanding all its subtle nuances and pronunciation along with any other verbal or somatic cues needed to recite it. Within the Ordo Malleus puritans view this as pure heresy, whilst radicals see perhaps one of the most powerful weapons one can wield against the daemon. The character gains a +30 bonus to any Tests made as part of a ritual against the daemon, and may attempt to banish the daemon from the materium simply by repeatedly reciting its name (see Banishment below).

**Banishment:** As a Full Action the character makes a Literacy Test opposed by the daemon's Willpower. If the character succeeds reciting the daemon's True Name it suffers 1d10 Damage, plus another 1d10 for every degree of success the character achieves. This Damage is considered Sanctified, and is not reduced by the daemon's Armour (though it is reduced by Toughness). The Damage can be any type the GM deems appropriate. If the daemon is slain from Damage inflicted by Banishment it cannot return to the materium again for quite some time, and in any event is unlikely to cause the Acolytes any further trouble.

## **Demagogue**

*“You have been forsaken! You have been enslaved by lies, beaten by injustice, and bled by greed, but you have not bowed your heads or bent your knees. If it takes a thousand years and a river of blood, then so be it, but we will be free!”*

— Unidentified heretic on Tranch prior to the rising of the Pale Throng 
### **Background**
Demagogues are rabble rousers and agitators who can sway great crowds with their words. These fiery orators may be cult leaders, idealists, madmen, fanatics, or subtle manipulators and agent provocateurs. All, however, have the skill to draw crowds together with words, bind them with rhetoric, and loose them on a target like a pack of dogs. Worlds have burned because of the actions of such men and women. Some wish for nothing more than to see the world around them torn down and set aflame, to stoke the fires of anger and dissent to the point of an all-consuming inferno. Others are created by the injustices done to them or those around them, injustices that push the demagogue past the confines of society and into open insurrection against those in authority or anyone else the demagogue believes to have wronged them. Many Demagogues within the Imperium are touched with such conviction and faith that they use their skills to build crusades of the credulous and desperate.

Many, if not most, demagogues true believers, faithful and loyal to the Emperor in mind and action, but the consequences of their fomentations can be extremely dire for those in positions of power. Indeed, planet-wide sectarian conflicts, religious schism, and popular upheaval strong enough to threaten the Imperial tithe have all been started, likely quite unwittingly, by demagogues faithful to the Master of Mankind yet scorning of His temporal vassals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, to many Imperial authorities, these incendiary individuals are, for the most part, a menace whose activities must be controlled, and if necessary, curtailed—possibly with great and uncompromising force.

This is often more easily said than done. Rare is the Emperor-fearing demagogue who will willingly end their campaign of incitement under threats from authorities they already care little for in the first place. In some cases, productive negotiation has led to a cooling of tensions and a certain measure of redress for the demagogue's grievances, but this is more often the exception than the rule. Mutual animosity and irreconcilable differences have frequently led to short-sighted potentates having the demagogue silenced permanently, only to watch in horror as the demagogue's followers explode into completely uncontrollable revolt, anarchy, and destruction over their martyred leader's demise.

Persecuting recidivist demagogues, those who hold no great love for the Imperium or its institutions, can be even more of a thorny prospect. Many demagogues are adept at slipping through the Imperial society unseen and unaccounted for. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a recidivist demagogue to appear long enough to create a brushfire rebellion or riot, only to melt away when the authorities move against them and begin plans anew to replicate the destruction they have unleashed somewhere else. It matters not whether the demagogue is motivated by a personal conviction to see the forces and structure of ordered society burn, or if the act of inciting revolt is simply a profitable enterprise to be repeated for the demagogue's simple cupidity. These elusive agitators are the most dangerous and hunted variety of demagogue, and many are counted amongst the Calixis Sector's most notorious of rebels and heretics. 

Among Inquisitors of a less-puritanical mien a demagogue could be a very valuable asset. Some Inquisitors will train a demagogue in the art of incitement, effectively creating a rabble-rousing agent they can deploy where social unrest and disarray are needed. Others could be true recidivist demagogues co-opted by the Inquisition as a means of avoiding a far worse fate than instigating a crisis over a cause they don't believe in. Such "social" weapons are often deployed into situations where an Inquisitor has reason to believe the authority in question has fallen to corruption or heresy, but either lacks the means to prove it to the more staid Adeptus, or the unique circumstances of the situation preclude simply arresting or removing said authority by the Inquisitor's own prerogative.

It has been said by some (albeit in decidedly hushed tones) within the halls of Lord Hax's Lucid Palace that the mutant uprising on Tranch was the product of just such an Inquisitorial gambit. Sensing that the slowly growing unrest within Tranch's soot warrens would inevitably lead to an uprising against that world's feckless oligarchs, a handful of radical Recongregationist Inquisitors hatched a bold scheme. The Recongregationists, already entirely dismissive of the planetary authorities, believed that the mutant Shroud Masters of Tranch would use the uprising to launch a massive uprising of other mutants and abhumans across the entire Sector. 

Instead of trying to prevent the uprising in the first place—deemed to be a hopeless prospect in light of Tranch's brutal and deeply ingrained discord—the Recongregationists took several steps to deliberately accelerate the upheaval. This included sending in a cadre of trained demagogues explicitly to agitate the discontent of the soot warren dwellers. The scheme worked, and the world was in full revolt in a matter of months. The Shroud Masters, caught by surprise as the uprising they were carefully preparing suddenly and fiercely launched right out from under them, were not yet in a position to propagate the revolution to the other hive worlds of Calixis. Their master plan thwarted, the Shroud Masters scattered as the Imperial Guard retook the rebelling world spire by spire and hive by hive. Of no minor footnote, the larger body of the Inquisition ousted Tranch's surviving oligarchs, deeming them collectively guilty of such dereliction and incompetence as to have all but caused the revolt in the first place.

If this pernicious rumour is to be believed, the Recongregationists were broadly successful. The Shroud Masters' Sector-wide uprising was suppressed before it could begin, Tranch's inefficacious oligarchs were either killed or replaced, and Calixis had millions fewer mutants by the time the Imperial Guard regiments were being demobilised. Officially, the Inquisition has rigorously denied that any such scheme existed. This is just as well, as if there was any truth to it, the supposed Recongregationists would do well to keep their actions secret even from their peers. Even disregarding the millions of dead civilians and Guardsmen, the near-total destruction of Tranch's economy and much of its infrastructure brought about by a planetary revolt literally instigated by the radicals could have them accused of sedition, if not outright heresy.
### **Becoming a Demagogue**
Demagogues who serve radical Inquisitors usually assume the role through necessity. When you are charged with bringing blood and destruction or instigating fundamental changes in the structure of Imperial authority, the ability to create a riot, instigate a mutiny, and foment rebellion is useful indeed. Talented orators and socially adept Acolytes may embrace this role and dedicate themselves to perfecting its finer points, while some are thrust towards it by their master. While it is their best-known talent, demagogues are not limited to practising their social graces before large crowds, and any Acolyte cell could benefit from having a master of rhetoric and persuasion to aid them when the bullets and las blasts aren't flying. 

**Required Career:** Adept, Cleric, Imperial Psyker, or Scum

## **Frateris Militia**

*“My militia of faithful, you may not be clad in the blessed flak armour of the Imperial Guard. You may not bring the Emperor’s wrath through the barrel of the righteous lasgun. What you lack in the Imperium’s most blessed weapons of war you replace with fervour and faith. No army forged can stand before the might of the Emperor’s judgement wrought by our hands.”*

— Abbot Vonn Schtiel
### **Background**
Since the dark days of Sebastian Thor’s great reformation, the Ministorum has been prevented, by the dictates of the Decree Passive, from maintaining forces that consist of “men at arms.” Although this statute put an end to the vast standing armies of the ancient Ecclesiarchy, the archaic wording of the decree has been subjected to many abuses and creative interpretations over the centuries, and only a fool would assume that the Ecclesiarchy lacks military power.

In times of great need—wars of faith and crusades, but also revolts and disasters—Ecclesiastical authorities will arm its male servants, both from the clergy and the mass of lay followers. A great mass of clerks, Deacons, Pardoners, and other minor functionaries swarm from the great temples and cathedrals, armed with whatever weapons they can lay their hands upon. To some, they are nothing but a disorganised rabble, a greater threat to themselves than to any opposing force, but on many occasions a hastily-assembled Frateris Militia have been known to perform tremendous acts of courage and valour in the name of the Emperor. Though rarely mentioned by the remembrancers once the conflict has passed, more than a few worlds have been saved from xenos invasion and the forces of rebellion by the fervent defence of a legion of Ecclesiastical militiamen.

Members of the Frateris Militia are not professional soldiers, and receive no formal training in their role, although frontier diocese and those on politically unstable worlds have been known to drill their able-bodied clergy on basic military tactics (on a strictly unofficial basis, of course). However, their faith is strong, and what they lack in standardised equipment and manuals of arms they make up for with zeal to serve the God-Emperor.

One of the many legends of St. Drusus involves a close friend and confidant, Abbot Rempsi. As a young man Rempsi had been drafted into the Frateris Militia and joined the crusade to return the Calyx Expanse into the Imperial fold. He was a fiery orator whose rage was barely contained even when not surrounded by the bloodshed of combat. The survival rate of most Frateris Militia during the Angevin Crusade was poor by any standards, but Rempsi managed to survive a dozen conflicts before he met Drusus, providing spiritual counsel to the lay members and urging them on to great feats of bravery once the battle was enjoined.

According to the legend, while in transit to the next war zone a great warship carrying both Imperial Guard and Frateris Militia was assailed by blind, void-dwelling xenos which swarmed through the vessel's halls and atriums hungry for a meal of human flesh. Locked in a bulkhead with several dozen Frateris Militia, Drusus battled alongside Rempsi, holding the choke point leading to the enginarium. Eventually overrun, dozens of xenos rushed through the corridors and would soon overwhelm the enginarium and snuff out the ship's plasma cores. The young Rempsi bellowed with rage and disgust at the abominable force before him, and his militia followed him headlong towards the enemy, only to abruptly stop a few dozen metres short. Peaceful calm washed over them as they began to loudly recite the Litany of Refusal. Overwhelmed by the sonorous chanting, the xenos were repelled, unable to come within striking distance of the Frateris Militia and saving the ship. Drusus knew that he had witnessed a miracle. Abbot Rempsi was forever changed, his spittle-hurling rage replaced by steadfastness and serene determination in the will of the God-Emperor. Rempsi spent much of the rest of the crusade as one of Drusus' most phlegmatic and composed advisers, and is still revered today by the stoic and composed throughout the Sector.
### **Becoming a Frateris Militia**
Those who serve the Ecclesiarchy are often drafted into the Frateris Militia to serve in times of need. While not formally trained or given a wage as members of a proper military would be, they are excused from other official duties during their service. Anyone with strong loyalty to the Ecclesiarchy and a willingness to take up arms against mankind's enemies could have served in a Frateris Militia, and any Inquisitor worth his salt would value a man of faith who also happens to be proficient in combat as a member of an Acolyte cell.

**Required Career:** Adept, Cleric, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp).
**Militia Service:** A character who replaces Rank 1 with Frateris Militia also replaces all starting equipment with a Las Carbine or Hunting Rifle and 2 reloads, Aquila Necklace, a Charm, a Knife, a backpack and a Flak Vest.
**Brothers in Arms:** As the name implies, only male characters may become members of a Frateris Militia. With the (very) notable exception of the Adepta Soroitas, the Ecclesiarchy disdains the idea of expending women in combat.

## **Forsaken Priest**

*“Any grace that was mine is gone. I am a priest of a church of bones and all my flock are grinning skulls and ashes. I am no longer a man: I am a thing made of bleak knowledge, squandered purity and regret.”*

— Confessor Adso, Acolyte in the service of Inquisitor Antonia Mesmeri
### **Background**
It is a regrettable truth that even Clerics of the Adeptus Ministorum are not immune to crises of faith. A deacon witnessing his temple being obliterated by a hive quake, a preacher's entire congregation being butchered by ravening xenos, or worse, turning to heretical thought and abandoning the truth of the God-Emperor, can draw even the most faithful of priests to waver. For most, this is a momentary weakness, a lapse quickly corrected. There are a minority, however, for whom a seed of doubt is planted, and the Cleric's belief in the straight and narrow of the Imperial Creed begins to degrade.

Depending on the severity of the Cleric's descent into faithlessness, this moral failing may be revealed by their peers quite quickly, or could go years without being detected. The latter is especially vexatious to the Ecclesiarchy, as the dissolute Cleric's sermons are likely to have become at least peripherally contaminated by the Cleric's own diminishing conviction. Any Cleric whose faith is considered suspect by their peers will assuredly face investigation and some measure of censure, with especially severe punishments for those that have been willingly preaching apostasy to their parishioners.

Clerics in service of the Inquisition are no exception to this unfortunate reality, and while those in an Inquisitor's retinue are likely to be of sterner stuff than most, they are also more likely to witness spectacular horrors and mind-bending weirdness as well. If the Inquisitor becomes aware of their Cleric Acolyte's diminishing faith the Cleric is likely to face similar consequences to their cloistered fellows. For a particularly radical Inquisitor, however, a spiritually compromised Cleric could be more of an asset than a liability. These individuals have been known to be sought out by Oblationist and Xanthite members of the Inquisition's radical faction—often, a withering Cleric will be scooped up by Inquisitorial agents before their failings are discovered by the larger body of the Ecclesiarchy. Especially nefarious radicals, however, have been known to furtively "manufacture" their own candidates by intentionally challenging a Cleric Acolyte's faith until the poor soul has been broken down enough to consider a new way of thinking. 

Under the guidance of their Inquisitorial patron, so-called Forsaken Priests undergo a dark transformation, filling the void left in their hearts with proscribed knowledge of the profane. With ritual care the once-pure priest studies and practices the vile skills of warp craft, and in so doing is transformed from a priest of unsullied faith to a hollow shell who has nothing left but sacrifice and service to their master. Now a committed radical himself, the Forsaken Priest is forevermore wed to the Inquisition by both knowledge and deed—even with an Inquisitorial remit, the Ministorum would consider such an individual a monstrous apostate for whom death would be a mercy.

The bearing of a Forsaken Priest is largely dependent on whether they've been brought into the Oblationist or Xanthite folds. For Oblationists, the Forsaken Priests are an ultimate expression of their fanatical belief of spiritual self-sacrifice to wield fell weapons and malignant forces against mankind's great enemy. When they need a sorcerer in their service, they create them from the purest of sources: the best and most pious of the priests of the Adeptus Ministorum. These Clerics are long-serving and trusted Acolytes of an Oblationist who have accepted and embraced the self-annihilating creed of their master, and so have been charged to become a weapon against the enemies of the Imperium.

The Xanthites arrive at the same end goal but with an entirely different philosophical outlook. Their aim is to master and dominate the powers of the warp and bind them into mankind’s service, a deadly pursuit that requires women and men of unfailing will and vision to accomplish. To this end the Xanthites seek out and draw Clerics whose faith has been sorely tried or whose own creeds have strayed far from the Ministorum’s orthodoxy into their service, the better to slowly mould and shape to their own ends and to embrace the darkly visionary Xanthite ethos. Raised up in forbidden knowledge, these Forsaken Priests serve the Xanthite cause as trusted Acolytes, exorcists, and daemon-binders whose faith in the God-Emperor, though no less fervent than before, has changed as through a mirror darkly.
### **Becoming a Forsaken Priest**
The path of the Forsaken Priest is a profound change for a Cleric Acolyte, representing an undeniable shift into the Inquisition's radical faction, and very likely one of its most controversial sects at that. It also represents a progression of trust from the Cleric's Inquisitor, and must be carried out as a conscious choice on the part of both servant and master. For the Xanthites in particular, such an investiture is often a sign that the Acolyte's Inquisitor believes they may have what it takes to one day receive their own Rosette, and thus perpetuate the Xanthites' dark vision to a new generation of Inquisitorial henchmen.

Once a Cleric has set himself on the path of a Forsaken Priest, he will undergo a period of purification, prayer, and fasting alongside his schooling in the malefic arts. At the end of this period the Cleric will lose any Pure Faith-based Talents he may have acquired and gains 1d10 Corruption Points as he begins to thoroughly simmer in the works of his enemies.

**Required Career:** Cleric
**Required Experience:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

## **Ordo Sicarius Initiate**

"Some may be able to avoid the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites. Fewer may be able to face off against the Imperial Guard, and perhaps even the Adeptus Astartes. None can stand against the Officio Assassinorum."

— Tarik Ziz, Callidus Director Secundus
### **Background**
At the end of the Age of Apostasy and Goge Vandire’s despotic rule came a shadow conflict few have heard of and many participants did not survive: the Wars of Vindication within the Officio Assassinorum. The Officio had become riddled with corruption, and the Grand Master of Assassins was forced to kill many of its members in order to fully eliminate those still loyal to the deposed High Lord or who had fallen into irredeemable degeneracy during his rule. The Officio’s hierarchy was utterly shattered and needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, and for a time there was some discussion amongst the new High Lords that the Officio itself might be dissolved. 

As fellows of clandestine warfare, the Inquisition came to the Officio Assassinorum's aid during this moment of great peril. Following a thorough investigation and taking of accounts, Inquisitor Jaeger of the Ordo Hereticus deemed that a special order of the Inquisition would be created to help rebuild the Officio, and subsequently monitor and control some of its functions much more
closely than had occurred before. His proposal was accepted, and the Ordo Sicarius was created, with Jeager as its first Lord Inquisitor. As the Officio Assassinorum is a highly secretive branch of the Imperial hierarchy, Jeager and his henchmen understood that maintaining a typical hierarchy of control was out of the question. To preserve the Officio's ability to rive seamlessly through Imperial society the Ordo Sicarius would not maintain any formal structures outside it, instead fulfilling their duty by planting Assassin-Acolytes and, indeed, a few Inquisitors within their ranks. 

The masters of the Assassinorum know of the existence of these Ordo Sicarius agents, but not their number, postings, or individual identities. The Assassinorum and Sicarius follow an informal set of guidelines toward their unusual arrangement. Officially, the Officio Assassinorum does not attempt to expose or identify Sicarius agents, but those who are identified are marked and reported as such to their masters, who will withdraw and reassign the "made" agent. In return, if a Sicarius agent does uncover heresy or some dire conspiracy within the Assassinorum, the Ordo Sicarius will work in cooperation with the rest of the Officio to excise the malignant element with an absolute minimum disruption to their operations. Once a Sicarius agent is "made", his time secreted within the Officio Assassinorum is over, but the Inquisition has a great many other tasks that an expert at deception and guile could turn their hands to.

One notable example of the Ordo Sicarius' work dates from the early years of the 39th Millennium. Praetor Golgenna Angevin, a well-connected noble of the Terran Court, was raised to the rank of Lord Militant and granted a writ to prosecute a crusade to liberate and return the worlds of the Calyx Expanse to the Imperial fold. Among a cadre of Angevin's trusted counsellors and chamberlains was a man by the name of Dario Vereschagin. Unknown to Angevin or any of the others at the time, this servant was in actuality one Inquisitor Treyus Godan of the Ordo Sicarius. Inquisitor Godan's purpose was to monitor Angevin's crusade and to determine, on behalf of the Inquisition, whether or not such a singularly powerful individual was still loyal to the Imperium and faithfully executing the duties he was charged with. If he was not, then it was Godan's duty to eliminate him before Angevin turned the vast forces of the Crusade towards his own ends. A number of members of the Inquisition were openly serving in the forces of the Crusade, and could ostensibly fulfil the same purpose as Godan, but if the Lord Militant did betray the Imperium these badge-wearing agents and Inquisitors could conceivably be eliminated, or worse, co-opted. Godan, then, could serve as an additional measure to guarantee Angevin's loyalty. 

As the Crusade entered its third and final stage, Godan personally witnessed Angevin's acclaimed General Drusus slain by a rogue assassin. When Drusus rose from the dead, Godan was one of the first of the Crusade's leaders to recognise him as a living saint, a sure sign that the God-Emperor had blessed the Crusade's success with His divinity. Capitalising on this moment, Godan "revealed" himself as an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and officially (albeit without any sort of formal authorisation) declared the Inquisition's support of the new living saint. Reinvigorated by this moment of holy righteousness (and significant resources diverted by Inquisitorial forces) the Crusade barrelled ahead with newfound vigour, and most of the remaining worlds of Calyx were returned to the God-Emperor's light not long thereafter. Critically, by making the resurrection of Drusus a matter of Inquisitorial import, the conspirators who had him assassinated were outed, and the possibility of a religious schism over whether Drusus was truly a living saint or not was quickly put to rest before it could threaten the Crusade's revitalised momentum.

Godan, for his part, was censured for impersonating an Inquisitor, but received clemency in light of the undeniable results of his duplicity, and disappeared from the record shortly thereafter. Only a few within the Inquisition ever knew Godan was a member of the Ordo Sicarius, much less had been clandestinely monitoring the Crusade's progress and guiding the hands of its leaders the entire time. To this day, even many within the Holy Ordos are only vaguely aware of the existence of the Sicarius in the first place, but few would doubt their capability at deception and the crafting of cover identities for deep infiltration. Inquisitors whose work entails delicate and surreptitious investigation are often pleased to have an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius in their service, although some might give pause to the notion that the Sicarius-trained Acolyte could be keeping tabs on them at the same time...
### **Becoming an Ordo Sicarius Initiate**
Becoming an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius is no simple feat. The Acolyte in question must be both a skilled warrior and very capable at subterfuge. The vast majority of its members were chosen for induction by Assassin-Inquisitors of the Ordo Sicarius itself, the prospective initiates merely given a dataslate with the name of a target, and a stated goal of "Interrogation and Extermination required" written underneath. How, or even if, the prospect goes about this mission is his decision. Assuming the assignment is successfully completed, and the work is judged to be adequate, the prospect is clandestinely taken to the Ordo Sicarius' main temple and begins his training in the ways of the Assassin-Inquisitors.

## **Redemptionist**

*“There are none above redemption at the end of a Chainsword. Should I fall, it is because it is my sublime reward to have been chosen for absolution by the God-Emperor.”*

— Redeemer Cosler
### **Background**
The Imperial Creed is generally not a forgiving doctrine of faith, but those who observe it in the strictest and most fundamental way possible know that redemption is only found in death. Many seek their own redemption on the battlefield for the sins they have committed against the God-Emperor—the Redemptionist seeks to bring redemption to others. Many Redemptionists find one sin particularly offensive and seek any opportunity to bring final salvation to aliens, heretics, those who consort with profane powers, and all matters of other sinners and degenerates.

Redemptionists will often congregate in cults whose focus of hatred is similar. In the beginning, such groups are often little more than a disorganised and shabby rabble, congregating in public squares and watering houses to denounce sinners and loudly proclaim the wickedness of those around them. If a cult manages to find purchase it will begin to swell its numbers, attracting more angry, often downtrodden or disaffected members of society looking for an outlet for their frustrations. The cult's leaders, known as Redeemers, are quick to welcome such lost souls into the fold, enlightening them to the true causes of their suffering and how they can find purpose as a holy warrior for the God-Emperor. As the cult grows in strength it will begin to undertake increasingly bold (and destructive) crusades, often rapidly progressing from vandalism to arson to outright armed conflict against any groups they deem heretical or blasphemous—which is many!

The established organs of the Ecclesiarchy have an inconstant relationship with Redemptionist cults. As a cult grows it is not uncommon for deacons and bishops to furtively arm or otherwise aid the cult's efforts, viewing their pugnacious crusades against degenerate holo-theaters, narco gangers, and mutant enclaves as a valuable form of social "housekeeping". The propensity for innocents to be swept up in a Redemptionist purge, along with the ever-increasing collateral damage to infrastructure, makes any kind of official sanction unlikely. Large groups of Redemptionists, whipped into frenzies of ecstatic destruction, are known to pose a serious threat to stable populations. The task at hand is never truly done in their eyes—if all of the mutants are purged, it is a great day for the faithful, but now all those who aided or tolerated them must be purged. All those who failed to fight the mutants must then be purged, then all those who might fail in the future, and so on. City and even planetary authorities must often begin to suppress a highly successful Redemptionist cult before the frenzied need to put the blasphemous to the pyre spreads out of control and hurls the entire world into anarchy. Clever, if amoral, leaders will attempt to redirect the Redemptionists' righteous wrath, finding a new target (preferably off-world) for them to sink their chainswords into. If that isn't possible, or if the Redeemers' zealotry starts directing their incendiary mobs against the Ecclesiarchy itself, the clerical leaders will often be forced to make the very painful decision to forcibly break up the cult before the grip of the Imperial Church itself is threatened.

Once a Redemption cult is "stoked down" most of its rank-and-file firebrands will return to their menial existences, while the true zealots will often scatter back into society to begin the work of fomenting a new purge later. The Redeemers are usually rounded up for questioning—the most fanatical and fractious are likely to be exiled or executed (especially those who've turned their rage against the Ministorum), while those deemed to be subordinable to Ecclesastic authority may be pulled into the church to put their incendiary talents to use for its betterment. During such times, as the rubble and the cremated remains of blasphemers, mutants, and sinners are swept up, shadowy organisations—clandestine cabals within the Ecclesiarchy, death cults, and, naturally, the Inquisition—will often try to recruit the most capable Redemptionists into their service. 

Zealous Inquisitors, especially those of the Ordo Hereticus, are often quite keen to bring such a firebrand into their retinues. As long as the Redemptionist can be trusted to follow orders and respect the supreme authority of his master, an Acolyte cell could greatly benefit from such an unwaveringly righteous warrior's martial prowess and piousness to the God-Emperor. Aside from recruiting Redemptionist Acolytes, an Inquisitor might also assemble, often surreptitiously, small groups of former Redemptionists to act as an unsubtle burning cudgel. These disposable zealots can be set upon organisations the Inquisitor has deemed to be heretical but, for whatever extenuating circumstance, cannot act against directly. Alternatively, they could just used as a simple distraction whilst the Inquisitor's own Acolytes do the more delicate work of bringing the heretics to justice.
### **Becoming a Redemptionist**
A strict adherence to the vengeful spirit of the Imperial Creed is the first step down the road of the Redemptionist. Faithful communities from all across the Imperium of Man produce Redemptionists and their cults. Many don the red robes and take up the chainblade and the flamer as a response to the perception of sin and moral decay all around them—an attitude the Redeemers will eagerly encourage. Others come up in religious communities, often in monasteries and other insular Ecclesastical holdings, that preach the Redemption as a normal aspect of the Imperial Creed, and lived their entire lives knowing that it is only a matter of time before the wicked can be put to the torch. In the main, the only true requirement is a powerful affirmation in the divine supremacy of the God-Emperor and a burning desire to castigate any whose faith is questionable.

**Required Career:** Assassin, Guardsman, or Cleric
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp)
**True Believer:** Redemptionists care little for wealth, spending more time in prayer and plotting the destruction of sinners than building social clout. The character is considered Supine Class for the purposes of determining monthly income.
**Holy Instruments:** A character who replaces Rank 1 with the Redemptionist Alternate Career Rank also replaces Basic Weapon Training (Primitive) and Thrown Weapon Training with Melee Weapon Training (Chain) and Basic Weapon Training (Flame). If the character has the Redemptionist Firebrand Background Package they also replace their starting equipment with a chainsword, flamer, and shield robes.

#### **Talent: Chain Weapon Expert**
**Prerequisites:** Melee Weapon Training (Chain)

The character knows that fear is for the enemy and wrath is for the faithful. When wielding a Chain weapon that has a chance of striking the user, such as an Eviscerator, the user deftly turns the blade to its side after the swing and only takes his Strength Bonus in Impact Damage rather than the weapon’s full Damage when he hits himself. He reduces this Damage as normal with Armour and Toughness Bonus.
#### **Talent: Flame Weapon Expert**
**Prerequisites:** Basic Weapon Training (Flame)

The character is intimately familiar with the use of Flame weapons and likely has some burn scars to prove it. The character treats all Flame weapons as if they had the Reliable quality.
## **Saboteur**

*"Any problem in the world can be solved with the careful application of high explosives. The trick is not to be around when they go off."*

— Attributed to an ancient Terran warlord
### **Background**
 It is said by some of the more philosophically-minded Administratum thralls that everything within the Imperium is connected by endless invisible threads of interdependence, a vast web of commerce, trade, and movement of men that binds the whole together. From the astropathic messages brought to the table of a lord, to the food eaten by the lowest worker in a forge, all depends on something else to exist, and those in turn on other things. These threads of reliance form a vast entanglement of power and stability on which order, faith, and indeed survival itself depends. It is the destruction of these threads that is the Saboteur’s purpose, and for many, their most beloved art.

Saboteurs are craftsmen of panic, destruction, and downfall—sometimes all three at once! They are the loosed dogs of secret wars of destabilisation and terror that rage in the shadows of the Imperium of Mankind. Trained to move unseen amongst the great flocks of humanity, the Saboteur is a faceless agent of fear, mayhem, and death that attacks the physical and psychological fabric that binds the Imperium together. Many act as tools or proxies of larger conspiracies, sowing fear among the people and crippling the local authorities' means to resist the hideous plans of the Saboteur's employers. Others ply their trade for their own goals alone, seeking to topple institutions and spires out of personal animus for the rulers and powerful, or even just for the perverse joy of destruction itself.

Acolytes of the Inquisition are most likely to encounter a Saboteur in the course of an investigation, and will almost certainly be attempting to thwart the Saboteur's plans before they can threaten the very fabric of Imperial society. Yet, it is also not unheard-of for such cold monsters of terror to be found in the service of an Inquisitor. While unconventional in the main, it is true that grand conspiracies and heretical sects often depend on their own networks of information and material to enact their vile plots. Once uncovered, these can be severed with explosives and other clandestine, underhanded tactics just as easily, if not more so, than with a Storm Trooper deployment or a raid by an Arbites Suppression Squad. 

Sometimes a very deeply-rooted heresy can corrupt planetary authorities to its will or ephemerally secret itself within local institutions, becoming all but undetectable to even the all-seeing eye of the Inquisition. In such situations, a more radical Inquisitor might set loose Saboteur Acolytes to destabilise those very organisations, depriving the heretics of the facade of normality and pushing them out into the open. The cost in both infrastructure and innocent lives is often high, but those who would deliberately send an entire hive into anarchy to expose dire conspiracies within its guild halls and enforcer forts are quick to point out that a more "conventional", that is to say brute force, approach would likely be even worse.
### **Becoming a Saboteur**
A Saboteur's qualifications are deceptively simple: move surreptitiously and cause a great deal of targeted destruction. A Saboteur Acolyte will often lean on the training and institutional knowledge of his existing Career to identify structural and organisational weaknesses, areas where a little explosives or poison gas will have outsize effects on the body he's been called to cripple. No two Saboteurs are alike, and such an Acolyte is just as likely to be a dutiful servant calmly practising a trade for his master as he is to be a barely-contained menace, gleefully terrorising his fellow men with official justification that's often entirely too flimsy.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp).

## **Slate-Agent**

*"And who am I to be this year, hmm? A wealthy functionary in a dubious merchant guild? No? Hmm, perhaps a pampered Ecclesiastic keeping watch for detestable heresy within a suspect sect? Still no, eh? Well then, can I spend the majority of this mission indoors at least? Another Imperial Guard unit? How do heretics keep managing to sneak into those! Well at least I won't remember any of it after retrieval..."*

— A Slate-Agent, currently named Cavel Posdanik
### **Background**
On the planet of Malfi, a place often considered the "second capital" of the Calixis Sector, the men and women of the ruling class play a vicious game of politics and favour. This game is played not on any game-board, but in every palace, mansion, and villa. It is not played with pieces, but with the livelihood of their dynasties. The strategy of this game lies with political manoeuvring and favourable alliances. The stakes of this game are neither bragging rights nor pride, they are the very existence of the noble family, and the rights of rulership. The greatest advantage in this game of political infighting is information, preferably that which could shame and discredit a rival. In the pursuit of this sort of information the noble houses of Malfi have each developed methods particular to their own dynasty. It was for this purpose that the first Slate-Agents were trained. The Malfian house which first created the Slate-Agents is long forgotten, whether fallen to obscurity or risen to heights beyond all recognition, none can say. What is well known, however, is the efficacy of the Slate-Agent as a spy and operative. The secrets of creating a Slate-Agent escaped the Malfian backstabber-lords over a century ago, and other powerful organisations in Calixis — namely the Inquisition and the Adeptus Arbites — are known to employ these unique savant-moles for deep undercover work.

Masters of subterfuge and disguise, each Slate-Agent is a perfect operative of infiltration and observation. It is the gruelling process of their creation which makes a Slate-Agent so optimally crafted for their intended job. The first stage of a Slate-Agent's conditioning is aimed at wholly annihilating any sense of self possessed by the recruit, reducing them to little more than a biological machine in the service of their masters. It is from this state that Slate-Agents receive  heir moniker, as from this point forward, each Agent is a "blank-slate" on which new identities can be written. To achieve this, recruits are deprived of sleep, food, water, and dignity, as well as forced to endure horrific psychological torments, all the while they are watched for signs of opposition or rebelliousness. Once the recruit has been reduced to an entirely pliant and workable state, the trainers begin the slow process of rebuilding their charge. Using incredibly complex and methodical hypno-indoctrination techniques they prepare the recruit's mind to take shape around cover-identities, each of which includes skills, history, profession, and contacts, as well as personality and mannerisms, all combined to provide a flawless cover for the Slate-Agent. The trainers use psycho-conditioning to thread the recruit's psyche with triggers and fail-safes, in order to reset the conditioning once their mission is complete. Oft-times the conditioning of Slate-Agents is so complete that during their missions they are wholly unaware of their true identity until their loyalty is tested, at which point, deep-planted hypno-barriers close off the mind to any possibility of traitorous or mutinous thoughts.

Gathering information about one's target is the primary directive of each Agent. Infiltrating a targeted organisation, gaining access to its members' most heavily guarded secrets, and leaving no doubt as to their unfaltering loyalty to their target, these are the core objectives of each Slate- Agent's mission. The specifics may change depending on the Slate-Agent's controller and his targeted organisation, but information is the primary stock and trade of the Slate-Agent. For Malfian agents, having an ally so flawlessly inserted into an enemy's ranks often proves a dangerous temptation, for it is a simple thing to include a kill-order alongside the multitude of mundane orders during the templating process. This form of assassination is harshly frowned upon by the Malfian courts, although only because it would swiftly become a form of mutually assured destruction were this practice to become accepted. For Slate-Agents employed by other organisations, of course, there's often far less hesitation to deploy such an operative for both intelligence-gathering and murder should the opportunity arise.

Malfian Slate-Agents are often considered to be costly but ultimately disposable tools of espionage, meant to be deeply secreted within a rival house to feed information to their masters for as long as possible. Given the ever-changing nature of Inquisitorial work, those Slate-Agents who have been conditioned for use by agents of the Inquisition are often more aware of their true identity, at least subconsciously, and have even been known to have been templated with a multitude of identities at the same time. Slate-Agents in the employ of an Inquisitor can be seen as more of a deck of cards, able to flawlessly shift into a different cover identity as the needs of the mission dictate. This makes them an exceptional weapon to infiltrate corrupt organisations and heretical cults, and unlike the Malfian power-players, the Inquisition is absolutely not above utilising a Slate-Agent to terminate key members of a group they've been secreted into.
### **Becoming a Slate-Agent**
There is no set procedure by which men and women are chosen to become Slate-Agents. Functionally a softer form of mind-cleansing, the process is still painful and harrowing, and only the most absolutely devoted, penitent, or deranged would wholly volunteer to undergo the templating. Many Slate-Agents are coerced into the role by their masters, while others are all but forced to be "slated" as a form of penance for a severe failure. Inquisitors with a more whimsical idea of justice have been known to compel spies who have been caught infiltrating Inquisitorial properties or organisations to accept becoming a Slate-Agent. This allows the outsider to turn their existing talents at subterfuge to the Inquisition's benefit while giving a very effective guarantee of their loyalty to their new masters.

Upon becoming a Slate-Agent, the character gains the **Blank Slate Trait**.

**Required Career**: Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** [Unremarkable](talents.md#unremarkable) Talent
#### **Trait: Blank Slate**
The Acolyte is imprinted with several psychic triggers, known only to his handler. These triggers serve as prompts for the Slate-Agent’s identity programming. One trigger wipes the Slate-Agent’s mind clean of previous imprinting. Another prepares the Agent’s mind for re-programming. When a Slate-Agent is imprinted, the GM and the player may choose three [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore), [Forbidden Lore](skills.md#forbidden%20lore), [Scholastic Lore](skills.md#scholastic%20lore), or [Trade](skills.md#trade) Skills appropriate for the Acolyte’s cover identity. Until the Agent’s imprinting is wiped clean, the Slate-Agent is considered to possess all chosen Skills, and gains a +10 bonus on related Tests.

While an Acolyte's cover identity is "active" the Acolyte completely and totally believes himself to be that person, and even successful [Interrogation](skills.md#interrogation) will only reveal details about the Acolyte's templated persona. Psychic Powers such as [Mind Scan](telepathy.md#mind%20scan) will still reveal the Acolyte's actual identity and the fact that he's had a different identity templated onto him, however. The Acolyte loses all memories of his time under the active cover identity once the trigger is given to wipe his templating, so it is absolutely essential to fully debrief the Slate-Agent before attempting to prepare a new cover identity.

The triggers used to prepare and wipe a Slate-Agent's persona templates must remain absolutely secret, known only to the controller. Should the triggers become known to anyone else that party could implant their own template onto the Slate-Agent, possibly turning him against his masters or to some other no-doubt nefarious purpose.

## **Tyrantine Shadow Agent**

*"Lest the truth devour all."*

— Memento Mori of Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos
### **Background**
The Inquisition, some say, is an empire of secrets. To outsiders, this is certainly the case, for in stern judgement and shrouded in mystery the Holy Ordos sit above them like wrathful gods, little understood and rightly feared. But what is not so widely known by outsiders is that there are many secrets the Inquisition keeps from its own, either because it is expedient to do so, or because they are simply too dangerous even for some members of the Ordos to know. These secrets are often held through invisible webs of patronage, fealty and alliance, but sometimes manifest themselves though shadow empires: whole organisations hidden under the wider umbrella of the Holy Ordos whose nature and concerns remain mysterious even to other Inquisitors and Acolytes.

Inside the Calixian Conclave, there is no greater divider than the Hereticus Tenebrae, more informally known as the Tyrant Star, and the Tyrantine Cabal is one such secretive and insular group striving to uncover the true nature of its menace. The supreme danger of the Star is not known to all even within the Inquisition’s own ranks. Even those who do know something rarely have anything but a piece of the puzzle, and there are many who dismiss the calamitous phenomena of the Tyrant Star as mere coincidence or superstitions. In no small part, the Tyrantine Cabal is responsible for maintaining this ignorance, just as much as it is investigating what the Hereticus Tenebrae represents and how to combat it.

As the years have progressed, this web of secrecy and control has taken on a life almost of its own, and methods and agencies have sprung up to support it and its master’s goals. One such powerful agency is the Tenebrae Collegium—a shadow empire all of its own founded by the cynical genius of the renowned Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. The Collegium takes the most promising and suitable of Acolytes and transforms them into subtle and lethal instruments of deception, whose true allegiances can remain secret even from the Inquisitors they serve. These Acolytes are perfectly suited to keeping the Tyrantine Cabal's purposes hidden and enacting its will without remorse or apprehension. The existence of the Collegium and its so-called “shadow agents” is a matter officially denied by the Cabal and the source of much secret debate, suspicion, and contentious enmity within the Conclave Calixis as a whole. How far does its reach stretch? How many agents does it have? And what darkness might go undiscovered lurking at the heart of such a strange and hidden power? Few know, but many outside the Cabal have grave misgivings, and it is entirely likely that its most entrenched detractors have fashioned their own secret networks to oppose the Tyrantines' scheming.

It is said Cassilda Cognos once quipped, in a moment of levity, that the Collegium “took outstanding dissemblers and accomplished liars and then began their work”. Certainly, the results of the Collegium’s conditioning do produce agents more than capable of moving through the Imperium in a carefully woven fog of falsity and misdirection. Using tiny gestures, key words and cadences, two agents can communicate vital information in the presence of others who remain none the wiser. Furthermore, using psychic and mental conditioning, a graduate of the Collegium can close his mind to all but the most destructive psychic probing, concealing his deepest secrets around a labyrinth of half truths and falsity to confuse, making them not only extraordinarily proficient spies and agents, but near-impregnable living vaults for the secrets of the Cabal.

The ultimate purpose of these Tyrantine agents is to firstly hold the Cabal above all other masters, to pursue knowledge of the Tyrant Star, and to keep that knowledge safe from all outside the Cabal’s covetous circle. In most cases, these goals coincide with the agent’s duties as Acolytes of the Ordos Calixis. However, where their true loyalties have come into conflict with the Adepta or even immediate superiors outside of the Cabal, this has led to cold and brutal conflict with those the agent would ordinarily call their lords, comrades, or even friends. So far, the Cabal has managed to keep all such “difficulties” from wider knowledge. The time may come, though, when the fate of all is at stake and they will have to act no matter what the cost. Perhaps a civil war will erupt within the Ordos Calixis as a result. This is a nightmare, however, that this secret empire, this order within an order, must bear, for their own fearful secrets are as nothing to the dangers of the Hereticus Tenebrae, and some must be sacrificed lest its truth devour all.
### **Becoming a Tyrantine Shadow Agent**
The path of the Tyrantine Shadow Agent is to be a spy among spies, his true loyalties hidden from his ostensible master. Shadow Agents are always vigilant for any new information about the Tyrant Star they can acquire, and then just as driven to jealously guard it from the prying eyes of those outside the Cabal. By default this demands the Shadow Agent conspire against the trust of his master and his fellow Acolytes, keeping his ultimate objectives hidden from any not deemed worthy of the Cabal's dread knowledge. An Acolyte being revealed as a Shadow Agent would face formal censure from their Inquisitor at best, and could suffer a far worse fate if their master is a more vindictive or covetous soul. For those who maintain their clandestine charge, however, loyal service to their true masters will in time reward them with ascension to the Cabal's inner ranks, and with it, the terrible insight of the threat posed by the Hereticus Tenebrae.

Taking this Alternate Career Rank is not just a matter of passing the xp requirements, it means that you have been singled-out by the Tyrantine Cabal to advance their hideously secretive ambitions. Advancing into this Career makes you a conspirator and subject to the Tyrantine Cabal’s secret orders and goals, and should only be selected if the contrivances of the Tyrant Star figure in to the development of your campaign. As always, consult with your GM and determine whether this Alternate Career Rank is appropriate.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

## **Warp Dabbler**

*"She would have been just a petty recidivist and peddler of harm, one of countless souls of no great worth, but then the warp found her, and she became a true monster. However, as she is a monster loyal to me, you and I are now in conflict."*

— Radical Inquisitor Soldevan to Judge Hiram Fulk of the Adeptus Arbites
##### **Background**
Warp Dabblers, sometimes referred to as warplocks and petty sorcerers, are individuals tampering—often quite nesciently—with the malignant arts of the warp sorcery. Whether cultists, noncompliants, recidivists, or amoral academics, these individuals have had contact with forbidden knowledge and have decided to further explore the possibilities it can offer. These are not true sorcerers or savants of the forbidden, but instead are dark-hearted warriors, soiled enforcers, spiteful adepts, and twisted killers who have acquired a degree of warp lore and have made the perilous decision to put it into use for their own gain. Although they may never achieve the terrible heights of occult power and knowledge that the true masters of sorcery can, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing—especially in the hands of often-desperate individuals on the fringes of society.

Warp Dabblers may have walked almost any path before they begin their dalliance with warp craft. In the case of recidivists and other minor heretics, they may be cultists, criminals, smugglers, or even gang bosses. Others could, at least nominally, be on the straight and narrow, including lesser academics, occultists, and even noble scions. The intelligence and strength of will to study the forbidden is not something that all can do, but should one with the potential be presented with tantalisingly proscribed power, he will often seize it and put it to imaginative (and horrible) use.

Blessedly, the sorts of fell knowledge that could start one down the path of the Warp Dabbler are not easy to obtain. The Imperium is, in general, an insular and ignorant society, and this is just as much by design as it is by cultural norms. The Ecclesiarchy constantly preaches rhetoric designed to inspire dogmatic obedience and abject abhorrence of the heretical and the unknown in equal measure, while the Imperial Inquisition considers censoring and limiting the spread of information considered dangerous or corrupting an absolutely vital task. To the average Imperial citizen, a formal education in academic subjects is a luxury, daemons are distant horrors portrayed in morality plays, and the warp is more of an abstraction of antipathetic feelings than a very real place of unadulterated power and anarchy.

In this social climate, it is onerous to say the least to obtain texts or information about daemonology, the occult, and the immaterium, but it is by no means impossible either. There are few things more consistent in human nature than the desire to possess that which is proscribed or
unobtainable. In the darkest corners of Imperial society—and often its loftiest heights too—banned texts, forbidden tomes, and other instructions in warp craft can be bought, traded, and stolen by someone with the right connections or resources. Tragically, some even find their way into the hands of completely unwitting souls who, in a moment of weakness, turn away from the Ecclesiarchy's blessed ignorance and furtively turn the pages of madness and damnation.

It is an unfortunate irony that the Imperium’s tireless efforts to suppress perilous malefic knowledge mean those who do manage to obtain such information often have little real understanding of just how dangerous it can be. To them, the rituals and incantations are just another tool to obtain their goals, or worse, an amusing frivolity with the supernatural bearing no great significance at all. Only when it is far, far too late, and the leering eyes and grinning mouths of thirsting gods are upon him, does the average Warp Dabbler realise how profoundly his actions have doomed him.

This is not to say, however, that Warp Dabblers are not formidable foes. On the contrary, those who survive long enough, avoiding detection by the Imperial authorities and destruction or insanity from the dread tomes they ply, often possess a combination of low cunning, resourcefulness, and ruthless connivance which makes them quite competent adversaries. In addition, the warp-fueled powers and daemonic allies they can draw on makes them even more dangerous, especially when cornered or desperate. Warp Dabbling crime bosses may take down their rivals with horrors summoned from the warp, while assassins may use sorcery to pass unseen and so eliminate the most heavily guarded of targets with ease. Cultists may attract their followers with forbidden pleasures and dark rewards, while protecting their secrecy with hexes and malefic curses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Warp Dabbler is thus a common quarry for servants of the Inquisition, a burgeoning moral threat who grows in power and danger every day he's left to further hone his hideous craft.

For Inquisitors of a more radical persuasion, cornering a Warp Dabbler who isn't already "too far gone" could be a profitable prospect. A Warp Dabbling Acolyte can call on his knowledge of the dark arts to defeat his opponents, gain a better understanding of their motives and operations, or even bend the powers of the warp against its own vile denizens when they manifest in the materium. When facing the prospect of execution, or worse, few Warp Dabblers would reject a radical Inquisitor's sanction to make something worthwhile of their lives, and with it, perhaps earn redemption in the eyes of the God-Emperor.
### **Becoming a Warp Dabbler**
An Acolyte requires both motive and opportunity to become a Warp Dabbler. At a minimum, the Acolyte must have a source from which he could acquire profane knowledge of the warp, along with the necessary moral flexibility to heedlessly study such subjects and their dire portents. The Acolyte’s Inquisitor might be a source of such possibility, as could contact with warp cults or forbidden tomes, perhaps made during the course of an investigation. Once the Acolyte chooses to dabble in the proscribed, he must spend an amount of time studying or being tutored—usually taking a few months, although a fast reader could conceivably do it quicker—during which time the Acolyte gains 2d10 Corruption Points.

Note that this Alternate Career Rank is intended to represent a more surface-level or casual understanding of the malignancy that is the warp. For Acolytes partaking in true academic study of the immaterium and what lies within, see the [Malefic Scholar](alternate%20career%20ranks.md#malefic%20scholar) Alternate Career Rank.

## **Witchfinder**

*"I will find out the truth for you. Have no fear, friends."*

— Witchfinder Vincent Reeves to a cadre of suspected witches
##### **Background**
The teachings of the Adeptus Ministorum can provide immense comfort to oppressed humanity. They are often couched in terms that can appeal to the meanest understanding, with appeals to hope and faith in the darkest of times. At the same time, they can also be vituperative and hateful, inflaming billions of fanatics against the enemies of the Imperium. This outpouring of righteous ire unites humanity against its darkest foes, but such driving passion is not without risks of its own. Internecine conflicts between sects can arise over minor doctrinal points. Pilgrims riot over access to holy sites. Restless populations overthrow planetary governors, and the Pax Imperialis is threatened. In the main, the Ecclesiarchy is generally content to allow these moments of religious fervour to "work themselves out", willing to dismiss a certain amount of collateral damage as an unfortunate necessity of keeping the faith. Far worse are the heretics and the apostates who threaten the very souls of the Imperial citizenry. The Ordo Hereticus of the Inquisition uses its vast influence and resources to root out cults that corrupt the populace.

Puritan Inquisitors of the Ordo Hereticus and the Ecclesiarchy are often common bedfellows, sharing much in the way of philosophical outlook and what threats face the souls of mankind. The warrior-nuns of the Adepta Soroitas, formally an Ecclesiastical organisation, serves as the Chamber Militant of the Ordo Hereticus, and many Hereticus Inquisitors are apt to keep confessors and exorcists in their retinues to maintain the spiritual health of their Acolyte networks. To these souls, the danger of the unsanctioned psyker—colloquially, a witch—is one of the most dire. Such individuals are due to the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, intended to be spirited away on a blackship to Holy Terra so they may be judged if they can handle the psyker's great and terrible gift. The Monodominants of the Inquisition's puritan faction, however, would be quite content to have the lot of them consigned to the pyre, and these bold Inquisitors have no shortage of allies in the Calixian Ministorum who believe "abhor the witch" should not come with exceptions.

The Witchfinder is the human form of this meshed interest between the Inquisition's Monodominants and the Ecclesiarchy. Some come to hear this calling during their service to the Ordo Hereticus, realising the horrendous danger rogue psykers can pose to society and seeking special remit and training to persecute such wretches. Many, however, have been groomed from the day they swore allegiance to an Inquisitor, a steady partnership between the Ministorum and the Inquisition throughout the Acolyte's career, all for the purpose of producing a zealous and dogged hunter of witches. Any puritan Inquisitorial agent, and indeed many of the radicals too, would proclaim their hatred of the rogue psyker, but an Acolyte so invested as a Witchfinder harbours no other agendas or machinations—as long as witches draw breath, the Witchfinder pursues them relentlessly.

Witchfinders all start from a similar point in their labours, but tend to be quite unique individuals. Unlike many within the Inquisition, the Witchfinder does not conceal his charge. Drawn from the ranks of especially pious priests of the Ecclesiarchy, the Witchfinder uses his charisma and rhetorical graces to stoke and then direct the wrath of the faithful to expose, denounce, and often punish unsanctioned psykers in their midst. Most maintain a strong flair for theatrics, making their holy work a sort of community affair. Brazen in their use of religious iconography and texts, well-travelled and smooth talking, the Witchfinder takes special gratification in putting together showy trials where the accused witch's guilt can be proven to their fellows. Rapid-fire accusations, obscure evidences and liturgical justifications, and often-horrific physical trials and tests—these are the Witchfinder's most powerful weapons. 

Typically, the Witchfinder is already perfectly convinced of the witch's guilt (such investigation is done before the public trial even begins), but the kitschy event goes on as a spectacle for the citizens. The Witchfinder will call witnesses and air their testimony to those in attendance, keeping the common attendees engaged in the process and sharing in the apparent responsibility for the witch's inevitable demise. Although the Witchfinder is likely to wear an Inquisitorial badge of office, he is far from the nightmarish apparition spoken of in hushed tones that many common citizens associate with the word "Inquisitor". Colourful, outspoken, and stagy, the citizens might view a Witchfinder as terrifying or charming (possibly both), but above all else he is seen as a protector, someone who has their best interests in mind.

At its core, the Witchfinder's art is theatre and drama. The witch trials provide the masses with a warning against heresy, instruction on how to act when confronted by it, and reassurance that their betters care and are looking out for them. It also serves a subtle but important political purpose. By masking the Monodominants' extreme hatred of psykers behind layers of legal and moral justification, the Witchfinder blunts the jurisdictional anger of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica when psykers that should have been delivered to their custody are die during tests or by an incensed mob of onlookers. After all, it was neither the Inquisition or the Ecclesiarchy who put them to the torch, but their own peers in a moment of ochlocratic violence. That the Witchfinder was the proximate cause of these events is only a minor detail, of course.

### **Becoming a Witchfinder**
All Witchfinders are of the Ordo Hereticus, specifically its puritan faction, and have been trained by an informal association of Monodominant Inquisitors and more firebrand elements of the Ecclesiarchy to destroy renegade psykers in a uniquely flamboyant way. The Acolyte's previous work in uncovering heretical cults, withstanding truths that would decimate a lesser mind, and the oratory and rhetorical faculties from their time in the Ministorum prepare them for the rigours of facing witches.

A Witchfinder is invested with a certain measure of authority and freedom of action by the Ordo Hereticus, and most are seen as something of a junior Interrogator who has a great deal of potential should they continue to serve faithfully and effectively. A good number of puritan Inquisitors were originally Witchfinders, and some still maintain that title even many years after being awarded their own Rosette.

**Required Career:** Cleric
