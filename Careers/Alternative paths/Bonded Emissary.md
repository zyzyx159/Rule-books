*"My masters regret that your harvest has failed governor and unrest stirs your little world. Perhaps you should seek assistance from the free captains as you did three years ago when you turned down our last generous offer, and with it the protection of our friendship… no? Well, unfortunately things have grown harsher in the sub-sector of late and our price now is regrettably somewhat higher…"*

— Adept-Assayer Alisha Zhou, Emissary of the Machenko Dynasty.

Travel is a hazardous business, and foolish is the man or woman who steps unwary of the dangers away from the safety of their own, let alone seeks to travel the cold and merciless darkness between the stars. Such travel in some ways is an even more dangerous business for the powerful and wealthy of the Calixis Sector's elites, because, although insulated by their power and their followers from commonplace hardships, they often have many enemies and much to lose. The Imperium of man is a grim and deadly place; the great and the powerful must always fear the assassin's hand, as well as the intrigues, plots and machinations of their rivals. It is unsurprising that many choose to remain at the centre of their domains and, when matters of import arise that do not require their personal presence, they send others out in their stead. The Bonded Emissary is just such a person. Emissaries are, by their nature, powerful individuals, no mere messenger, trade factor or errand-runner. An Emissary speaks with their master's voice and carries with them their master's authority (to a point). Such a trusted and delicate position requires much from the individual involved, as they must be above all, clever, socially adept and strong-willed. They must also have a mastery of the facts at hand and be aware of the subtle interplay of politics, while being wary always for the manoeuvring and plotting of their master's rivals. Some Emissaries focus on the skills of the diplomat and the negotiator, while others act mainly as agents to evaluate and acquire objects, opportunities and even people who their masters might wish to recruit. Successful Emissaries soon become recognised and valued, and win favour and power in their own right. Those that fail their employers abjectly or cause them to lose face seldom get a second chance.

In the Calixis Sector, as in much of the Imperium, Emissaries go by numerous names and titles depending on their task and their master. The Administratum has a labyrinthine series of titles and designations, from the Quastor Maximus who sits in attendance at the Lucid Palace, to the grey ranks of reeves, delagators, potentates and the innumerable sub-consuls, consuls lesser and peripatetic that shuttle between its concerns and the other branches of the Adeptus Terra and Commercia. The great trade guilds and trans-stellar cartels, such as the Skaelen-Har Hegemony and the DeVayne Corporation, have their brokers, agents and procurators to represent them. The noble houses of Scintilla, Malfi and the other major worlds have their own heralds and nuncios, and upand-coming scions that provide them with ambassadors and who maintain their presence at court. The various powers and domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus also largely depend on Emissaries chosen from the ranks of their tech-priests to interact with the wider Imperium, whose "petty" concerns and intrigues as they see them hold little interest for the Magos. The tech-priests themselves, are largely the source of some not unjustified fear, misunderstanding, and apprehension by others, and in order to overcome this difficulty and secure their desired outcomes, the ordered minds of the Mechanicus will engage a specialist to act for them.

## **Becoming a Bonded Emissary**

Inquisitors have need of skilled individuals other than trained killers, mind-bending psykers, and dogged investigators. They often need liars and dissemblers, individuals whose perception allows them to read the subtle ebb and flow of the interplay of a noble's court, and men and women who can detect the subtle taint of madness beneath a genial façade. Emissaries are perfect for such tasks, and an Acolyte with these skills can be confidently relied upon to act as the cornerstone of any covert investigation, often with the backing of false identities and cover provided by the Holy Ordos. Those that meet them, while in one of their cover identities, rarely guess their true master unless they decide to reveal it.

**Required Career:** Adept or Tech-Priest. **Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp). **Other requirements:** Intelligence 30 and Fellowship 30.
