## **Agent of Reliquary 26**

*“Ours is not an easy task. We gather those most important relics, those symbols of the culture of Mankind. We dare the darkness and travel across the stars clinging to rumour and legend as our guide.”*

— Marcius Dans, Agent of Reliquary 26
### **Background**
Entombed more than a hundred metres beneath the Inquisition's majestic if imposing Tricorn Palace is the Grand Reliquarium, a series of vaults that are home to many artefacts and powerful relics of the Calixis Sector. In these hallowed halls rest hundreds of items of power, from crafted trinkets of the Dark Age of Technology to the blessed weapons of venerable martyrs or even saints. Each of these vaults, of which reliable sources claim there at at least one hundred, are heavily guarded, monitored, and tended to by the Custodiatrix, a small organisation of curator-assassins, each charged with the safety of the artefacts and assigned to one of the vaults. Reliquary 26 contains the relics of the Scholariate at Arms.

In addition to housing artefacts, Reliquary 26 also employs a great number of Agents, men and women who scour the Calixian worlds in search of more items of renown to add to the vaunted collection. Whether through negotiation, deception, or violence, the goal of these Agents is a simple one: ensure the safety and survival of the relics of Man. To do so, they must first identify such items of power, decide whether or not the current ownership is valid, and reclaim the item in question, by force if necessary. Often, Agents act alone or in pairs, though it is not uncommon for an entire cadre of mercenaries to be hired if an acquisition proves particularly difficult. It is rumoured that that the Scholariate at Arms once hired an entire house of assassins to reclaim a relic from the blessed armour of Saint Drusus, though the veracity of such a rumour could never be proven.

As one might expect, Agents of Reliquary 26 are very well outfitted. Although they are relatively unknown as an organisation, members often find themselves at odds with Calixian nobles, Ecclesastical prelates, Rogue Traders, and mercantile magnates—individuals who often value their possessions and do not wish to part with them simply because the Inquisition asks nicely. As a result, many Agents have at least one or two enemies in the upper echelons of Imperial society. Though the agency does attempt to reimburse the owners of the relics they acquire, it is not uncommon for them to have to pry the artefact in question from the lifeless fingers of some greedy soul that simply couldn't part with it for any amount of compensation.

Reliquary 26 works quite closely with the larger Ordos of the Inquisition. Often, Inquisitors find themselves with items of interest left over from an investigation. In exchange for the safe return of any relics or artefacts found by an Inquisitor in the course of his duties, Reliquary 26 will often return the favour by loaning out an item of great power. Many Inquisitors are quite content to employ Agents of Reliquary 26 in their Acolyte cells, profiting from the Agents' access to rare and often powerful devices while maintaining a mutually-beneficial relationship with the Custodiatrix. 
### **Becoming an Agent of Reliquary 26**
An experienced servant of Reliquary 26 is an indispensable resource to an Acolyte cell. When dealing with nobility or other well-to-do types, or in areas where ancient or xenos technology may
be encountered, an Inquisitor would be well served by requisitioning an Agent of Reliquary 26's services. Such Agents usually only serve the Inquisitor the duration of the investigation at hand. Inquisitors who must regularly navigate such treacherous situations have been known to second a trusted Acolyte to the Custodiatrix to be trained in their ways, effectively gaining a permanent "representative" to Reliquary 26's hallowed armoury. As the point of contact between the Grand Reliquarium and the often covetous owners of the sought-after artefacts, most Agents become quite adept at negotiation and tradecraft. Such skills can be invaluable to an Acolyte cell, especially in situations where a hostile acquisition could be more troublesome than normal.

**Required Career:** Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Must have acquired one item of Near Unique Availability or rarer, and turned it over to his Inquisitor or directly to the Grand Reliquarium.
**Aggrieved Parties:** Even if the character has not personally wronged them, at least one group of well-heeled individuals gravely dislikes Reliquary 26. The character gains the [Rival (Ecclesiarchy), (Nobility), or (Rogue Trader)](talents.md#rival) Talent at the GM's discretion.
**Reliquary Loan:** The Grand Reliquarium has resources that include ancient and exotic equipment that is sometimes entrusted to Acolytes serving an Inquisitor. At the beginning of each mission the character gains one valuable item determined by the GM. Unless the character receives some special dispensation, the item must be returned after the mission, with grave consequences for those who try to deprive the Reliquarium of their property. The GM should choose an item that they feel is appropriate to the Acolyte's mission.

## **Cult of the Pure Form**

*"The flesh is strong!"*

— Pure Form maxim
### **Background**
Given the intense liturgical "differences" between them, the Ecclesiarchy and the Adeptus Mechanicus have never enjoyed a healthy working relationship within the Calixis Sector. Conflicts between the two organisations tend to be wars of words, though, political battles fought in the capital worlds of the Sector, rather than outright "shooting wars" between men and machines. Nevertheless, there have been several overt conflicts, such as the attack on the Explorator vessel *Omega Inquiry* from an Adepta Sororitas strike force on the far edges of the Halo Stars. There are no official records of the encounter, but the Tricorn contains sealed datavaults hinting at a heretofore undiscovered abhuman strain that the Mechanicus had uncovered far from civilised space, and the Ministorum’s reactions of horror when their spies reported the discovery. Greatly displeasured by the loss of the Explorator coterie, a Mechanicus Secutor cohort laid waste to two outpost convents in retaliation, and was about to escalate further before secretive diplomacy and unnamed offerings negotiated by third parties settled the matter. Such incidents are still rare, but with the gradual rise of a group calling itself the Cult of the Pure Form, this could begin to change.

It is not known exactly who founded the Cult of the Pure Form, but their influence began in the Malfian Sub-Sector in the immediate aftermath of the Malygrisian Heresy. The traitorous Tech- Priest and his followers ravaged numerous worlds with their devastating weaponry, and some began to think that the existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus would lead to another, inevitable war. The followers of this emerging cult feared that this coming doom would scour humankind from the galaxy, leaving only the cold, barely-human flesh and machine hybrids of the Mechanicus domains behind. This twisted line of logic grew quickly until the first major anti-Mechanicum movement of the Calixis Sector’s history began to swell, with loud marches and violent demonstrations.

In an unexpected move, and one that likely came about due to Cult Mechanicus political manoeuvring on Scintilla, the Sector Synod declared the emergent cult apostate. Over the next decades the cult leaders began to disappear, some dying in mysterious accidents while others perished in what were clearly outright assassinations. Some thought that the Inquisition was to blame, and others whispered of the Officio Assassinorum’s involvement, but very few were aware that the secretive Lords Dragon of the Mechancius bore sole responsibility for this early intervention, and that their clandestine methods had managed to stifle the movement before it
could truly become established. For its part, the Calixian Inquisition viewed this suppression as a grievous overstep of the Lords Dragon's authority beyond the realm of the Lathes, and it was made abundantly clear to the Magi that another transgression of that scale would engulf them in a true shadow war they were not liable to win.

After more high-level negotiation, the Lords Dragon agreed to cease their campaign of suppression, handing over all information they had gathered on the new sect for the Inquisition to process as it saw fit. While the watchers of the Panopticon hoped that the Inquisition would continue their work in stamping out the Cult of the Pure Form, the Conclave determined it was largely harmless to the broader Imperium, and contented themselves to merely monitoring its activities for emergent signs of heresy.

With the bionic boot of the Lords Dragon permanently removed from its figurative throat, the Cult of the Pure Form rose once again, finding succour and eager supporters anywhere common men took umbrage to the Mechanicus' abuses or superstitious fear of its unknowable rites. This time, however, a new generation of cult leaders threw out its previous methods in favour of a slower approach, and rather than attempting to whip the people of a single sub-sector into a frenzy, they would instead choose to let their hatred for the Mechanicus gradually simmer on worlds across the entire Sector.

A second blow came in the form of Ignato Borja, the new Arch-Cardinal of the Sector Synod. Under Ignato's stewardship the Ecclesiarchy curiously refrained denouncing the reformed Cult of the Pure Form. Indeed, Mechanicus spies close to the Ministorum's prelates reported that, at least unofficially, the Ecclesiarchy was quite content to allow the reach of the Pure Form cultists to grow, seeing any harm it might cause the Mechanicus as a potential gain for themselves. Even the Inquisition would be of no aid—initially suspicious of the Pure Form's return to prominence, many of the more puritanical Inquisitors who looked into the cult's ways began to see them in a positive light, emulating agreeable philosophies about the sanctity of the human body and acting as valuable check against the Mechanicus' own clandestine efforts.

Their mechadendrites tied, the Lords Dragon have been forced to passively observe as the Cult of Pure Form rose to prominence once more. Like clockwork, any egregious display of the Mechanicus' power beyond its forge worlds—an Explorator press-gang crew riving through starport public houses, or servitor-artisans systemically scooping up dregs in a hab-vault—is likely to be followed up by an agitator from the Pure Form arriving to preach about the sin and hubris of the Martian Priesthood.

As a matter of liturgy, the Cult of the Pure Form’s members—most of them, anyway—do not hate the Adeptus Mechanicus purely for their worship of the Omnissiah, and neither are they explicitly anti-technology. They simply wish to wrest control of such power away from the Mechanicus, proffering the provincial view that “uncorrupted” humans might control it instead. Their true ire stems from the extensive use of cybernetics and other mechanical implants that virtually every member of the Adeptus Mechanicus possesses. To the cult, the most pure form in the universe is that of the human body, an image of the God-Emperor Himself, and to defile it by removing untainted flesh and grafting on artificial limbs and organs is blasphemy in its own right.

Quite a few members of the Cult of the Pure Form have cybernetic implants when they join. These souls are often spurred on by dissatisfaction with low quality or cheap implants, or suffer a form of "cyberpsychosis" where they cannot perceive their augments as part of their own body and come to loathe their presence. These cultists undergo a ritual known as the Purity of Flesh to remove the implants from their bodies. 

This ritual often leaves the participant missing limbs or eyes, and can rob them of their ability to hear or even speak. Known as the “Shriven” by other Pure Form cultists, these blessed men and women are highly regarded, having seen the purity of the human body as it was meant to be and unshackling themselves from the augmetic prisons of the Mechanicus. Most will choose to replace their removed cybernetics with strictly fleshy equivalents, often vat-grown examples cultivated for the individual Shriven in question, although some are forced to make do with biomatter reclaimed and purified from servitors or harvested from executed criminals. Especially pious cultists have been known to reject even this, however, getting by with purely inert prostheses and simply accepting the loss of ability that comes from a missing body part as an intractable and, indeed, necessary aspect of the human condition.

The bulk of the cult’s ranks, however, are made up of those fortunate enough to have lived without the defilement of cybernetics, and are referred to as the “Untouched.” Each Untouched member comes to the sect for different reasons, but most are spurred on by a love of the God-Emperor as a human paragon and an inherent mistrust of, or an outright animus towards, the Adeptus Mechanicus.

The Cult of the Pure Form does not sit by and wait passively for people to see its point of view, and indeed instituted their own group of missionaries. This third group is the most powerful within the cult, and are known as the “Reformed.” Acting as the public face of the cult, the Reformed are a large, sector-spanning network. They commonly preach that the God-Emperor had not a single cybernetic in the days when He walked amongst mortals, and that if He was pure of flesh, then so too should His subjects be. The Reformed mainly consist of Shriven who have reversed the process of bionic implantation, creating implants not of unholy cybernetics, but instead made out of pure (if sometimes misshapen) flesh. To the Reformed any inefficiencies or inferior function these parts have compared to the soulless steel they replaced is simply an expression of faith and piousness towards the very idea of the Pure Form itself.
### **Becoming a Cultist of the Pure Form**
There are many ways to be tempted to join the Cult of the Pure Form. For some, it is due to a feeling of betrayal, where replacement cybernetics have caused more harm than good, and the poor soul shackled by them is looking for a form of release among the ranks of the Shriven. Others, after hearing the words of the Reformed, have come to understand that the continued existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus is nothing but a disaster waiting to happen, and that it is their holy duty to stand in judgement of this abominable organisation. Others join out of a fear that if they begin to receive cybernetics that they will lose something of their own souls, and eagerly join the ranks of the Untouched to avoid this horrific fate. A select few might even be contacted directly by the cult’s senior members, as their membership would greatly benefit the cult’s standing and appeal across the Sector. The cult also offers a strong brotherhood and a cause to motivate new meaning into previously meaningless lives. Those who achieve such purity in their flesh may find their spirit even stronger than before, and certainly stronger than those who foolishly trust their bodies to the uncaring and dispassionate machine.

Upon becoming a member of the Cult of the Pure Form, the character gains the **Excommunicate Mechanicum Trait**.

**Required Career:** Any except Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Cleric—Rank 2 or higher (500 xp); All others—Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Any Acolyte who possess any bionics/cybernetics when taking this Alternate Rank must take the Purity of Flesh Talent before he may take any further Advances. Acolytes who do not possess any bionics/cybernetics when selecting this Rank must select the Gift of Purity Talent before they may take any further Advances.
#### **Trait: Excommunicate Mechanicum**
The Cult of the Pure Form is not a secretive group, in which members meet covertly in dank basements or crumbling hab blocks. They have made their presence felt and do not feel the need to hide their beliefs. The Mechanicus, in turn, view them as dangerous, misguided fools, and treat them with open disdain at best optimal servitor components at worst. Should any member of the Machine Cult learn of the Acolyte’s true allegiance, there could be dire consequences. If discovered, treat any member of the Mechanicus as having the lowest possible Disposition towards the character (and vice versa). The GM may even, in extreme situations, determine that acts of outright violence might be called for. Additionally, all forms of Interaction—even just speaking with members of the Machine Cult—are to be treated as **Arduous (–40)** before factoring in other modifiers.

*†This Talent has no xp cost, but can only be selected under specific circumstances. See each Talent's description for details.*
#### **Talent: Gift of Purity**
The Acolyte has forsaken the cybernetic, cast out the desire for the bionic, and joined the ranks of the Untouched. Never will sacred flesh be sullied by the implantation of devices that rob the Acolyte of his purity. The character cannot, under any circumstances, choose or accept the implantation of cybernetics/bionics, even if the result of refusing them would result in certain death. If the character finds himself implanted with cybernetics/bionics against his will, then he must remove them as soon as possible, replacing this Talent with the Purity of Flesh instead. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase, and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have no cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank.
#### **Talent: Purity of Flesh**
The Acolyte has participated in the Purity of Flesh ritual and emerged alive. Taking his place amongst the Shriven, he has become truly blessed, and despite his missing limbs, eyes, and other organs, he feels more complete now than he ever did with his soulless metallic attachments. All cybernetics and bionics that the character had previously must be removed, including internal cybernetic implants. If doing so would normally result in the character’s death, such as in the case of a Bionic Respiratory System, the character must also take the Reformed Skin Talent to provide a life-saving replacement, permanently reducing his Toughness by 1d5 and Wounds by 1.

The effects of removing cybernetic implants is similar to sustaining [Critical Damage](injury%20and%20healing.md#serious%20injuries%20and%20conditions) and the Acolyte should be attended to by a trained medicae to reduce the risk of death from the process. Augmetics that provide additional specific effects, such as a mind impulse unit or bio-power cells, cease to do so once removed from the body. The character gains 1 additional Fate Point (up to a maximum of 5) for every two bionics that he has removed (with the exception of Mechadendrites). The character must remove each and every augmetic from his body before he receives this benefit, so characters with quite a few may need to spend considerable downtime recuperating between surgeries (allowing their Critical Damage to heal) before they increase their Fate Points. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank. The character counts as having the Gift of Purity Talent for the purposes of refusing new cybernetics.
#### **Talent: Reformed Skin**
For those Acolytes who prefer to remain whole physically as well as spiritually they may take on entirely new flesh to replace the hateful cybernetics that have been removed. A Cultist of the Pure Form may select this Talent as many times as he has missing limbs, senses, or organs—any human body part replaced with a cybernetic or lost due to Critical Damage.

When taken, the Acolyte gains a replacement body part reclaimed from a servitor or an executed criminal. The replacement is not a perfect analogue for the Acolyte's original flesh, however, and imposes the same penalties that a Poor Craftsmanship cybernetic would (and, obviously, does not confer a bonus to his Toughness or a reduced chance of death from Critical Effects). Superior examples, vat-grown in bioreactors to closely match the Acolyte's body, may be purchased for 75% the cost of a cybernetic replacement instead—these effectively duplicate the Acolyte's missing parts and impose no penalties on their use (but still doesn't grant any special benefits or effects that an augmetic part might).

Any Fate Points gained from the Purity of Flesh Talent are lost when the missing parts are replaced with Reformed Skin, so the pious cultist should consider carefully how much he's willing to go without when considering a flesh-crafted replacement. Unless the missing body part would lead to inevitable death, such as a bionic cardiac system, the Acolyte is under no obligation to actually take this Talent. Reformed Skin costs no xp to purchase, though there may be a cost in Thrones if the Acolyte wishes to utilise a better quality part. 
## **Cult-Stalker**

*"We are at war with forces too terrible to comprehend. We cannot afford mercy for any of its victims too weak to take the correct course. Mercy destroys us; it weakens us and saps our resolve. Put aside all such thoughts. They are not worthy of Inquisitors in the service of our Emperor. Praise His name for in our resolve we only reflect His purpose of will."*

— excerpt from Verses of Inquisitor Octus Enoch
### **Background**
An uncomfortable revelation many Acolytes of the Inquisition come to realise through the course of their duties is that there are cults devoted to the Dark Gods hidden within all levels of society. Such is the hideously virulent nature of Chaos that the most insignificant underhive dreg all the way up to their planetary governor are vulnerable to its taint, and even knowledgeable members of the Adepta are far from immune to such profane temptations. Each Chaos cult plans its own way to escape detection until it can grow to the point of dominating society and begin paying the horrific toll of souls demanded by its dark masters.

Extremist political organisations and criminal syndicates make especially good fronts for cults, since they naturally attract the power-hungry, the faithless, and the mentally unbalanced, each of whom can be quite well-suited to becoming wholly believing members of a cult. A very successful cult can even gain enough power to become the governing body of its home planet, surreptitiously toppling Imperial rule without ever having to resort to rebellion. In some respects, secret societies and recidivist gangs are one of the greatest threats facing the Holy Inquisition—they are innumerable in their multitudes and diversity, yet any could be a fertile breeding ground for cultist activity.

Often, cults lair in unsavory parts of cities where no lawgiver would dare go without formidable backup. As they do not want to call attention to this problem, a “troubleshooter” is occasionally brought in from the local criminal element to assist the planetary enforcers, or even the Adeptus Arbites, by infiltrating the cult and determining the degree of depravity that is occurring within. 
Usually this service comes at the price of a pardon for the troubleshooter's other crimes, but some street scum have been willing to offer their assistance with an investigation purely out of their personal devotion to the God-Emperor. Firebrand Ministorum priests are apt to preach that faithlessness and recidivism go hand in hand, but any hardened enforcer worth his salt knows the faithful don't always obey the law.

The Inquisition, always looking to keep a step ahead from those who would tear the Imperium asunder with their vile machinations, has not been ignorant of the cult infiltration methods of the various lawgivers of Calixis. For those who've witnessed the horrors a clandestine Chaos cult is capable of unleashing if allowed to take root, finding out whether a given secret society is trucking with the Ruinous Powers or merely up to mundane acts of deviancy is of paramount importance. The Cult-Stalker, a creation of some less puritanical Inquisitors of the Calixian Conclave, is a purpose-made tool for this task.

A Cult-Stalker's mission is deceptively simple: infiltrate a cult, gather information about its ways and means, and determine if the cult represents a moral threat of heresy. The Stalker may have to participate in dark initiation rituals or perform all matters of heathen acts in order to gain access to the cult's upper echelons, and those unable to keep their true loyalties in order are likely to be short-lived agents. Once the nature of the threat, if any, is identified, the Cult-Stalker must then collect as much evidence as possible before exfiltrating the organisation to present their findings. This is often easier said than done, especially for Stalkers who have gained the trust of the cult's inner circles.

Some Inquisitorial Acolytes, already skilled in the arts of deception and deep cover, choose to take up this difficult and often thankless task, seeing it as a challenge to their abilities or perhaps just the best way they can serve their master. Most, however, are true scummers who've been dragooned into a radical Inquisitor's employ—guilty of some misdeeds that warranted an Inquisitor's attention, the unfortunate lowlifes are coerced into becoming Cult-Stalkers to avoid punishment, a sort of penitent informant. Such Acolytes are considered entirely disposable at first, but those who've successfully managed to infiltrate a cult to the satisfaction of their new master can find their stock rising quite quickly.
### **Becoming a Cult-Stalker**
A successful Cult-Stalker must have a keen eye for detail and a strong yet inquiring mind, capable of playing the role of a cultist without becoming fully engulfed in the cult's ways. The Cult-Stalker is no mere undercover agent, but fully commits to the part, outwardly appearing to be exactly the sort of heretic or degenerate that their master ultimately aims to destroy. Cult-Stalkers undergo a thorough programme of instruction on the nature of the cult they are to infiltrate, but once inside are entirely left to their own discretion about how to rob the cult of its secrets and escape alive.

**Required Career:** Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp)
**A Dreg is Still a Dreg:** Ultimately, the dangerous game a Cult-Stalker plays is just a far more perilous version of what many deceitful scummers get up to on the regular. The often surprisingly well-heeled nature of many cults does tend to give more opportunities for profit along the way, however. The character still generates monthly income as an Outcast, but substitutes the following table in place of **Scum Income**:

#### **Talent: Cult Briefing**
The Cult-Stalker has undergone a significant regimen of preparatory indoctrination ahead of their planned infiltration. Depending on the type of the cult he has been tasked with infiltrating he gains one of the following benefits:

* **Political:** The character has spent weeks memorising the intricate relationships of noble families, powerful local leaders, cabinet advisers and military personnel. The character may treat all [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore) Skills as Basic Skills. In addition, he is treated as having the [Total Recall](talents.md#total%20recall) Talent when attempting to recall someone's name within one world’s political or social elite.
* **Heretek:** The character has spent hours alongside Tech-Priests, learning their ways and examining their mannerisms. He has been implanted with a single augmetic designed to appear "questionable" to Mechanicus observers. He gains the [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Skill and one of the following Talents: [Autosanguine](talents.md#autosanguine), [Logis Implant](talents.md#logis%20implant), [Orthoproxy](talents.md#orthoproxy) or [Technical Knock](talents.md#technical%20knock).
* **Pleasure:** Steady doses of poison within controlled environments, chemical treatments, and dozens of surgeries have prepared the character to resist the call of a pleasure cult while simultaneously making them look like a perfect candidate. The character gains +5 Fellowship and chooses either the [Chem Geld](talents.md#chem%20geld) or [Decadence](talents.md#decadence) Talent.
* **Blood:** Endless hours of martial training and physical conditioning have prepared the Acolyte to impress cult members with his martial prowess. The character gains the [Melee Weapon Training (*Any—choose one*)](talents.md#melee%20weapon%20training) and [Frenzy](talents.md#frenzy) Talents.
* **Culture:** Hypno-indoctrination and months of linguistic drills have prepared the character to blend seamlessly in with a society alien to his own and work his way into the halls of power. The character chooses one Homeworld other than his own and gains all the Traits associated with that Homeworld (both negative and positive).

This selection is permanent, and the Cult-Stalker is best employed when utilised against similar cults to the one he was indoctrinated to infiltrate.
## **Demagogue**

*“You have been forsaken! You have been enslaved by lies, beaten by injustice, and bled by greed, but you have not bowed your heads or bent your knees. If it takes a thousand years and a river of blood, then so be it, but we will be free!”*

— unidentified heretic on Tranch prior to the rising of the Pale Throng 
### **Background**
Demagogues are rabble rousers and agitators who can sway great crowds with their words. These fiery orators may be cult leaders, idealists, madmen, fanatics, or subtle manipulators and agent provocateurs. All, however, have the skill to draw crowds together with words, bind them with rhetoric, and loose them on a target like a pack of dogs. Worlds have burned because of the actions of such men and women. Some wish for nothing more than to see the world around them torn down and set aflame, to stoke the fires of anger and dissent to the point of an all-consuming inferno. Others are created by the injustices done to them or those around them, injustices that push the demagogue past the confines of society and into open insurrection against those in authority or anyone else the demagogue believes to have wronged them. Many Demagogues within the Imperium are touched with such conviction and faith that they use their skills to build crusades of the credulous and desperate.

Many, if not most, demagogues true believers, faithful and loyal to the Emperor in mind and action, but the consequences of their fomentations can be extremely dire for those in positions of power. Indeed, planet-wide sectarian conflicts, religious schism, and popular upheaval strong enough to threaten the Imperial tithe have all been started, likely quite unwittingly, by demagogues faithful to the Master of Mankind yet scorning of His temporal vassals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, to many Imperial authorities, these incendiary individuals are, for the most part, a menace whose activities must be controlled, and if necessary, curtailed—possibly with great and uncompromising force.

This is often more easily said than done. Rare is the Emperor-fearing demagogue who will willingly end their campaign of incitement under threats from authorities they already care little for in the first place. In some cases, productive negotiation has led to a cooling of tensions and a certain measure of redress for the demagogue's grievances, but this is more often the exception than the rule. Mutual animosity and irreconcilable differences have frequently led to short-sighted potentates having the demagogue silenced permanently, only to watch in horror as the demagogue's followers explode into completely uncontrollable revolt, anarchy, and destruction over their martyred leader's demise.

Persecuting recidivist demagogues, those who hold no great love for the Imperium or its institutions, can be even more of a thorny prospect. Many demagogues are adept at slipping through the Imperial society unseen and unaccounted for. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a recidivist demagogue to appear long enough to create a brushfire rebellion or riot, only to melt away when the authorities move against them and begin plans anew to replicate the destruction they have unleashed somewhere else. It matters not whether the demagogue is motivated by a personal conviction to see the forces and structure of ordered society burn, or if the act of inciting revolt is simply a profitable enterprise to be repeated for the demagogue's simple cupidity. These elusive agitators are the most dangerous and hunted variety of demagogue, and many are counted amongst the Calixis Sector's most notorious of rebels and heretics. 

Among Inquisitors of a less-puritanical mien a demagogue could be a very valuable asset. Some Inquisitors will train a demagogue in the art of incitement, effectively creating a rabble-rousing agent they can deploy where social unrest and disarray are needed. Others could be true recidivist demagogues co-opted by the Inquisition as a means of avoiding a far worse fate than instigating a crisis over a cause they don't believe in. Such "social" weapons are often deployed into situations where an Inquisitor has reason to believe the authority in question has fallen to corruption or heresy, but either lacks the means to prove it to the more staid Adeptus, or the unique circumstances of the situation preclude simply arresting or removing said authority by the Inquisitor's own prerogative.

It has been said by some (albeit in decidedly hushed tones) within the halls of Lord Hax's Lucid Palace that the mutant uprising on Tranch was the product of just such an Inquisitorial gambit. Sensing that the slowly growing unrest within Tranch's soot warrens would inevitably lead to an uprising against that world's feckless oligarchs, a handful of radical Recongregationist Inquisitors hatched a bold scheme. The Recongregationists, already entirely dismissive of the planetary authorities, believed that the mutant Shroud Masters of Tranch would use the uprising to launch a massive uprising of other mutants and abhumans across the entire Sector. 

Instead of trying to prevent the uprising in the first place—deemed to be a hopeless prospect in light of Tranch's brutal and deeply ingrained discord—the Recongregationists took several steps to deliberately accelerate the upheaval. This included sending in a cadre of trained demagogues explicitly to agitate the discontent of the soot warren dwellers. The scheme worked, and the world was in full revolt in a matter of months. The Shroud Masters, caught by surprise as the uprising they were carefully preparing suddenly and fiercely launched right out from under them, were not yet in a position to propagate the revolution to the other hive worlds of Calixis. Their master plan thwarted, the Shroud Masters scattered as the Imperial Guard retook the rebelling world spire by spire and hive by hive. Of no minor footnote, the larger body of the Inquisition ousted Tranch's surviving oligarchs, deeming them collectively guilty of such dereliction and incompetence as to have all but caused the revolt in the first place.

If this pernicious rumour is to be believed, the Recongregationists were broadly successful. The Shroud Masters' Sector-wide uprising was suppressed before it could begin, Tranch's inefficacious oligarchs were either killed or replaced, and Calixis had millions fewer mutants by the time the Imperial Guard regiments were being demobilised. Officially, the Inquisition has rigorously denied that any such scheme existed. This is just as well, as if there was any truth to it, the supposed Recongregationists would do well to keep their actions secret even from their peers. Even disregarding the millions of dead civilians and Guardsmen, the near-total destruction of Tranch's economy and much of its infrastructure brought about by a planetary revolt literally instigated by the radicals could have them accused of sedition, if not outright heresy.
### **Becoming a Demagogue**
Demagogues who serve radical Inquisitors usually assume the role through necessity. When you are charged with bringing blood and destruction or instigating fundamental changes in the structure of Imperial authority, the ability to create a riot, instigate a mutiny, and foment rebellion is useful indeed. Talented orators and socially adept Acolytes may embrace this role and dedicate themselves to perfecting its finer points, while some are thrust towards it by their master. While it is their best-known talent, demagogues are not limited to practising their social graces before large crowds, and any Acolyte cell could benefit from having a master of rhetoric and persuasion to aid them when the bullets and las blasts aren't flying. 

**Required Career:** Adept, Cleric, Imperial Psyker, or Scum

Since the dark days of Sebastian Thor’s great reformation, the Ministorum has been prevented, by the dictates of the Decree Passive, from maintaining forces that consist of “men at arms.” Although this statute put an end to the vast standing armies of the ancient Ecclesiarchy, the archaic wording of the decree has been subjected to many abuses and creative interpretations over the centuries, and only a fool would assume that the Ecclesiarchy lacks military power.

In times of great need—wars of faith and crusades, but also revolts and disasters—Ecclesiastical authorities will arm its male servants, both from the clergy and the mass of lay followers. A great mass of clerks, Deacons, Pardoners, and other minor functionaries swarm from the great temples and cathedrals, armed with whatever weapons they can lay their hands upon. To some, they are nothing but a disorganised rabble, a greater threat to themselves than to any opposing force, but on many occasions a hastily-assembled Frateris Militia have been known to perform tremendous acts of courage and valour in the name of the Emperor. Though rarely mentioned by the remembrancers once the conflict has passed, more than a few worlds have been saved from xenos invasion and the forces of rebellion by the fervent defence of a legion of Ecclesiastical militiamen.

Members of the Frateris Militia are not professional soldiers, and receive no formal training in their role, although frontier diocese and those on politically unstable worlds have been known to drill their able-bodied clergy on basic military tactics (on a strictly unofficial basis, of course). However, their faith is strong, and what they lack in standardised equipment and manuals of arms they make up for with zeal to serve the God-Emperor.

One of the many legends of St. Drusus involves a close friend and confidant, Abbot Rempsi. As a young man Rempsi had been drafted into the Frateris Militia and joined the crusade to return the Calyx Expanse into the Imperial fold. He was a fiery orator whose rage was barely contained even when not surrounded by the bloodshed of combat. The survival rate of most Frateris Militia during the Angevin Crusade was poor by any standards, but Rempsi managed to survive a dozen conflicts before he met Drusus, providing spiritual counsel to the lay members and urging them on to great feats of bravery once the battle was enjoined.

According to the legend, while in transit to the next war zone a great warship carrying both Imperial Guard and Frateris Militia was assailed by blind, void-dwelling xenos which swarmed through the vessel's halls and atriums hungry for a meal of human flesh. Locked in a bulkhead with several dozen Frateris Militia, Drusus battled alongside Rempsi, holding the choke point leading to the enginarium. Eventually overrun, dozens of xenos rushed through the corridors and would soon overwhelm the enginarium and snuff out the ship's plasma cores. The young Rempsi bellowed with rage and disgust at the abominable force before him, and his militia followed him headlong towards the enemy, only to abruptly stop a few dozen metres short. Peaceful calm washed over them as they began to loudly recite the Litany of Refusal. Overwhelmed by the sonorous chanting, the xenos were repelled, unable to come within striking distance of the Frateris Militia and saving the ship. Drusus knew that he had witnessed a miracle. Abbot Rempsi was forever changed, his spittle-hurling rage replaced by steadfastness and serene determination in the will of the God-Emperor. Rempsi spent much of the rest of the crusade as one of Drusus' most phlegmatic and composed advisers, and is still revered today by the stoic and composed throughout the Sector.
### **Becoming a Frateris Militia**
Those who serve the Ecclesiarchy are often drafted into the Frateris Militia to serve in times of need. While not formally trained or given a wage as members of a proper military would be, they are excused from other official duties during their service. Anyone with strong loyalty to the Ecclesiarchy and a willingness to take up arms against mankind's enemies could have served in a Frateris Militia, and any Inquisitor worth his salt would value a man of faith who also happens to be proficient in combat as a member of an Acolyte cell.

**Required Career:** Adept, Cleric, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp).
**Militia Service:** A character who replaces Rank 1 with Frateris Militia also replaces all starting equipment with a Las Carbine or Hunting Rifle and 2 reloads, Aquila Necklace, a Charm, a Knife, a backpack and a Flak Vest.
**Brothers in Arms:** As the name implies, only male characters may become members of a Frateris Militia. With the (very) notable exception of the Adepta Soroitas, the Ecclesiarchy disdains the idea of expending women in combat.

## **Malfian Bloodsworn**

*"Now be a nice gent and come here and bleed on this warrant for me, eh? Then I'll make it quick for ye, otherwise I'll get a bit put out, and well… I hate swabbing the floor and getting nice parchment dirty. Seems so… undignified like."*

— Auric Kenge, Chartered Bloodsworn
### **Background**
The Blood Guild of Malfi is one of the most infamous organisations of bounty hunters and man-trackers in the whole sector. It owes its origins to a long forgotten internecine war in Malfi's history of vendetta and civil infighting—a history that far predates Malfi's "liberation" during the Angevin Crusade. The Blood Guild has long served to track down, apprehend, or slaughter fugitives whose warrants have been issued by the Malfian Senate. The members of the guild, known as the Bloodsworn, are consummate professionals at their trade. Drafted from the ranks of hardened ex-Imperial Guard, disgraced Arbites, outcast armsmen from the noble houses, and all manner of killers and gunfighters come up from the underhive the hard way, Bloodsworn have a reputation as the best men at their craft that money can buy. This broad organisation operates only one rule—a warrant must be carried out scrupulously and reliably. The individual Bloodsworn owe little loyalty to each other, and indeed several guild members might seek to execute the same lucrative warrant, fully expecting that they'll need to deal with their fellow man-trackers—likely violently—should they cross paths. Such often lethal "competition" is all but encouraged in the guild as a means of weeding out those not up to the standards of the guild's reputation, and the scoundrels and cads often far outlast their more honourable fellows.

Most blood warrants are aptly named, issued in the form of a tough parchment scroll bearing the seal of the authorising body and carrying within it a gene-lock circuit amulet designed to identify the victim by their blood when spilled over it. Some warrants may add further gruesome specifics to the discharge notice, like the retrieval of a body part, or a particular method of death blow to be administered to the target. The returning of the bloodstained warrant results in payment drawn on Malfi's own Obsidian Chancellery. Uncommonly, the target of the blood warrant may be desired to be returned alive, either for trial, questioning, or an altogether more horrendous fate than a mercenary's blade through the neck. Even though the return of the living target obviously satisfies the contract, the blooded warrant must still be surrendered as an ancient custom (and necessarily requiring at least a minor amount of violence be done to the target). Regardless of the particulars of the contract, falsifying a blood warrant in any way is a dire matter indeed, and if such duplicity is detected a blood-price of impressive size is immediately placed on the head of the malefactor by the guild. The blood warrant is a sacred instrument, and woe to any fool who would defile its probity.

As a part of Malfi's often impenetrable legal code and endemic culture of vendetta, a holder of a Bloodsworn Charter has certain rights above that of a mere common hired gun. The warrant enables them to bear arms in the hive where others would not, access to legal record, enter private dwellings, and even avoid interference (largely) from local enforcers and armsmen in pursuit of their warrants. These powers have their limits, however, and any Bloodsworn had better be wary of just who's property they trample on or in whose territory they operate lest they risk an abrupt and possibly quite bloody end. Critically, their customary rights do not extend to the holdings or persons of the Adepta or Malfi's rulers, although few Bloodsworn would be so foolish as to expect their warrant would allow them to barge into an Ecclesiastical convent or 

Originally confined to the sprawling hive cities of Malfi, the Bloodsworn have spread throughout the Calixis since the Angevin Crusade, and a blood warrant will likely be recognised almost immediately across the Malfian sub-sector. For the right price, there is nowhere the Bloodsworn won't track down their prey, and tales of wanted men being tracked down even into the Koronus Expanse are far from the stuff of legends and holo-dramas. The Bloodsworn are afforded a fearful respect throughout almost every developed world of the Calixis Sector, and aside from their quasi-legal role as bounty hunters, many also turn their hands to assassination, personal protection, and mercenary work if the chance arises. To those in the know, merely flashing a copy of the Bloodsworn's charter is an instant qualification of the bearer's capabilities, and can thus demand a high price for their services.

More morally flexible Inquisitors are not above hiring members of the Bloodsworn into their own service for obvious reasons. The Bloodsworn's skill at stealth and tracking, to say nothing of the cover his charter provides, would be a powerful weapon in tracking down heretics and clandestine cultists so that they may face the Emperor's judgement. Some radical Inquisitors have even backed their Acolytes to become Bloodsworn purely for the boons such associations give to their covert operations, although such an aspirant would do well to conceal the nature of their benefactor.
### **Becoming a Malfian Bloodsworn**
Becoming part of the Blood Guild is deceptively simple: the candidates must make their way to one of the guild's charter houses on any of the main worlds of the Malfian sub-sector, offer payment of a thousand Throne gelt, and, as long as they themselves are not under a blood warrant and are not otherwise subject to "higher oath", they are given a "grey warrant" to execute. Grey warrants are those that have languished uncollected on the charter house's books for some time, usually because the money offered doesn't merit the danger or expenditure of time involved in the collection. To become Bloodsworn, all they need do is successfully claim the warrant by any means necessary. This could include the help of others, and assuming they're willing to participate in such an endeavour, might form a small adventure for the other Acolytes to aid in. Once successful, the candidate must then swear a blood oath to abide by the guild's covenants, adding a sample of their blood to the guild's gene registry of members. The candidate is given a guild symbol and a copy of his charter as credentials, and may thereafter claim the right to the title of "Bloodsworn" and execute lawful warrants anywhere the guild's authority is recognised. 

**Required Career:** Assassin, Arbitrator, Guardsman, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp).
**Other Requirements:** Must gain a charter from the Blood Guild of Malfi. Arbitrators and Guardsmen must not be in active Imperial service when receiving their charter, and Acolytes of the Inquisition would need to conceal their true allegiance from the guild.

## **Malifixer**

*"My name is Artonias Scopralo, I solve problems. Am I to understand that cadaver is the one in question? Excellent. I'll need a vat of bio-waste, some corpse starch, and ten kilos of rockcrete mix. If self preservation is an instinct you possess then fetch them quickly. And stop bleeding everywhere, it's breaking my concentration."*

— Artonias Scopralo, Kasballica Malifixer
### **Background**
The criminal underworld in the Calixis Sector is by no means forgiving. It is a harsh, cruel existence punctuated by violence bet against the fleeting hope of a quick payoff. Organisations such as the Kasballica and the Beast House make their way on the backs of the unfortunate individuals that they have collected into their ranks as much by desperation as by ambition or even simple greed. Of course, this is not to say that those lowly scum who make up the bulk of such criminal enterprises are not themselves enterprising and opportunistic individuals who could have been great boons to their fellow man if they'd remained on the straight and narrow. Indeed, while many lackeys of the Calixian underworld are morally bankrupt stubjacks, they are matched by those ambitious souls who would seek only to better their lot, either through criminal advancement and the profits thereof, or by escaping the harsh life to which they were born or have fallen into.

The most cruel and ruthless often rise through the ranks of their organisation through sheer self-serving strength and a willingness to brutalise anyone who would hinder their goals. Others play a more subtle but no less dangerous game, relying on their cunning and quick wits to be in the right place at the right time to make their play for power. All understand to rise above a certain level in their syndicate makes exposure by the authorities an impossible prospect, for if the lawgivers don't kill them first, their former comrades will in the interest of tying up loose ends. Within this world there exists a very particular sort of specialist, most commonly known as a Malifixer, whose trade is to prevent such a grim fate from befalling his paying clients.

Malifixers are men and women whose skills are broad, and their understanding of Imperial Law vast. They watch the Arbitrators and the enforcers as closely as their organisations are watched; often living for years near the Calixian Precinct Fortresses, just observing their ways and building rapport with officers they believe to be corruptible. Some of the most talented Malifixers will even engineer attacks or plant misleading evidence, leading investigators to rival criminal groups—a common expression amongst Scintillan Malifixers is that the best way to defeat your enemies is to have the authorities do it for you.

The Kasballica makes extensive use of Malifixers, using them not only to spy on the organisations of their enemies, but also on their own organisation as well, acting as a sort of criminal enforcer. It is not unheard of for a Malifixer to live for years within a rival group only to turn on them at a vital moment, or deliver key evidence into the hands of the authorities just when they need a break the most. Once positioned securely within an organisation, the Malifixer must simply watch and learn, reporting and interpreting what he sees to his superiors. Given the horrendous consequences should a Malifixer's real loyalty ever be discovered by his comrades in crime, only the most resourceful can ever truly thrive. Those who do become masters of the art of deception and observation, able to willingly perform any clandestine deed their criminal employers demand, all while keeping watch on those around them for a key piece of information.

The key tool in the Malifixer's arsenal is his network of contacts, individuals trusted to perform a task or provide some vital piece of information when no one else can. A successful Malifixer's reach is broad, able to call upon other elements of the criminal underworld, corrupt enforcers, guild bondsmen, and for the most accomplished, even members of the Adepta. If a Malifixer isn't able to make his client's problem go away, he almost certainly knows someone who can. It is said that the best Malifixers no longer need to dirty their hands at all—their investments in developing an expansive spider's web of associations across many levels of Imperial society pays dividends, and the Malifixer need only make a vox call, leave a message in a dead drop, or visit a social club. A favour is called, a service is performed, and the client's troubles are dealt with.

A successful Malifixer would like very, very much to never so much as breathe the same air as a member of the Inquisition. This fell agency's ability to infiltrate organisations and bend individuals to its will humbles even the greatest Malifixer's accomplishments, and if a matter rises to importance enough to draw an Inquisitor's interest, any Malifixer who knows what's right for him would wisely drop the matter. No criminal enterprise, however profitable, is worth the risk of attracting the attentions of the All-Seeing Eye. When they do cross paths, it is often because the Malifixer was in the service of a heretical cult, wittingly or otherwise, and he now finds himself caught up in the Inquisition's inescapable grip. Ordinarily this is the end, and the Malifixer will face the same fate as those he was working for. Less puritanical Inquisitors, however, have been known to see a compromised Malifixer as a potentially extremely capable operative, and it isn't like they're in any position to refuse such a job offer anyway...
### **Becoming a Malifixer**
Once in a great while, a cunning Inquisitorial Acolyte will, with their master's support, re-invent themselves as a Malifixer, carrying on the work much like the genuine issue, but all the while secretly passing information on to their Inquisitor. More often than not, however, a Malifixer falls into the service of an Inquisitor less than voluntarily. Puritan Inquisitors often regard such individuals as just another morally-compromised recidivist, and when swept up during a purge of a heretical cult or organisation they're disposed of along with the common thugs. A radical, however, might see the virtue in offering a Malifixer a second chance if they're willing to serve a new master. Impressed into the service of the Inquisition, the Malifixer now acts as a high-level informant, practising their trade as before but now dutifully reporting when their clients have strayed from mere criminality to outright heresy. 

Most consider this a lifetime punishment, robbed of their freedom of agency, but at least preferable to death. Rarely, a Malifixer with enough self-awareness and gravitas will come to understand this service is a gift, redeeming their corrupt souls in the eyes of the God-Emperor through service to His own Inquisition. A few have even risen quite far within the Holy Ordos. It is rumoured that a handful of full-blooded Inquisitors in the Calixian Conclave, all quite invested in detecting heretical activity in the criminal underworld, are actually born-again Malifixers.

A Malifixer Acolyte is a powerful, if slow-acting, weapon to break open opaque underworld organisations. When the trail of heretical misdeeds leads to a powerful narco-gang or corrupt bondsman's union, a Malifixer who plays his cards right can plant the seeds of doubt in the organisation, offer his services to protect them from detection, and then once in their employ deliver whatever evidences of heresy his master requires to act against them.

## **Metallican Gunslinger**

*"They say he's fast, like chain lightning fast. Don't believe it, no one's that fast."*

— last words attributed to Kail Strom, bounty hunter
### **Background**
The pistoleros of Gunmetal City on Scintilla are the finest in the sector, the most infamous and the most lethal. In action, they are a blazing whirl of muzzle flashes, their hands so fast that their pistols seem mere extensions of their murderous will, and all around them people die. This is the craft of the Metallican Gunslinger, and be they gang heavies, famed arena champions, assassins wreathed in gunsmoke, or grim wanderers, each is worth the price if killing is involved. With its vast manufactoria cranking out untold small arms day and night, Gunmetal City adores the gun and honours above all others those who forge or wield them with great skill. With every man and woman (and most children!) packing at least one piece of cold iron, when a Metallican is said to be a skilled gunman, it is a stone cold truth, as they have managed to elevate themselves above a thousand others to be so named.

Among the ferocious gangs of the lower Infernis regions of the volcano-straddling hive, one's choice of weapon, and skill with it, is a matter of honour, pride, and renown. Counted among their ranks are a truly bewildering array of gunmen. Some consider a single shot kill the most sublime, honing their skills to become snipers the equal of any Imperial Guard veteran, while others prefer to be bedecked in weapons, spraying lead with wild abandon and ready to discard a depleted gun like one drops an empty clip the moment they hear that dreadful click of a firing pin hitting air. Hulking mutants and deranged gangers bearing great slabs of synth-muscle rattle off indiscriminate death with the heaviest artillery Gunmetal's fanes produce, and the so-called "scatterheads"—the shotgun aficionados—push the capabilities of such humble and tested weapons to their absolute limits with all matters of strange and unsanctioned ammunitions. But above all in underworld status, and popular myth, are the Gunslingers, the duellists, the pistoleros—they are the true embodiment of Gunmetal in all its deadly cordite-scented glory.

The finest Gunslingers are undoubtedly from the gangs of the Infernis, the partially-abandoned sprawls of the underhive where whole blocks slowly slide into the magma as the weight of newer construction on the caldera's rim pushes down on them. Deeper still are the shantytowns not known to any maps, which pop up in the volcanic caverns whose molten rock has been siphoned off by the insatiable thermal heat sinks of Gunmetal's forges. In the scalding hot depths, duels between gangs' finest pistol wielders are used to settle matters of reproach or insult between rivals, and anyone who even thinks about bearing a pistol around an Infernis gang had better know how to use it or keep it hidden. It is in this deadly crucible that the Gunslinger is made, the masters of the fast draw and the trick shot. While most Gunslingers live and die with the gangs they grew up with, not an inconsiderable number find more legal employment as "Regulators", hired muscle for the fanes and forges that are the true power in Gunmetal City. Moving up hive, some may take employ as high-priced bodyguards and shadesmen, while others find fame and fortune in the mid-hive arenas, depending on their skills to keep them alive before the baying crowd. The hivers and underhivers of Gunmetal City are not alone in their reverence of the Gunslinger's art. Noble-born duellists, so called "gunrakes", prowl the upper hive reaches in search of slights against their honour so they may exercise their skill on a living target, and great rows between the noble houses of Gunmetal and Sibellus have erupted when a gunrake's lighting quick pistol felled a Sibellan lord expecting their more ritualistic and decorous notion of a duel. The boldest gunrakes venture into the Infernis to test the true extent of their skill, and a few even survive to tell the tale. "Baron Pepperbox", a popular holo-drama on many worlds of the Golgenna and Josian Reaches, is a semi-fictional (and significantly "sanitised") account of one such gunrake who traded his laurels for adventure in the Infernis, eventually becoming the leader of one of its most powerful gangs.

Though they all are dedicated to the deadly way of the pistol, Gunslingers are as different as the weapons they wield. Some crave the renown and respect granted to the most infamous of their kind. The precision-crafted pistols gifted by (or stolen from) a famous fane, the tremor and awe their name inspires, and the hush that descends on a room when they walk in are the finest things life can offer to them. Others are products of a freakish fusing of madness, flamboyance, and skill, deadly strutting peacocks festooned with holstered weapons, as quick to flash a smile and make a mocking quip as they are to slaughter a room full of people. If, however, you ask an Infernis ganger what is the most dangerous breed of Gunslinger, they are sure to tell you it is those who have seen too much, lived too long, and killed too many. These haunted, empty men and women with dead eyes, say little, seem to drift from place to place aimless and alone, and can kill you before you even see them move. This cold breed of wanderers are the fear of even the deadliest ganger, and the most prised, if quixotic, of hired guns. They are the pale death, patient and inevitable, waiting for all who follow the way of the gun.

Metallican Gunslingers and Inquisitors do not often cross paths, although the reputation of their pistoleros is not unknown to those within the Holy Ordos. The prospect of having such a competent death-dealer in their retinue can be an appealing one, but most even-keeled Inquisitors would dismiss this notion as more trouble than it's worth. Prideful, self-centred, not particularly respecting of authority, and too valorous and stouthearted to be coerced into compliance, they simply do not make for good Acolytes for most bearers of the Rosette. For those rare Inquisitors who can tolerate them, however—often a bit of a rebel themselves—a Metallican Gunslinger is an ideal cohort for a retinue of no-doubt other highly capable misfits.
### **Becoming a Metallican Gunslinger**
Most Gunslingers are born, not made, and fall into this path naturally by growing up in the rougher parts of Gunmetal City. Rarely, a few armsmen from other parts hear of the Metallican's reputation and seek them out, aspiring to learn the ways of the Knave of Pistols, but this is by far the exception rather than the rule. The handful that survive long enough to become truly competent pistoleros can count themselves as a real Metallican Gunslinger, but their status as outsiders will always have them viewed with a measure of suspicion.

No Inquisitor worth his Rosette would try to send one of his Acolytes to Gunmetal City with orders to learn the ways of the Metallican Gunslinger—such a mission would be all but impossible for anyone who didn't deeply desire such a feat in their heart, and even then the prospect is questionable at best. A Metallican Gunslinger is far more likely to become an Acolyte after the fact, sought out by a certain kind of Inquisitor for his especially talented way with pistols. Having a Gunslinger for an Acolyte is a powerful weapon, and their familiarity with the goings-on of the underworld can be a useful asset as the cultist and the heretic can often be found in such environs. Of course, the Gunslinger's predilections towards fame and glory-seeking could be quite deleterious to an Acolyte cell trying to keep a low profile during an investigation.

Upon becoming a Metallican Gunslinger, the character gains the **Knave of Pistols Trait**.

**Required Career:** Assassin or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Ballistic Skill 30. This Alternate Career Rank should be selected during character creation, as the process of becoming a Metallican Gunslinger could conceivably take several years.
#### **Trait: Knave of Pistols**
Metallican Gunslingers are notoriously proud of their skill with pistols and disdain the use of all other ranged weapons. Characters with this Trait may not acquire new Basic or Heavy Weapon Training Talents, and may only take Exotic Weapon Training Talents for pistol-class weapons. A character with this Trait may still use other ranged weapons if necessary, but will have great distaste in doing so, improperly handling the gun and eager to be rid of it at first opportunity. Their general scorn for such "long arms" causes these weapons to be treated as if they were of Poor craftsmanship, suffering a –10 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests and gaining the Unreliable quality. If the weapon was already Unreliable, it instead Jams on any failed roll to hit.

#### **Talent: Leatherslap**
**Prerequisites:** Ballistic Skill 50, Quick Draw

For many Metallican Gunslingers the apex of the pistol fighter's art is in the fast draw, the sound of a hand slapping against a leather holster only to be almost instantly drowned out by gunshots and the distinctive thud of dead men hitting the floor. Whenever a Metallican Gunslinger uses the [Quick Draw](talents.md#quick%20draw) Talent to draw a pistol for the first time it gains +1 to Damage inflicted for every degree of success on the Gunslinger's Ballistic Skill Tests until the start of his next Turn. This Talent may only be used the first time the Gunslinger draws a given pistol in each combat, but can be used with as many individual pistols as the Gunslinger carries on his body.
## **Mortiurge**

*“….The Guild-Dame was shot twice at close range while seated at her desk, once to the heart and once to the head. Either wound would have been immediately fatal. The killer had gained access though the front door, posing as a Provost-Captain, and left the premises by walking calmly out the way he entered. Evidence recovered at the scene implicates the Guild-Dame and several other prominent Guilders of bribery of cinq-port officials and cadre enforcers. Arbites Castigation Detachments dispatched. See attached log of execution warrants #77–134…”*

— excerpt from Case-file Monograph, Inhumation of Lady Clasis Hortva, Arbites Marshal Gregor Lund reporting
### **Background**
In the Imperium, totalitarian control and summary justice are often the norm rather than the exception, particularly among the teeming multitudes of a hive world. Minor criminals—vandals, drunkards, vagrants, trespassers, petty thieves, and their ilk—rarely see the inside of a court of law, not that most of them would have the means to pay for the services of a magistrate to advocate for their defence in the first place. The lawgivers, typically local enforcer cadres, are often authorised to mete out punishments on the spot, be they monetary forfeiture, confinement, some form of public humiliation, or just a modest taste of the boot and the truncheon. The great legal code, the Corpus Presidium Calixis, drafted by Drusus himself, specifies many such punishments and penalties for those who can't stay on the straight and narrow, and there are innumerable planetary and even regional laws and customs that could criminalise all sorts of conduct.

Generally speaking, more serious crimes—murder, sedition, obstruction of the Imperial tithe, theft of Adepta property, and so forth—are either punished with execution or very long incarceration. Although it is often perfunctory, a court is usually convened, and magistrates make their arguments for and against the guilt of the accused, present evidences, and partake in other acts of legal manoeuvring to get their desired outcome. If the accused is well-heeled or well-connected (and especially if they're both) this process can go on for quite a while, and the guilty sometimes go free over arcane technicalities and legal semantics.

In some cases, the authorities cannot allow that chance. The guilty must face the most severe sanction, urgently, before any other variables might derail the course of justice. Accordingly, both the Adeptus Arbites and many local enforcer cadres have need of hardened men and women whose talent lays in dealing death and summary execution, administering judgement before the frivolities of law can interfere. Singled out and specially trained to operate independently, both as snipers and close-quarter gunfighters,these specialists are commonly referred to as Mortiurges.

These troopers are typically drawn from enforcer kill squads under the direct jurisdiction of a ranking warden, or the feared Arbites Castigation Detachments tasked to deliver the Emperor’s wrath on the recidivist and those who would contravene Imperial Law without fear or favour.
Even among these cold-blooded killers, however, a Mortiurge would only be selected from those whose particular skill and callous dedication to their lethal duty makes them stand out from the rest of their fellow lawgivers.

By the nature of their work a Mortiurge works alone, singled out from his fellows by his differences in purpose, the blood on his hands, more often than not, a severe disaffection towards the normal process of law. In truth little more than judicially recognised assassins, they are often also employed to keep other lawgivers in check when needs require. As such, these singular killers are may be shunned by their colleagues and quickly learn to keep their distance, lest one day they be
called on to slaughter a friend who's been accused of a grievous misdeed and for whom facing a magistrate is far more than they deserve.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, some in the Holy Ordos, particularly members of its radical faction, whose doctrines and intrigues take them into direct and often covert conflict with the Imperium’s own authorities, find ready use for these highly efficient, if wholly disreputable, agents of order and social control. Inquisitors find unique advantage in a servant who is not only a highly trained killer, but who is also intimately familiar with law-enforcement procedures and willing to take out any target without passion or regret.
### **Becoming a Mortiurge**
Arbitrators who take on the role of the Mortiurge seldom do so voluntarily, as it makes them sanctioned assassins rather than servants of the law, but their presence in the Adeptus Arbites itself is considered by many a necessary evil. Those that do embrace becoming a Mortiurge often fall into two categories; the embittered and jaded veteran whose skills make them a valuable asset worth saving, perhaps despite their increasingly disruptive and rogue attitudes, and the cold-blooded killer, to whom the role of judge, jury and executioner appeals on some dark and fundamental level.

For enforcers, whose standards of morality and motivations are often notably more base than their Arbites counterparts, becoming a Moriturge could be seen as something of a promotion for those who enjoy kicking in doors more than taking bribes and beating hooligan juvies. Granted considerably greater freedom to act and persecute reprobates in their communities, the enforcer Mortiurge often goes about his work with an almost mirthful enthusiasm—from humble beginnings, he has become a law unto himself.

**Required Career:** Arbitrator, Assassin, Guardsman, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Unless the character is an Arbitrator, they must have the [Enforcer](background%20packages.md#enforcer) Background Package and be serving in such a cadre when this Alternate Career Rank is taken.

## **Ordo Sicarius Initiate**

"Some may be able to avoid the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites. Fewer may be able to face off against the Imperial Guard, and perhaps even the Adeptus Astartes. None can stand against the Officio Assassinorum."

— Tarik Ziz, Callidus Director Secundus
### **Background**
At the end of the Age of Apostasy and Goge Vandire’s despotic rule came a shadow conflict few have heard of and many participants did not survive: the Wars of Vindication within the Officio Assassinorum. The Officio had become riddled with corruption, and the Grand Master of Assassins was forced to kill many of its members in order to fully eliminate those still loyal to the deposed High Lord or who had fallen into irredeemable degeneracy during his rule. The Officio’s hierarchy was utterly shattered and needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, and for a time there was some discussion amongst the new High Lords that the Officio itself might be dissolved. 

As fellows of clandestine warfare, the Inquisition came to the Officio Assassinorum's aid during this moment of great peril. Following a thorough investigation and taking of accounts, Inquisitor Jaeger of the Ordo Hereticus deemed that a special order of the Inquisition would be created to help rebuild the Officio, and subsequently monitor and control some of its functions much more
closely than had occurred before. His proposal was accepted, and the Ordo Sicarius was created, with Jeager as its first Lord Inquisitor. As the Officio Assassinorum is a highly secretive branch of the Imperial hierarchy, Jeager and his henchmen understood that maintaining a typical hierarchy of control was out of the question. To preserve the Officio's ability to rive seamlessly through Imperial society the Ordo Sicarius would not maintain any formal structures outside it, instead fulfilling their duty by planting Assassin-Acolytes and, indeed, a few Inquisitors within their ranks. 

The masters of the Assassinorum know of the existence of these Ordo Sicarius agents, but not their number, postings, or individual identities. The Assassinorum and Sicarius follow an informal set of guidelines toward their unusual arrangement. Officially, the Officio Assassinorum does not attempt to expose or identify Sicarius agents, but those who are identified are marked and reported as such to their masters, who will withdraw and reassign the "made" agent. In return, if a Sicarius agent does uncover heresy or some dire conspiracy within the Assassinorum, the Ordo Sicarius will work in cooperation with the rest of the Officio to excise the malignant element with an absolute minimum disruption to their operations. Once a Sicarius agent is "made", his time secreted within the Officio Assassinorum is over, but the Inquisition has a great many other tasks that an expert at deception and guile could turn their hands to.

One notable example of the Ordo Sicarius' work dates from the early years of the 39th Millennium. Praetor Golgenna Angevin, a well-connected noble of the Terran Court, was raised to the rank of Lord Militant and granted a writ to prosecute a crusade to liberate and return the worlds of the Calyx Expanse to the Imperial fold. Among a cadre of Angevin's trusted counsellors and chamberlains was a man by the name of Dario Vereschagin. Unknown to Angevin or any of the others at the time, this servant was in actuality one Inquisitor Treyus Godan of the Ordo Sicarius. Inquisitor Godan's purpose was to monitor Angevin's crusade and to determine, on behalf of the Inquisition, whether or not such a singularly powerful individual was still loyal to the Imperium and faithfully executing the duties he was charged with. If he was not, then it was Godan's duty to eliminate him before Angevin turned the vast forces of the Crusade towards his own ends. A number of members of the Inquisition were openly serving in the forces of the Crusade, and could ostensibly fulfil the same purpose as Godan, but if the Lord Militant did betray the Imperium these badge-wearing agents and Inquisitors could conceivably be eliminated, or worse, co-opted. Godan, then, could serve as an additional measure to guarantee Angevin's loyalty. 

As the Crusade entered its third and final stage, Godan personally witnessed Angevin's acclaimed General Drusus slain by a rogue assassin. When Drusus rose from the dead, Godan was one of the first of the Crusade's leaders to recognise him as a living saint, a sure sign that the God-Emperor had blessed the Crusade's success with His divinity. Capitalising on this moment, Godan "revealed" himself as an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and officially (albeit without any sort of formal authorisation) declared the Inquisition's support of the new living saint. Reinvigorated by this moment of holy righteousness (and significant resources diverted by Inquisitorial forces) the Crusade barrelled ahead with newfound vigour, and most of the remaining worlds of Calyx were returned to the God-Emperor's light not long thereafter. Critically, by making the resurrection of Drusus a matter of Inquisitorial import, the conspirators who had him assassinated were outed, and the possibility of a religious schism over whether Drusus was truly a living saint or not was quickly put to rest before it could threaten the Crusade's revitalised momentum.

Godan, for his part, was censured for impersonating an Inquisitor, but received clemency in light of the undeniable results of his duplicity, and disappeared from the record shortly thereafter. Only a few within the Inquisition ever knew Godan was a member of the Ordo Sicarius, much less had been clandestinely monitoring the Crusade's progress and guiding the hands of its leaders the entire time. To this day, even many within the Holy Ordos are only vaguely aware of the existence of the Sicarius in the first place, but few would doubt their capability at deception and the crafting of cover identities for deep infiltration. Inquisitors whose work entails delicate and surreptitious investigation are often pleased to have an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius in their service, although some might give pause to the notion that the Sicarius-trained Acolyte could be keeping tabs on them at the same time...
### **Becoming an Ordo Sicarius Initiate**
Becoming an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius is no simple feat. The Acolyte in question must be both a skilled warrior and very capable at subterfuge. The vast majority of its members were chosen for induction by Assassin-Inquisitors of the Ordo Sicarius itself, the prospective initiates merely given a dataslate with the name of a target, and a stated goal of "Interrogation and Extermination required" written underneath. How, or even if, the prospect goes about this mission is his decision. Assuming the assignment is successfully completed, and the work is judged to be adequate, the prospect is clandestinely taken to the Ordo Sicarius' main temple and begins his training in the ways of the Assassin-Inquisitors.

Let’s not quibble about the price. You see, I know this up-hive guilder rolling in gelt, and he needs a little intel you may have the knowing of yourself…”*

— Obadiah Plex, Reclaimator, Hive Magnogorsk
### **Background**
Technology is a thing little understood and its workings lie shrouded in mystery and superstition for most of humanity. The Adeptus Mechanicus holds undisputed rights to the secret lore of science and technology, but the tech-priests themselves are comparably few in number, particularly when set against the teeming billions of the hive worlds or the isolated crews of ships plying the void. Such people rely on technological infrastructure in great profusion simply to live, be it a hive water-recyk system or a ship's thermal heaters. The ongoing low-grade maintenance of such petty systems, along with the day-to-day workings of the more sophisticated parts of a manufactora's machinery and the like are left to an army of technomats, functionaries, duct-crawlers, voidwalkers, and work-prefects gifted by their Mechanicus masters with just sufficient knowledge to perform their tasks with due deference and supplication to the machine-spirits and nothing more. These individuals are knowledgeable enough to know what do to in order to make the machine perform the desired functions, but neither why they do it or what actual functions occur within the innards of the machine itself.

Of this disparate group, some of the most skilled whilst simultaneously least trusted are the Reclaimators. It is their task to redeem raw materials from old and damaged systems, to scavenge useful parts from the detritus and wreckage, and in some cases perform minor repairs and refurbishment of technological devices, be they in-place or found in some perilous heap. By necessity, a Reclaimator's skills begin to stray into a higher understanding of machinery and technology than most, for their works frequently take them into the bowels of great technological artifices. Many learn to worship the Machine God in a fragmentary and superstitious manner, marking them apart from others—never a true subject of the Mechanicus, but far more knowledgeable about machine spirits and faithful to the precepts of the Omnissiah than most. Added to which, the Reclaimators themselves are often sent in to dangerous or unsafe areas with little in the way of direct supervision. Those that learn the necessary tricks of the trade to avoid all matters of unpleasant ways to die tend to become quite capable and independent operators. Most scavenge and salvage a good deal more than their masters know, and innumerable Reclaimators have "gone into business" for themselves, trading in technological wares from unassuming storefronts and pop-up stalls in market plazas. As a result, most Reclaimators have a reputation (entirely well-deserved by some) as suspicious, shifty characters who sell their skills and the items they retrieve or repair for a good profit on the black market. Many have links to criminal gangs, as obtaining mechanical goods through legitimate channels can be quite challenging for such malcontents, and the more ruthless are often willing to resort to robbery and even murder to build up their spoils as long as they think they can get away with it.

In the Calixis Sector, Reclaimators are common on all of the great hive worlds, where there is a nigh-endless amount of technological scrap waiting for the right hands to refurbish and return it to the Omnissiah's glory. Any technologically developed world will likely have at least some Reclaimators plying their trade, however, and even large voidships will likely have a few on board. Despite their arguably vital role in society, they rarely enjoy a good reputation, although in some places their ill-renown is more deserved than others. On war-ravaged Tranch, the men and women who make up the numerous Reclaimator scav-packs that prowl the ruins are often little more than murderous bandits weighed down by dead men's plunder and broken trinket-fetishes. Scintillan Reclaimators are one of the primary means by which the deadly narco-gangs seem to always have a reliable supply of weapons and equipment to terrorise the common citizens with. Among the void born it is no different; the wrecker crews of breaker-ships and junkers are considered untrustworthy and accursed of their kind, and the void families tell dark stories of death-scows, haunted vessels filled with scavengers driven to cannibalism and madness by want or by uncovering something best left alone in their desire for valuable salvage.

In one place in the Sector, perhaps perversely, the Reclaimator is held in high esteem: Fenksworld's nightmarish Hive Volg and that place is Volg. Here, where there is virtually no formal Adeptus Mechanicus presence, the Reclaimator’s knowledge is a vital part of sustaining life against the myriad hazards the hivers must struggle against on a daily basis. Given very little to work with in the city’s environs, the Reclaimators of Volg have a reputation for coming up with nearly miraculous (if often crazed and dangerous) solutions to keep things running, and ever more inventively salvaged weapons to drive away the bloated things crawling up from the depths. Some Administratum observers have pointed to the Reclaimators' unusual designs and the local worship of a debased form of the Machine God known as “Ironskull” to support a particular theory: it is supposed that Volg's highly capable Reclaimators are descended from rogue Tech-Priests exiled to that wretched place as a punishment in times past, and it is this influence that's enabled Volg to survive for as long as it has.
### **Becoming a Reclaimator**
Below the towering hive spires and within the vast iron canyons of Mechanicus forges scummers with a technically-minded bent, or just those who fancy themselves as dealmakers and traders, take up the shabby mantle of Reclaimator as a way to avoid more drudging labour, escape from under the crushing thumb of oppressive overseers, and seek fortune and adventure—or that's the idea, anyway. The reality of the Reclaimator's lot in life rarely matches up with the romanticised version seen in penthrift dreadfuls and the occasional holo-drama. However, for those with the wherewithal to avoid any of the almost limitless lethal dangers posed by decaying plasma stacks, half-collapsed industrial vaults, toxic air, and ravenous mutants, a Reclaimator's trade can be quite lucrative, especially compared to the sorts of "honest work" such a scummer might perform.

A Reclaimator can fall in with the Inquisition in any number of ways. Some catch the eye of an Inquisitor after acting as a guide for their Acolytes during a search for cultists, while others might be impressed—possibly against their will—after turning in a heretical construct or xenos artefact found during their normal labours. Often a cut above their kind in terms of intelligence and resourcefulness, a Reclaimator can make an excellent agent for infiltrating criminal gangs, contacting cult groups, and passing unobserved through the more squalid reaches of hive cities, while their void born brethren are just as useful aboard ship or working orbitals and dockyards.

## **Saboteur**

*"Any problem in the world can be solved with the careful application of high explosives. The trick is not to be around when they go off."*

— attributed to an ancient Terran warlord
### **Background**
 It is said by some of the more philosophically-minded Administratum thralls that everything within the Imperium is connected by endless invisible threads of interdependence, a vast web of commerce, trade, and movement of men that binds the whole together. From the astropathic messages brought to the table of a lord, to the food eaten by the lowest worker in a forge, all depends on something else to exist, and those in turn on other things. These threads of reliance form a vast entanglement of power and stability on which order, faith, and indeed survival itself depends. It is the destruction of these threads that is the Saboteur’s purpose, and for many, their most beloved art.

Saboteurs are craftsmen of panic, destruction, and downfall—sometimes all three at once! They are the loosed dogs of secret wars of destabilisation and terror that rage in the shadows of the Imperium of Mankind. Trained to move unseen amongst the great flocks of humanity, the Saboteur is a faceless agent of fear, mayhem, and death that attacks the physical and psychological fabric that binds the Imperium together. Many act as tools or proxies of larger conspiracies, sowing fear among the people and crippling the local authorities' means to resist the hideous plans of the Saboteur's employers. Others ply their trade for their own goals alone, seeking to topple institutions and spires out of personal animus for the rulers and powerful, or even just for the perverse joy of destruction itself.

Acolytes of the Inquisition are most likely to encounter a Saboteur in the course of an investigation, and will almost certainly be attempting to thwart the Saboteur's plans before they can threaten the very fabric of Imperial society. Yet, it is also not unheard-of for such cold monsters of terror to be found in the service of an Inquisitor. While unconventional in the main, it is true that grand conspiracies and heretical sects often depend on their own networks of information and material to enact their vile plots. Once uncovered, these can be severed with explosives and other clandestine, underhanded tactics just as easily, if not more so, than with a Storm Trooper deployment or a raid by an Arbites Suppression Squad. 

Sometimes a very deeply-rooted heresy can corrupt planetary authorities to its will or ephemerally secret itself within local institutions, becoming all but undetectable to even the all-seeing eye of the Inquisition. In such situations, a more radical Inquisitor might set loose Saboteur Acolytes to destabilise those very organisations, depriving the heretics of the facade of normality and pushing them out into the open. The cost in both infrastructure and innocent lives is often high, but those who would deliberately send an entire hive into anarchy to expose dire conspiracies within its guild halls and enforcer forts are quick to point out that a more "conventional", that is to say brute force, approach would likely be even worse.
### **Becoming a Saboteur**
A Saboteur's qualifications are deceptively simple: move surreptitiously and cause a great deal of targeted destruction. A Saboteur Acolyte will often lean on the training and institutional knowledge of his existing Career to identify structural and organisational weaknesses, areas where a little explosives or poison gas will have outsize effects on the body he's been called to cripple. No two Saboteurs are alike, and such an Acolyte is just as likely to be a dutiful servant calmly practising a trade for his master as he is to be a barely-contained menace, gleefully terrorising his fellow men with official justification that's often entirely too flimsy.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp).

## **Slate-Agent**

*"And who am I to be this year, hmm? A wealthy functionary in a dubious merchant guild? No? Hmm, perhaps a pampered Ecclesiastic keeping watch for detestable heresy within a suspect sect? Still no, eh? Well then, can I spend the majority of this mission indoors at least? Another Imperial Guard unit? How do heretics keep managing to sneak into those! Well at least I won't remember any of it after retrieval..."*

— a Slate-Agent, currently named Cavel Posdanik
### **Background**
On the planet of Malfi, a place often considered the "second capital" of the Calixis Sector, the men and women of the ruling class play a vicious game of politics and favour. This game is played not on any game-board, but in every palace, mansion, and villa. It is not played with pieces, but with the livelihood of their dynasties. The strategy of this game lies with political manoeuvring and favourable alliances. The stakes of this game are neither bragging rights nor pride, they are the very existence of the noble family, and the rights of rulership. The greatest advantage in this game of political infighting is information, preferably that which could shame and discredit a rival. In the pursuit of this sort of information the noble houses of Malfi have each developed methods particular to their own dynasty. It was for this purpose that the first Slate-Agents were trained. The Malfian house which first created the Slate-Agents is long forgotten, whether fallen to obscurity or risen to heights beyond all recognition, none can say. What is well known, however, is the efficacy of the Slate-Agent as a spy and operative. The secrets of creating a Slate-Agent escaped the Malfian backstabber-lords over a century ago, and other powerful organisations in Calixis—namely the Inquisition and the Adeptus Arbites—are known to employ these unique savant-moles for deep undercover work.

Masters of subterfuge and disguise, each Slate-Agent is a perfect operative of infiltration and observation. It is the gruelling process of their creation which makes a Slate-Agent so optimally crafted for their intended job. The first stage of a Slate-Agent's conditioning is aimed at wholly annihilating any sense of self possessed by the recruit, reducing them to little more than a biological machine in the service of their masters. It is from this state that Slate-Agents receive  heir moniker, as from this point forward, each Agent is a "blank-slate" on which new identities can be written. To achieve this, recruits are deprived of sleep, food, water, and dignity, as well as forced to endure horrific psychological torments, all the while they are watched for signs of opposition or rebelliousness. Once the recruit has been reduced to an entirely pliant and workable state, the trainers begin the slow process of rebuilding their charge. Using incredibly complex and methodical hypno-indoctrination techniques they prepare the recruit's mind to take shape around cover-identities, each of which includes skills, history, profession, and contacts, as well as personality and mannerisms, all combined to provide a flawless cover for the Slate-Agent. The trainers use psycho-conditioning to thread the recruit's psyche with triggers and fail-safes, in order to reset the conditioning once their mission is complete. Oft-times the conditioning of Slate-Agents is so complete that during their missions they are wholly unaware of their true identity until their loyalty is tested, at which point, deep-planted hypno-barriers close off the mind to any possibility of traitorous or mutinous thoughts.

Gathering information about one's target is the primary directive of each Agent. Infiltrating a targeted organisation, gaining access to its members' most heavily guarded secrets, and leaving no doubt as to their unfaltering loyalty to their target, these are the core objectives of each Slate- Agent's mission. The specifics may change depending on the Slate-Agent's controller and his targeted organisation, but information is the primary stock and trade of the Slate-Agent. For Malfian agents, having an ally so flawlessly inserted into an enemy's ranks often proves a dangerous temptation, for it is a simple thing to include a kill-order alongside the multitude of mundane orders during the templating process. This form of assassination is harshly frowned upon by the Malfian courts, although only because it would swiftly become a form of mutually assured destruction were this practice to become accepted. For Slate-Agents employed by other organisations, of course, there's often far less hesitation to deploy such an operative for both intelligence-gathering and murder should the opportunity arise.

Malfian Slate-Agents are often considered to be costly but ultimately disposable tools of espionage, meant to be deeply secreted within a rival house to feed information to their masters for as long as possible. Given the ever-changing nature of Inquisitorial work, those Slate-Agents who have been conditioned for use by agents of the Inquisition are often more aware of their true identity, at least subconsciously, and have even been known to have been templated with a multitude of identities at the same time. Slate-Agents in the employ of an Inquisitor can be seen as more of a deck of cards, able to flawlessly shift into a different cover identity as the needs of the mission dictate. This makes them an exceptional weapon to infiltrate corrupt organisations and heretical cults, and unlike the Malfian power-players, the Inquisition is absolutely not above utilising a Slate-Agent to terminate key members of a group they've been secreted into.
### **Becoming a Slate-Agent**
There is no set procedure by which men and women are chosen to become Slate-Agents. Functionally a softer form of mind-cleansing, the process is still painful and harrowing, and only the most absolutely devoted, penitent, or deranged would wholly volunteer to undergo the templating. Many Slate-Agents are coerced into the role by their masters, while others are all but forced to be "slated" as a form of penance for a severe failure. Inquisitors with a more whimsical idea of justice have been known to compel spies who have been caught infiltrating Inquisitorial properties or organisations to accept becoming a Slate-Agent. This allows the outsider to turn their existing talents at subterfuge to the Inquisition's benefit while giving a very effective guarantee of their loyalty to their new masters.

Upon becoming a Slate-Agent, the character gains the **Blank Slate Trait**.

**Required Career**: Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** [Unremarkable](talents.md#unremarkable) Talent
#### **Trait: Blank Slate**
The Acolyte is imprinted with several psychic triggers, known only to his handler. These triggers serve as prompts for the Slate-Agent’s identity programming. One trigger wipes the Slate-Agent’s mind clean of previous imprinting. Another prepares the Agent’s mind for re-programming. When a Slate-Agent is imprinted, the GM and the player may choose three [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore), [Forbidden Lore](skills.md#forbidden%20lore), [Scholastic Lore](skills.md#scholastic%20lore), or [Trade](skills.md#trade) Skills appropriate for the Acolyte’s cover identity. Until the Agent’s imprinting is wiped clean, the Slate-Agent is considered to possess all chosen Skills, and gains a +10 bonus on related Tests.

While an Acolyte's cover identity is "active" the Acolyte completely and totally believes himself to be that person, and even successful [Interrogation](skills.md#interrogation) will only reveal details about the Acolyte's templated persona. Psychic Powers such as [Mind Scan](telepathy.md#mind%20scan) will still reveal the Acolyte's actual identity and the fact that he's had a different identity templated onto him, however. The Acolyte loses all memories of his time under the active cover identity once the trigger is given to wipe his templating, so it is absolutely essential to fully debrief the Slate-Agent before attempting to prepare a new cover identity.

The triggers used to prepare and wipe a Slate-Agent's persona templates must remain absolutely secret, known only to the controller. Should the triggers become known to anyone else that party could implant their own template onto the Slate-Agent, possibly turning him against his masters or to some other no-doubt nefarious purpose.

## **Suffering Marshal**

*"You eluded me in Port Suffering. Your trail was faint through the wastelands, but I caught wind of your passing at Misk. You stayed out of sight, but your comrades let slip your destination before I gave them the justice of my boltgun. Finally, I find you here. You have run as far as you can, Vai Los, but you shall elude me no longer. Justice belongs to the God-Emperor, but your death shall be mine."*

— Stavlar Dorian, Suffering Marshal
### **Background**
Iocanthos is a harsh and brutal world, known for its chief export of Ghostfire, a crop used in the manufacture of the combat drug Frenzon, among other pharmacological compounds. Many lawless criminals and scoundrels make use of the vast stretches of untamed wild and the feuding warlords to evade prosecution and cheat the fate they so rightfully deserve. Iocanthos' unique political and social situation does not simply benefit "native" lawbreakers either. With multiple stable warp routes from Scintilla, Fenksworld, and Sepheris Secundus, bustling voidship traffic to and from Iocanthos permits many more skilled and resourceful fugitives across the Golgenna Reach to flee there in the hopes of going to ground from whatever authorities are in pursuit.

Port Suffering, the only developed Imperial city on Iocanthos, features a small Adeptus Arbites precinct house with a modest contingent of Arbitrators who serve a tour of duty for a few years before being rotated out to other postings. This Arbites presence is largely a matter of oversight of Iocanothos' spaceport and its brokering houses, ensuring the all-important Ghostfire export, which makes up the lion's share of Iocanthos' Imperial tithe, goes out without interruption. However, the world's growing reputation as a haven for wanted men, including some of the most irredeemable criminals in Calixis, has spurred the birth of an unorthodox sort of Arbitrator: the so-called Suffering Marshal.

With its sprawling steppes and deep, primeval forests, there is no shortage of wilderness a man who deeply desires to not be found could hide out. Furthermore, numerous warbands of techno-barbarians, vying for supremacy and the right to harvest the Ghostfire, are typically more than happy to hire on any of the more bloodthirsty recidivists, and they rarely give much countenance to a lawman bearing a warrant. It takes a stalwart and resourceful agent to track down this sort of criminal—a man whose dedication to the Imperium and its laws drives him on, alone, for as long as it takes to catch those who have so far eluded justice. This can often take months of arduous tracking and isolation from civilisation, forcing any who would take up this honourable if thankless task to be resourceful, quick thinking, and absolutely loyal to their purpose.

For this reason, only those Arbitrators with specific qualities are chosen for the testing rank of Suffering Marshal—those steadfast in their love of the law, those who have shown an aptitude for the hunt, a cunning mind, and a ready willingness to adapt to any situation or environment. It is these sorts of men and women who are chosen by their superiors to hunt down and mete out justice to those who could treat Iocanthos as a refuge for their wickedness.

Obviously, the Suffering Marshal represents a necessary deviation from typical Adeptus Arbites practices. The world's unique crop and tottering stability created by King Skull make larger military actions questionable—a crack suppression squad from a Scintillan precinct fort would likely find itself slowly ground down by the elements and ruthless marauding warriors eager to claim their gleaming wargear before they could ever hope to find their man. However, unlike most off-worlders, King Skull and many other Vai respect the authority of the Suffering Marshals, viewing them as closer to their own rough-riding warrior ethos and at least tolerating their presence whilst on the hunt for a wanted evildoer.

Granted wide jurisdiction through the whole of the planet, Suffering Marshals are free from the usual bureaucracy and oversight of the traditional Adeptus Arbites as handed down from the Grand Marshal Provost on Holy Terra. This gives a Suffering Marshal a great deal of personal discretion in so far as how he goes about his duties, which on Iocanthos is an absolute necessity of his work. Despite their noble intentions, and the undeniable results of their dogged pursuit of the fugitive, the mere existence of the Suffering Marshals is still quite controversial within the Calixian Arbites. The legalistic traditionalists consider them dangerous, buoyed by such operational leeway and free-thinking that a Suffering Marshal is liable to become a law unto himself, a violent predator hunting for thrills instead of a dispassionate lawgiver. Lord Marshal Goreman has so far opted not to weigh in on either side of the so-called "Iocanothos Question", reticent to risk a doctrinal split between the conservative judges who view the law as a matter of sacred dogma and their more liberal, often younger cohorts that want to get their man at any cost. Judge Porvin, the Suffering Marshals' staunchest advocate, has so far managed to avoid inflaming this controversy by only allowing the most steadfastly loyal and even-keeled Arbitrators to claim the rank.

As it is a Suffering Marshal's duty to put to death those who have already been pronounced guilty by Imperial courts, they are notoriously unconcerned with evidence-gathering procedure and some of the more florid aspects of the Lex Imperialis. Their talents and training lie largely within the scope of tracking their prey, driving them to ground, and overcoming them in violent confrontation. For this reason, Suffering Marshals tend to be straightforward, inelegant individuals, often considered violent and thuggish by already heavy-handed Arbitrators and virtually subhuman by Arbites Adepts. This is also likely the result of the theatre of operation in which they exist—a harsh frontier populated by hard-bitten Imperial citizens, primitive techno-barbarian marauders, and, of course, fugitive malcontents. In such an unforgiving environment and among such no-nonsense people, elegance and pretension are signs of weakness, not authority. In the end, the Suffering Marshal must be a very capable man-at-arms, as his canny quarry is almost never going to gracefully accept judgement when the Marshal inevitably catches up to him.
### **Becoming a Suffering Marshal**
The Suffering Marshal is often a loner, accustomed to working alone or with largely informal networks of informants, and they rarely cross paths with Inquisitorial agents in the field. A true Suffering Marshal is unlikely to be scouted for service in an Inquisitor's retinue—these Arbitrators take their charge very seriously, and few would abandon the hunt for a wanted man for adventure and intrigue with the Inquisition. Their reputation as ruthless and highly effective man-catchers, however, is far from unknown to the Holy Ordos, especially as other Arbites forces around Calixis have begun to accept veteran Suffering Marshals into their ranks.

Some more ambitious Inquisitors have been known to send cadres of their Acolytes to train under a Suffering Marshal, aiding the Marshal with his task and learning some of the unique approaches to tracking and field investigation the Marshals are known for. These agents are jokingly called "Suffering Fools" by the Arbites, but the animosity is largely superficial, and all but the most churlish Marshals tend to be happy to educate the Acolytes in exchange for their assistance. Once they've successfully demonstrated the ability to take down a fugitive the Acolytes are considered to be Suffering Marshals in all but name.

**Required Careers:** Arbitrator, Assassin, Guardsman, or Scum
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** [Shadowing](skills.md#shadowing) and [Tracking](skills.md#tracking) Skills. Acolytes must have previously tracked down a dangerous fugitive or aid a Suffering Marshal in doing so.

## **Tyrantine Shadow Agent**

*"Lest the truth devour all."*

— Memento Mori of Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos
### **Background**
The Inquisition, some say, is an empire of secrets. To outsiders, this is certainly the case, for in stern judgement and shrouded in mystery the Holy Ordos sit above them like wrathful gods, little understood and rightly feared. But what is not so widely known by outsiders is that there are many secrets the Inquisition keeps from its own, either because it is expedient to do so, or because they are simply too dangerous even for some members of the Ordos to know. These secrets are often held through invisible webs of patronage, fealty and alliance, but sometimes manifest themselves though shadow empires: whole organisations hidden under the wider umbrella of the Holy Ordos whose nature and concerns remain mysterious even to other Inquisitors and Acolytes.

Inside the Calixian Conclave, there is no greater divider than the Hereticus Tenebrae, more informally known as the Tyrant Star, and the Tyrantine Cabal is one such secretive and insular group striving to uncover the true nature of its menace. The supreme danger of the Star is not known to all even within the Inquisition’s own ranks. Even those who do know something rarely have anything but a piece of the puzzle, and there are many who dismiss the calamitous phenomena of the Tyrant Star as mere coincidence or superstitions. In no small part, the Tyrantine Cabal is responsible for maintaining this ignorance, just as much as it is investigating what the Hereticus Tenebrae represents and how to combat it.

As the years have progressed, this web of secrecy and control has taken on a life almost of its own, and methods and agencies have sprung up to support it and its master’s goals. One such powerful agency is the Tenebrae Collegium—a shadow empire all of its own founded by the cynical genius of the renowned Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. The Collegium takes the most promising and suitable of Acolytes and transforms them into subtle and lethal instruments of deception, whose true allegiances can remain secret even from the Inquisitors they serve. These Acolytes are perfectly suited to keeping the Tyrantine Cabal's purposes hidden and enacting its will without remorse or apprehension. The existence of the Collegium and its so-called “shadow agents” is a matter officially denied by the Cabal and the source of much secret debate, suspicion, and contentious enmity within the Conclave Calixis as a whole. How far does its reach stretch? How many agents does it have? And what darkness might go undiscovered lurking at the heart of such a strange and hidden power? Few know, but many outside the Cabal have grave misgivings, and it is entirely likely that its most entrenched detractors have fashioned their own secret networks to oppose the Tyrantines' scheming.

It is said Cassilda Cognos once quipped, in a moment of levity, that the Collegium “took outstanding dissemblers and accomplished liars and then began their work”. Certainly, the results of the Collegium’s conditioning do produce agents more than capable of moving through the Imperium in a carefully woven fog of falsity and misdirection. Using tiny gestures, key words and cadences, two agents can communicate vital information in the presence of others who remain none the wiser. Furthermore, using psychic and mental conditioning, a graduate of the Collegium can close his mind to all but the most destructive psychic probing, concealing his deepest secrets around a labyrinth of half truths and falsity to confuse, making them not only extraordinarily proficient spies and agents, but near-impregnable living vaults for the secrets of the Cabal.

The ultimate purpose of these Tyrantine agents is to firstly hold the Cabal above all other masters, to pursue knowledge of the Tyrant Star, and to keep that knowledge safe from all outside the Cabal’s covetous circle. In most cases, these goals coincide with the agent’s duties as Acolytes of the Ordos Calixis. However, where their true loyalties have come into conflict with the Adepta or even immediate superiors outside of the Cabal, this has led to cold and brutal conflict with those the agent would ordinarily call their lords, comrades, or even friends. So far, the Cabal has managed to keep all such “difficulties” from wider knowledge. The time may come, though, when the fate of all is at stake and they will have to act no matter what the cost. Perhaps a civil war will erupt within the Ordos Calixis as a result. This is a nightmare, however, that this secret empire, this order within an order, must bear, for their own fearful secrets are as nothing to the dangers of the Hereticus Tenebrae, and some must be sacrificed lest its truth devour all.
### **Becoming a Tyrantine Shadow Agent**
The path of the Tyrantine Shadow Agent is to be a spy among spies, his true loyalties hidden from his ostensible master. Shadow Agents are always vigilant for any new information about the Tyrant Star they can acquire, and then just as driven to jealously guard it from the prying eyes of those outside the Cabal. By default this demands the Shadow Agent conspire against the trust of his master and his fellow Acolytes, keeping his ultimate objectives hidden from any not deemed worthy of the Cabal's dread knowledge. An Acolyte being revealed as a Shadow Agent would face formal censure from their Inquisitor at best, and could suffer a far worse fate if their master is a more vindictive or covetous soul. For those who maintain their clandestine charge, however, loyal service to their true masters will in time reward them with ascension to the Cabal's inner ranks, and with it, the terrible insight of the threat posed by the Hereticus Tenebrae.

Taking this Alternate Career Rank is not just a matter of passing the xp requirements, it means that you have been singled-out by the Tyrantine Cabal to advance their hideously secretive ambitions. Advancing into this Career makes you a conspirator and subject to the Tyrantine Cabal’s secret orders and goals, and should only be selected if the contrivances of the Tyrant Star figure in to the development of your campaign. As always, consult with your GM and determine whether this Alternate Career Rank is appropriate.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

## **Warp Dabbler**

*"She would have been just a petty recidivist and peddler of harm, one of countless souls of no great worth, but then the warp found her, and she became a true monster. However, as she is a monster loyal to me, you and I are now in conflict."*

— Radical Inquisitor Soldevan to Judge Hiram Fulk of the Adeptus Arbites
##### **Background**
Warp Dabblers, sometimes referred to as warplocks and petty sorcerers, are individuals tampering—often quite nesciently—with the malignant arts of the warp sorcery. Whether cultists, noncompliants, recidivists, or amoral academics, these individuals have had contact with forbidden knowledge and have decided to further explore the possibilities it can offer. These are not true sorcerers or savants of the forbidden, but instead are dark-hearted warriors, soiled enforcers, spiteful adepts, and twisted killers who have acquired a degree of warp lore and have made the perilous decision to put it into use for their own gain. Although they may never achieve the terrible heights of occult power and knowledge that the true masters of sorcery can, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing—especially in the hands of often-desperate individuals on the fringes of society.

Warp Dabblers may have walked almost any path before they begin their dalliance with warp craft. In the case of recidivists and other minor heretics, they may be cultists, criminals, smugglers, or even gang bosses. Others could, at least nominally, be on the straight and narrow, including lesser academics, occultists, and even noble scions. The intelligence and strength of will to study the forbidden is not something that all can do, but should one with the potential be presented with tantalisingly proscribed power, he will often seize it and put it to imaginative (and horrible) use.

Blessedly, the sorts of fell knowledge that could start one down the path of the Warp Dabbler are not easy to obtain. The Imperium is, in general, an insular and ignorant society, and this is just as much by design as it is by cultural norms. The Ecclesiarchy constantly preaches rhetoric designed to inspire dogmatic obedience and abject abhorrence of the heretical and the unknown in equal measure, while the Imperial Inquisition considers censoring and limiting the spread of information considered dangerous or corrupting an absolutely vital task. To the average Imperial citizen, a formal education in academic subjects is a luxury, daemons are distant horrors portrayed in morality plays, and the warp is more of an abstraction of antipathetic feelings than a very real place of unadulterated power and anarchy.

In this social climate, it is onerous to say the least to obtain texts or information about daemonology, the occult, and the immaterium, but it is by no means impossible either. There are few things more consistent in human nature than the desire to possess that which is proscribed or
unobtainable. In the darkest corners of Imperial society—and often its loftiest heights too—banned texts, forbidden tomes, and other instructions in warp craft can be bought, traded, and stolen by someone with the right connections or resources. Tragically, some even find their way into the hands of completely unwitting souls who, in a moment of weakness, turn away from the Ecclesiarchy's blessed ignorance and furtively turn the pages of madness and damnation.

It is an unfortunate irony that the Imperium’s tireless efforts to suppress perilous malefic knowledge mean those who do manage to obtain such information often have little real understanding of just how dangerous it can be. To them, the rituals and incantations are just another tool to obtain their goals, or worse, an amusing frivolity with the supernatural bearing no great significance at all. Only when it is far, far too late, and the leering eyes and grinning mouths of thirsting gods are upon him, does the average Warp Dabbler realise how profoundly his actions have doomed him.

This is not to say, however, that Warp Dabblers are not formidable foes. On the contrary, those who survive long enough, avoiding detection by the Imperial authorities and destruction or insanity from the dread tomes they ply, often possess a combination of low cunning, resourcefulness, and ruthless connivance which makes them quite competent adversaries. In addition, the warp-fueled powers and daemonic allies they can draw on makes them even more dangerous, especially when cornered or desperate. Warp Dabbling crime bosses may take down their rivals with horrors summoned from the warp, while assassins may use sorcery to pass unseen and so eliminate the most heavily guarded of targets with ease. Cultists may attract their followers with forbidden pleasures and dark rewards, while protecting their secrecy with hexes and malefic curses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Warp Dabbler is thus a common quarry for servants of the Inquisition, a burgeoning moral threat who grows in power and danger every day he's left to further hone his hideous craft.

For Inquisitors of a more radical persuasion, cornering a Warp Dabbler who isn't already "too far gone" could be a profitable prospect. A Warp Dabbling Acolyte can call on his knowledge of the dark arts to defeat his opponents, gain a better understanding of their motives and operations, or even bend the powers of the warp against its own vile denizens when they manifest in the materium. When facing the prospect of execution, or worse, few Warp Dabblers would reject a radical Inquisitor's sanction to make something worthwhile of their lives, and with it, perhaps earn redemption in the eyes of the God-Emperor.
### **Becoming a Warp Dabbler**
An Acolyte requires both motive and opportunity to become a Warp Dabbler. At a minimum, the Acolyte must have a source from which he could acquire profane knowledge of the warp, along with the necessary moral flexibility to heedlessly study such subjects and their dire portents. The Acolyte’s Inquisitor might be a source of such possibility, as could contact with warp cults or forbidden tomes, perhaps made during the course of an investigation. Once the Acolyte chooses to dabble in the proscribed, he must spend an amount of time studying or being tutored—usually taking a few months, although a fast reader could conceivably do it quicker—during which time the Acolyte gains 2d10 Corruption Points.
