## **Acuitor Mech-Assassin**

*“We still have no explanation for the death of the passenger. The only witness claims the void-lock unexpectedly opened just as that poor soul walked nearby, while the outer lock was also open. For both to be open is impossible when the auspex registers open void against the hull, yet it happened. I doubt we will ever know why he was so desperate to leave that system, though I am relieved he did pay in advance.”*

— Captain Artesia Carnelline, *Killian’s Prize*
### **Background**
Killers come in all sizes and shapes. Some silent and subtle, others brazen. Some clad in flesh, some in cloth, and some in steel. There are countless orders dedicated to the art of death in the Calixis Sector. Some are quite well known, even to the common citizens, while others are entirely secretive and cryptic. One of the most deadly and simultaneously most obscure among them is the Acuitor Set of the Lathes—informally, the Mech-Assassins. These executioners are answerable only to Magisters Samadhi of their own order, and usually move according to their masters’ will without scrutiny, hidden beneath the Tech-Priest's heavy red robes. Though most are trained in the art of stealth, initiates of the Acuitor Set often infiltrate in plain sight; after all, the Priesthood of Mars is a wholly inscrutable order to all but the most knowledgeable outsiders, and even the greatest citizens across the Calixis Sector do well to treat these strange, mechanical half-men with an appropriate level of reverence and fear. It is rare for lay folk to question the actions of even a lowly initiate of the Adeptus Mechanicus, odd or arcane as his behaviours may be, and so the Acuitors pass, seen, but ignored. To anyone but the great lords of the Machine Cult, and certain individual Inquisitors with close ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus (or bitter enemies within it), nothing distinguishes an Acuitor Mech-Assassin from the shuffling, augmented, and veiled ranks of Tech-Priests who fulfil the innumerable duties that allow the Imperium to grind forward one more day. Nothing, at least, until it is far too late. It is, in no small part, this anonymity-in-plain-sight that makes the Acuitor Set so very deadly.

During the days of the Angevin Crusade, a pious Magos by the name of Samadhi led his modest forces to several key victories in the Mechanicus’ grand campaign against the Adrantians in what would eventually become the heartland of the Calixis Sector. After the Grant of the Lathes in 380.M39, when the Lathe Worlds were granted to the Cult Mechanicus for their efforts in the Crusade, Samadhi used his new-wrought influence to form a secret organisation. Some stories say that this was with the tacit permission of the already-powerful Lords Dragon, based on a promise of future service to their cause. He then trained and dedicated the members of this sub-cult to the art of eliminating the enemies of the Omnissiah. Samadhi established the hidden fortresses scattered throughout the realm of the Lathes, such as Rasamal on Lathe-Hesh and Tumala in the heart of the shrouded Panopticon, in which his disciples could be sharpened into perfect tools of death in the Omnissiah's name.

It is whispered that, one day, Samadhi himself vanished into the depths of the archive of Tumala. Perhaps he was finally betrayed by the frailty of flesh, or he became one with the ancient cogitators contained in the fortress, his numerous augmetics absorbed into a great agglomeration of techno-artifice—it is likely none know the truth. No matter the circumstances of his departure, Samadhi’s disciples rallied around the data-tracts that the first Grand Magister of the Acuitor Set left in his wake. His adherents believe that these data-tracts, based on recordings of his own cogitations, contain his ultimate scheme—a plan in which all disciples participate, but that none fully understand. Decanting his stored knowledge into their own minds, the agents of the Acuitor Set followed in their patron’s footsteps and tirelessly hunted any they saw as obstacles to the Adeptus Mechanicus.

Starting with the first disciples to succeed the patron of the Acuitor Set, all those who have claimed the title of Magister within the organisation have taken on the cognomen “Magister Samadhi” upon their ascension to this elevated rank. Through them, Samadhi’s name has become an expression for death itself within the Calixian Mechanicus.

In this day and age, the Acuitor Set has quietly expanded, and though its members are still fleetingly rare, there are several worlds upon which they recruit those gifted in treading the Omnissiah’s darker paths. Most of the recruits are already experienced Tech-Priests, specifically those who have already had to call upon their unique skills to slay their foes, either because of battlefield appointments, poor luck, or a logical reason that required violent conflict. After passing rigorous trials, recruits are infused with the data-tracks of the order’s long-gone founder. Though recruits remain individuals, each carries a part of the vast, calculating mind that spun the Acuitor Set into being. With the knowledge contained in the ancient data-tracks, all Acuitor Mech-Assassins can act according to a single, immense plan without ever setting eyes on other agents after their training or even grasping the true extent of the design. The labours of all become one in the shadows, casting the grim silhouette of Magister Samadhi over the Calixis Sector long ages after body ceased to function.

So it is that these disguised agents roam the sector, maintaining voidships, repairing cogitators, unjamming weapons, and occasionally—when no one is looking—slaughtering their unsuspecting targets. The methods by which a Mech-Assassin can kill are varied; some value a clean kill at a distance, while others prefer to slay with elaborately created traps or carefully scripted malfunctions. Few in number, but possibly the most terrifying of all, are those who like to feel the “wet-iron” of their victims run in crimson rivulets down their bladed mechadendrites and cybernetic limbs. These Acuitors often train themselves to enter a state of terrible frenzy on command, flooding their minds with the Samadhi data-tracts that it might guide their movements in the thick of battle. This practice makes them fearless in the knowledge that all proceeds according to the Grand Magister’s plan. These counterpoints—clinical, razor-sharp forethought, and savage battle-fury—balance to make a fully trained Acuitor Mech-Assassin one of the deadliest individuals in the whole of Calixis.

Regardless of what wargear they bear, the sharpest weapon an Acuitor possesses is his mind. Whenever possible, an Acuitor elaborately plans a kill, running simulation after simulation in his augmented cranium and including a wide array of factors that few without the gifts of the Omnissiah could effectively consider. He might stalk his target for months or years at a time, gathering ever more information to be filed away for his grim purpose. An Acuitor Mech-Assassin’s honed, clicking mind allows him to utilise nearly anything as a lethal weapon; steam pipes become a scalding trap to an unwary passer-by, a firearm becomes a timebomb for its user, and an ancient cogitator becomes a shadowy maze from which a known Heretek’s mind cannot escape, even as his body sits helpless before it. Even if he cannot kill with his surroundings, an Acuitor might depressurise a voidship’s cabin or redirect a reactor’s vent into a nearby air duct, all to force an enemy into a vulnerable position. Infinite possibilities for murder unfold before a member of the Acuitor Set, and finding the best one for an enemy of the Omnissiah is simply his role in the great Quest for Knowledge.
### **Becoming an Acuitor Mech-Assassin**
Tech-Priests who are chosen to become Acuitors are pulled from across the Lathes and beyond, and instructed in secret fortresses scattered throughout the Calixis Sector, such as Tumala and Rasamal. Most candidates are those who have proven both faithful and capable of using the skills of the Adeptus Mechanicus to deadly—and subtle—effect. To become an Acuitor is to become a part of a pattern greater than oneself, as all members of the Set mentally carry the data-tracts of Magister Samadhi, which guide them to the targets of their wrath and aid them in making short work of those who oppose the Lathes. Those who can survive the weight of the data-tracts and even begin to decipher the ancient, inscrutable memories, become killers of the greatest calculable efficiency and ruthlessness.

#### **Talent: Cogs Within Cogs**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 35
An Acuitor Mech-Assassin who interfaces with any machine may make Test [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use). If he succeeds, he may pre-set that machine to activate, deactivate, or follow another such simple protocol within its usual repertoire, at either a given time within the next 24 hours, or upon his remote command. In the latter case, he must be within a number of kilometres equal to his Intelligence Bonus of the machine when he wishes to activate it. The Acuitor must choose the machine’s action upon making his Tech-Use Test, and makes any other necessary Tests (such as [Security](skills.md#security) to bypass a guarded cogitator’s internal defences or [Forbidden Lore (Archeotech)](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) to decipher an ancient device’s function) while programming the action.
#### **Talent: Whisper of Samadhi**
**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 35, Deceive, Mimic
Consummate infiltrators, an Acuitor Mech-Assassin have little trouble passing as normal Tech- Priests when dealing with commoners across the Sector. Of course, their targets are hardly limited to those outside of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Part of the ancient data tracks of Samadhi helps them to overcome this problem, however. When dealing with other Tech-Priests, an Acuitor may lace portions of the Secret Archive of Samadhi into his binaric cant, subtly scrambling the judgement of the listener. As such, when dealing with other Tech-Priests, Acuitor Mech-Assassins may use their Intelligence Characteristic instead of their Fellowship when using the [Deceive](skills.md#deceive) Skill, and may use the [Mimic](talents.md#mimic) Talent to copy the subtleties of the vocal codes and ciphers of any Tech-Priest they impersonate with it.
## **Agent of the Lords Dragon**

*“The phrase 'be seeing you' has a different meaning for us, Inquisitor Caidin. When we say this, it is to be taken quite literally.”*

— Arch-Magos Karolinious Benz, Magos-Draco of the Lords Dragon
### **Background**
Shrouded in mystery, and whispered about only by fools and madmen, is the legend of the Panopticon. Supposedly hidden deep within the Lathes System, this orbiting void station is rumoured to be the real authority behind the Calixian Mechanicus, and the seat of power for an organisation whose name is synonymous with dread: the Lords Dragon.

Dispatched to the then-unconquered Calix Expanse thousands of years ago through Logis-Prophesies, secretive Tech-Priests sought out worlds to eventually bring under Mechanicus control. They were to locate any sites that would be advantageous once the upcoming Angevin Crusade had finished, and to ensure that the Mechanicus claimed the most important worlds as their own, before the Adeptus Ministorum gained a foothold in the new Sector. The first agents to arrive quickly discovered a small system colonised aeons ago during Mankind’s earliest steps into the galaxy. The irregular orbits of its main worlds created violent shifts of gravity, and had resulted in the formation of three unusual asteroid belts. Only the bravest or most foolish of ship captains could ever hope to safely navigate the gravitic nightmare of the system’s asteroids, and thus the Lords Dragon, the ancient cabal of Arch-Magi tasked with policing the Mechanicus within the Sector, took the hidden centre of these belts as their new home.

The Panopticon Orbital was built as a habitat and headquarters for the Lords Dragon, but more importantly as a hub of observation. The Lords Dragon knew that they would need to observe the emerging Calixis Sector to ensure that tech-heresy and affronts to the Machine God never went unpunished. Using scarcely understood devices from the Dark Age of Technology, the Lords Dragon established an extensive monitoring network known as the Praecursator Grid across the Pondus system, using the space around their new home as a field test. If their system allowed observation without direct interference, then they knew that they could expand the grid to cover all the forge worlds that would eventually be built, and even some worlds outside the Mechanicus’ sphere of authority.

They soon discovered that the surviving descendants of the original colonists had actually thrived in their cruel environment, and performed genetic modifications to improve their usefulness even further. Lest others such as the Ecclesiarchy claim them, the population was interred into massive Great Holds and kept in stasis in the fringes of the cometary clouds surrounding the system. When the Crusade arrived in the system many years later, it would find a group of harsh, uninhabited worlds suitable only for the Adeptus Mechanicus, and once established, the Lords Dragon could bring the population back, each one of them ready and eager to work for the glory of the Omnissiah. Such is the scope of the Lords Dragon and their guidance for the greater good of the Machine Cult.

With the success of their observation technology, the Lords Dragon began to involve themselves directly in the Angevin Crusade. They went back to their usual methods of seeking out corruption from within, ensuring that the worlds the crusade conquered were purged of tech-heresy. They took steps to ensure that the Explorator fleets found their way to what would become the Lathes System, and then did what they could to engineer the ceding of the worlds to the Mechanicum. As each new forge world was lit, the Lords Dragon monitored. Within each new voidship hull laid or Skitarii regiment raised, their surveillance kept close watch for any signs of deviant thought or deed. Hardly a moment went by when the Lords Dragon were unable to view exactly what the Mechanicus was doing within the gestating Calixis Sector, or, at least, that is what they would wish all who dwell in the Lathe Worlds to believe.

The Lords Dragon have always made the Inquisition wary. From the Inquisition’s perspective, only it has the proper remit and power to safeguard humanity against the terrors within, without, and beyond, and it does not relish the idea of others, operating outside of its purview, attempting to do the same. The Tricorn Palace has spent many fruitless years petitioning the Lathes for access to the Panopticon Orbital, but every request has been denied. To make matters worse, the Inquisition is seemingly unable to even prove its existence, though many suppose this is more than likely a ploy of intrigue for the purposes of future negotiations—if there's one thing the Inquisition excels at above all else, it is finding things.

More disturbing are the continued reports that the Praecursator Grid extends beyond the borders of the Cult Mechanicus, and that the Lords Dragon have the ability to spy upon many important Ecclesiarchical holdings, the domain of Sector Lord Hax, and the Tricorn Palace itself. Some even believe that all the cybernetics manufactured within the Calixis Sector are part of this Grid, and that everyone who has ever received a bionic is actually an unwitting spy in service to the Lords Dragon. If such a revelation were found to be true then the outrage, especially from the Ecclesiarchy and groups such as the Cult of the Pure Form, would be immense, and the Calixis
Sector could find itself in a sectarian conflict the likes of which it has never seen. The Inquisition has mounted numerous operations to infiltrate the Lords Dragon but has not met with any reported success, their agents usually returning empty-handed—often with a letter of reproachment from the Lords Dragon in hand—or, sometimes, simply not returning at all.

Yet for all their clandestine work and surprisingly adroit political manoeuvring, the Lords Dragon are more than willing to work alongside the Inquisition when the situation calls for it. Unlike most within the Calixian Mechanicus, the Lords Dragon are not especially secretive when it comes to cooperation with other organisations, as long as they can stay behind the scenes. This has given the Lords Dragon a fearful reputation amongst the Lathe populations, and they are all too eager and willing to foster this dread. They actively encourage the servants of the Mechanicus to believe the stories—that they are always watching, that they can operate in plain sight without anyone knowing, and that the fabled Dragon Secutorii are waiting for the moment when they will swoop down and destroy everyone who has ever cursed at a machine. This could be a ruse to disguise possible gaps in their observational systems or limitations of their power, creating the impression that the Lords Dragon are more omniscient than they truly are. Some even whisper that the dreaded Praecursator Grid itself does not exist at all, and never has either—the seemingly pervasive eyes and ears of the Lords Dragon, then, are actually just the result of diligent "old-fashioned" agent work. Few are willing to determine if these rumours might be correct, and only those dwelling within the Panopticon Orbital know the real truth.

To be such an agent is to act in the name of the Omnissiah and to always watch for tech-heresy in any form, no matter the source. Such deviance within the Sector often comes from the highest Magos as well as the least disciplined novice Tech-Adept, as well as from unsanctified xenos abominations that would pollute the Machine Spirit. Their extensive surveillance technologies across the Lathe Worlds are not absolute, and only through extensive travel and investigation can they properly act to ensure the preservation of the Mechanicum. Agents may have differing standards as to what constitutes tech-heresy, however, despite what appear to be rigid definitions. The cabal is remarkably united in its goals, though, for the Cult of the Machine God’s survival is of paramount importance. Only through the proper worship of the Omnissiah and his blessed technologies can humanity continue, let alone achieve the perfection of the Holy Machine. All who serve the Dragon in the Lathes know that Mankind is but one blasphemous experiment or unholy xenotech activation away from falling once again into darkness, and it is their duty to prevent this, damn the protestations of the Sector's other authorities.
### **Becoming an Agent of the Lords Dragon**
Very much like the Holy Ordos of the Inquisition, the Lords Dragon are quite cautious when it comes to whom they select as their representatives. Each carefully chosen Agent must be trustworthy and incorruptible, and they must take the secrets of the Lords Dragon to their graves. To join the Lords Dragon is to gain knowledge of one of the greatest secrets in the Calixis Sector, the Praecursator Grid, and although most Agents never see the Panopticon Orbital, all are aware of its unique ability to use this Grid to observe and gather data from every forge world across the Calixis Sector. Perhaps surprisingly, Agents of the Lord Dragon are loaned to Inquisitors on a regular basis, although the more cynical voices within the Inquisition see this apparent high level of assistance as just another example of the Lords Dragon’s desire to infiltrate all aspects of the Sector's authorities and governing bodies.

Upon becoming an Agent of the Lords Dragon, the character gains the **Rigor Mentis Trait**.

**Required Career:** Adept, Arbitrator, Assassin, or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Mechanicum Thrall:** Even Agents who are not ordained Tech-Priests benefit from the considerable resources the Lords Dragon have at their disposal. The character is considered Mechanicus Class for the purposes of determining monthly income.
**Other Requirements:** Cannot have the [Peer (Ecclesiarchy)](talents.md#peer) or [Good Reputation (Ecclesiarchy)](peer.md#good%20reputation) Talents.
#### **Trait: Rigor Mentis**
The Lords Dragon might enjoy the level of dread that they inspire within the Lathe Worlds, but even they would not risk their greatest secrets for something as trivial as a reputation. Those who find themselves selected to join the Lords Dragon’s ranks undergo significant hypnoath conditioning that makes them resistant to interrogation, specifically interrogation related to the Lords Dragon themselves or anything to do with the Panopticon Orbital. It is an unconscious form of mental defence, and even if the Agent were aware of it, he would be unable to crack it intentionally.

The Acolyte may re-roll any Interaction Test made to resist the effects of Interrogation, Charm, Deceive, or any other method that an adversary might use to gain information relating to the Lords Dragon, the Panopticon Orbital, or anything related to the Praecursator Grid.

#### **Talent: All-Seeing Eye**
At some point during his service to the Lords Dragon, an Agent will be instructed in how to gain limited access to the Praecursator Grid. To access to the Praecursator Grid, the Acolyte should make a **Hard (–20) Tech-Use Test**. If he succeeds, the Acolyte gains the most recently recorded information, usually no more than a day old. If the Acolyte gains 3 or more degrees of success, he gains complete access to the Grid on that planet, and may look through any pict feed and access any archived data. Access to the Praecursator Grid must be gained personally, and the GM has final determination on whether the Acolyte can access the Grid, as well as whether the Grid is functioning within the requested area.
#### **Talent: Metal Fatigue**
**Requirements:** Interrogation Skill
Tech-heresy is a grave matter, and one that the Mechanicus does not take lightly. Hereteks and others who would misuse the Omnissiah’s gifts are the greatest enemies of the Lords Dragon, and they have developed many ways to drive information from those they capture. One of the more insidious interrogation methods is that of Metal Fatigue, where a small bionic implant is used to slowly disintegrate the subject’s cybernetic components. This causes an excruciating pain that very few can resist, and those who do often die in agony, bereft of their bionics. The Acolyte can use Metal Fatigue by making an Opposed Tech-Use Test against the subject’s Toughness. For every Degree of Success the Acolyte gains, the subject takes 1 Damage and suffers a –10 penalty to the Interrogation Test that follows. If the subject takes Damage equal to his Toughness Bonus, he permanently loses one randomly chosen cybernetic. The subject of the interrogation must have at least one cybernetic implant for the Acolyte to use this Talent.
## **Agent of Reliquary 26**

*“Ours is not an easy task. We gather those most important relics, those symbols of the culture of Mankind. We dare the darkness and travel across the stars clinging to rumour and legend as our guide.”*

— Marcius Dans, Agent of Reliquary 26
### **Background**
Entombed more than a hundred metres beneath the Inquisition's majestic if imposing Tricorn Palace is the Grand Reliquarium, a series of vaults that are home to many artefacts and powerful relics of the Calixis Sector. In these hallowed halls rest hundreds of items of power, from crafted trinkets of the Dark Age of Technology to the blessed weapons of venerable martyrs or even saints. Each of these vaults, of which reliable sources claim there at at least one hundred, are heavily guarded, monitored, and tended to by the Custodiatrix, a small organisation of curator-assassins, each charged with the safety of the artefacts and assigned to one of the vaults. Reliquary 26 contains the relics of the Scholariate at Arms.

In addition to housing artefacts, Reliquary 26 also employs a great number of Agents, men and women who scour the Calixian worlds in search of more items of renown to add to the vaunted collection. Whether through negotiation, deception, or violence, the goal of these Agents is a simple one: ensure the safety and survival of the relics of Man. To do so, they must first identify such items of power, decide whether or not the current ownership is valid, and reclaim the item in question, by force if necessary. Often, Agents act alone or in pairs, though it is not uncommon for an entire cadre of mercenaries to be hired if an acquisition proves particularly difficult. It is rumoured that that the Scholariate at Arms once hired an entire house of assassins to reclaim a relic from the blessed armour of Saint Drusus, though the veracity of such a rumour could never be proven.

As one might expect, Agents of Reliquary 26 are very well outfitted. Although they are relatively unknown as an organisation, members often find themselves at odds with Calixian nobles, Ecclesastical prelates, Rogue Traders, and mercantile magnates—individuals who often value their possessions and do not wish to part with them simply because the Inquisition asks nicely. As a result, many Agents have at least one or two enemies in the upper echelons of Imperial society. Though the agency does attempt to reimburse the owners of the relics they acquire, it is not uncommon for them to have to pry the artefact in question from the lifeless fingers of some greedy soul that simply couldn't part with it for any amount of compensation.

Reliquary 26 works quite closely with the larger Ordos of the Inquisition. Often, Inquisitors find themselves with items of interest left over from an investigation. In exchange for the safe return of any relics or artefacts found by an Inquisitor in the course of his duties, Reliquary 26 will often return the favour by loaning out an item of great power. Many Inquisitors are quite content to employ Agents of Reliquary 26 in their Acolyte cells, profiting from the Agents' access to rare and often powerful devices while maintaining a mutually-beneficial relationship with the Custodiatrix. 
### **Becoming an Agent of Reliquary 26**
An experienced servant of Reliquary 26 is an indispensable resource to an Acolyte cell. When dealing with nobility or other well-to-do types, or in areas where ancient or xenos technology may
be encountered, an Inquisitor would be well served by requisitioning an Agent of Reliquary 26's services. Such Agents usually only serve the Inquisitor the duration of the investigation at hand. Inquisitors who must regularly navigate such treacherous situations have been known to second a trusted Acolyte to the Custodiatrix to be trained in their ways, effectively gaining a permanent "representative" to Reliquary 26's hallowed armoury. As the point of contact between the Grand Reliquarium and the often covetous owners of the sought-after artefacts, most Agents become quite adept at negotiation and tradecraft. Such skills can be invaluable to an Acolyte cell, especially in situations where a hostile acquisition could be more troublesome than normal.

**Required Career:** Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Must have acquired one item of Near Unique Availability or rarer, and turned it over to his Inquisitor or directly to the Grand Reliquarium.
**Aggrieved Parties:** Even if the character has not personally wronged them, at least one group of well-heeled individuals gravely dislikes Reliquary 26. The character gains the [Rival (Ecclesiarchy), (Nobility), or (Rogue Trader)](talents.md#rival) Talent at the GM's discretion.
**Reliquary Loan:** The Grand Reliquarium has resources that include ancient and exotic equipment that is sometimes entrusted to Acolytes serving an Inquisitor. At the beginning of each mission the character gains one valuable item determined by the GM. Unless the character receives some special dispensation, the item must be returned after the mission, with grave consequences for those who try to deprive the Reliquarium of their property. The GM should choose an item that they feel is appropriate to the Acolyte's mission.

## **Bonded Emissary**

*"My masters regret that your harvest has failed, governor, and unrest stirs your little world. Perhaps you should seek assistance from the free captains as you did three years ago when you turned down our last generous offer, and with it the protection of our friendship… no? Well, unfortunately things have grown harsher in the sub-sector of late and our price now is regrettably somewhat higher…"*

— Adept-Assayer Alisha Zhou, Emissary of the Machenko Dynasty.
### **Background**
Travel is a hazardous business, and foolish is the man or woman who steps unwary of the dangers away from the safety of their own, let alone seeks to travel the cold and merciless darkness between the stars. Such travel in some ways is an even more dangerous business for the powerful and wealthy of the Calixis Sector's elites, because, although insulated by their power and their followers from commonplace hardships, they often have many enemies and much to lose. The Imperium of Man is a grim and deadly place; the great and the powerful must always fear the assassin's hand, as well as the intrigues, plots and machinations of their rivals. It is unsurprising that many choose to remain at the centre of their domains and, when matters of import arise that do not require their personal presence, they send others out in their stead. The Bonded Emissary is just such a person. Emissaries are, by their nature, powerful individuals, no mere messenger, trade factor or errand-runner. An Emissary speaks with their master's voice and carries with them a measure of their master's authority. Such a trusted and delicate position requires much from the individual involved, as they must be above all, clever, socially adept, and strong-willed. They must also have a mastery of the facts at hand and be aware of the subtle interplay of politics, while being wary always for the manoeuvring and plotting of their master's rivals. Some Emissaries focus on the skills of the diplomat and the negotiator, while others act mainly as agents to evaluate and acquire objects, opportunities, and even people who their masters might wish to recruit. Successful Emissaries soon become recognised and valued, and win favour and power in their own right. The work of an Emissary is a high risk one, however, and those that fail their employers abjectly or cause them to lose face seldom get a second chance.

In the Calixis Sector, as in much of the Imperium, Emissaries go by numerous names and titles depending on their task and their master. The Administratum has a labyrinthine series of titles and designations, from the Quastor Maximus who sits in attendance at the Lucid Palace, to the grey ranks of reeves, delagators, potentates and the innumerable sub-consuls, consuls lesser and peripatetic that shuttle between its concerns and the other branches of the Adeptus Terra and the Commercia Houses. The great trade guilds and trans-stellar cartels, such as the Skaelen-Har Hegemony and the DeVayne Corporation, have their brokers, agents and procurators to represent them. The noble houses of Scintilla, Malfi and the other major worlds have their own heralds and nuncios, and up-and-coming scions that provide them with ambassadors and who maintain their presence at court. The various powers and domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus also largely depend on Emissaries chosen from the ranks of their tech-priests to interact with the wider Imperium, whose "petty" concerns and intrigues as they see them hold little interest for the Magos. The tech-priests themselves are largely the source of some not-unjustified fear, misunderstanding, and apprehension by others, and in order to overcome this difficulty and secure their desired outcomes, the ordered minds of the Mechanicus are liable to engage a more fleshy specialist to act for them.
### **Becoming a Bonded Emissary**
By the nature of their work an Inquisitor has need of trained killers, mind-bending psykers, and dogged investigators. Most, however, often require the more subtle services of liars and dissemblers, individuals whose perception allows them to read the susurrous ebb and flow of the interplay of a noble's court, and men and women who can detect the telltale taint of madness beneath a genial façade. Emissaries are perfect for such tasks, and an Acolyte with these skills can be confidently relied upon to act as the cornerstone of any covert investigation, often with the backing of false identities and cover provided by the Holy Ordos.

## **Cyber-mastiff Handler**

*"Augur scan indicates target is spire-bound on tertiary deck thoroughfare. Initiate attack pattern omicron-delta. Confirming kill-order. Chain-jaws active. Awaiting confirmation. Kill-order confirmed. Implement attack pattern. Happy hunting!"*

— Borus Vhalkov, Arbites Cyber-mastiff Handler
### **Background**
The heavy scraping of metallic claws, the static of heavy breathing transmitted through rough vox casters, the roar of data barks coordinating a hunt—these are the sounds of doom for criminals in hive worlds across much of the Imperium. Cyber-mastiffs are a well-known sight on any world with a strong Arbites presence. When not needed for a man-hunt, they remain within the walls of the Precinct Fortresses or in the training yards, running coordinated attack and subdual patterns with their Arbitrator master, and a specially trained Tech-Priest. When on the hunt, these plasteel beasts hound their prey, sniffing their trail using rare chemicals from the ocean of Landunder in cybernetic sense-nodes, resting only when they have their prey or are commanded to stop. At the signal from their master's unique augmetic, the beasts engage their quarry and either dispatch or disable the criminal, depending on their master's instruction. To their Arbitrator comrades the Cyber-mastiff Handler is not just a single valued ally, but often acts with the effectiveness of an entire Arbites squad.

From time to time Arbitrators are trained to command a cyber-mastiff, often for those serving away from a Precinct Fortress who need a loyal and steadfast partner and bodyguard. With the proper know-how an unaugmented human can issue orders to a cyber-mastiff, but only a Tech-Priest can truly master such a magnificent techno-beast. Cyber-mastiff Handlers are a rank of specially trained Tech-Priests subordinated to the Adeptus Arbites to care for their cyber-mastiffs, living and working in the Precinct Fortresses fortunate enough to be blessed with such a contingent. Handlers spend years with their hounds, training them to track, hunt, pin, and kill. They spend countless hours running their charges through drills and training simulations, implanting commands and attack patterns into their cogitator-augmented brains through sheer repetition and rote.

All of this training is culminated on the beasts' first actual hunt, in which the Handler takes his charges into the field to be put to the test. Giving signals directly to their built-in vox receivers, the Cyber-mastiff Handler is able to coordinate extremely complex engagements through a dizzying number of pre-programmed patterns. Using powerful auspex arrays and visual sensorium data from the beasts themselves, Handlers can control their beasts at incredible ranges, directing their attacks from kilometres away.

Many Cyber-mastiff Handlers do more than simply instruct and train their charges. Tech-Priest who become Handlers are chosen for their proficiency with appeasing and motivating machine-spirits. While the construction and imprinting of such beasts is a mystery to all save the Mechanicus Magi involved in their fabrication, it is not unknown for Handlers to perform battlefield repairs and full chassis overhauls, as well as effective modifications to the original design of the Cyber-mastiff. Although skirting the edges of tech-heresy, these modifications are often well-received and appreciated by the Handler's Arbitrator colleagues, and many are expressive of the particular needs of the Precinct Fortress the Handler is assigned to. Those who favour close-quarters combat often apply circuit-rune scribed armour plating, and rare ungents and sacred oils to grease the melee weaponry, honing the already substantial original armaments. Handlers who specialise in tracking are known to burn rare chemicals to train the Cyber-mastiffs' olfactory sensor vanes. Still others might require their charges to carry powerful remote auspex scanners for patrol work and snif-scan assignments. Indeed, it is fairly common for a Cyber-mastiff Handler to train and maintain a stable of several constructs, modified in a number of ways, so that he might be prepared for any situation his fellows in the Arbites could encounter.

The way in which a Handler's Cyber-mastiffs become valued and specialised members of his own personal retinue is not at all dissimilar to how the Acolytes of an Imperial Inquisitor form a trusted and capable cadre to be used by the Inquisitor himself. A Handler can therefore be seen to be an ideal candidate for an Inquisitorial Acolyte—the fact that their assignment to Arbitrator Precinct Fortresses makes them generally more approachable than many more insular Tech-Priests is merely an additional bonus. A Cyber-mastiff Handler can provide combat and retrieval support to an Acolyte cell, along with surveillance and security; each a service of great importance to those who serve the in the Inquisition. Of particular utility to the Inquisition, the Handler's steel hounds are generally immune to madness and fear, powerful weapons the Acolytes' enemies are apt to use against them.
### **Becoming a Cyber-mastiff Handler**
Tech-Priests chosen to become a Cyber-mastiff Handler typically show remarkable promise in technical capacity and above average sociability, as their daily labours require close coordination with a force of Arbitrators. This decision is usually made during the early stages of training and the Tech-Priest, therefore, is likely to spend brief periods among the Arbitrators who he must become
accustomed to serving alongside. The Handler-to-be spends a number of months at one of several Mechanicus holdings where cyber-mastiffs are assembled, learning the proper procedures to maintain the mechanical bodies of their future charges as well as the necessary rituals and commands to appease and direct the machine spirits housed within. Once the Handler has a firm grasp of the fundamentals of care cyber-mastiffs require they are assigned to a Precinct Fortress where they may begin to habituate with their new colleagues and take charge of the Fortress' kennels. From there, the Handler's success or failure at their position is up to how well they apply the skills they've learned and the rapport they build with the Arbites.

†*This Talent may be selected without meeting the normal prerequisites.*
#### **Talent: Pack Hunter**
By relaying sensory data from multiple cyber-mastiffs to one another, the Handler is able to combine their efforts into a single hunting party far more capable than any individual within the group. For every cyber-mastiff controlled by the Handler participating in the hunt, the Handler receives a +10 bonus to Tracking Tests. In addition, he may gain bonuses from [Heightened Senses](talents.md#heightened%20senses) Talents or applicable gear possessed by one of his controlled hounds.
#### **Talent: Pack Tactics**
Some Cyber-mastiff Handlers prefer to take a very active role in the deployment of their hounds, and are adept at working alongside them, even in the thick of battle. These front-line Handlers often fight beside their hounds as trusted and familiar allies. When ganging up on an opponent with his cyber-mastiff, a Cyber-mastiff Handler imposes a –20 penalty to all [Dodge](skills.md#dodge) or [Parry](combat.md#parry%20%28reaction%29) Tests made by his target.
## **Factor of the Lathes**

*“The subtleties of human society are often dismissed by our brothers and sisters, but these mysteries too tick in accordance with the ordered principles of the Omnissiah. Like a fine chronograph, the human mind clicks and grinds in complex patterns set out in His image. And like a cogitator or a manufactorum or a voidship, this machine must be understood—and mastered—by some Priests of our order, so that the grand Quest for Knowledge can continue.”*

— excerpt from *The Human Machine*, Factor Cottbus
### **Background**
Many members of the Adeptus Mechanicus often choose to ignore the niceties of Imperial society, cleaving instead to their own esoteric, arcane practices. However, there are those within the Martian Priesthood who understand that this is a form of conceit—even if a Tech-Priest never leaves the forge world they were ordained upon, it is more than likely he will eventually need to negotiate, wheedle, or bargain with the flesh-flapping and uncouth individuals who hold themselves highly in the Imperium, that he might further the Quest for Knowledge. As a Tech-Priest ascends in rank and influence within the Adeptus Mechanicus, it becomes increasingly difficult to shun interaction with those who live in ignorance of the Omnissiah's blessings. 

Seeing this social obstruction as a mathematical problem to be solved, forward-looking Magi of long ago devised a clever solution through the use of specialisation and applied logical thinking. After all, the Mechanicus trains their Magos Metallurgicus to refine the secrets of the true flesh, Magos Alchemys to create mystic unguents, and even Magos Biologos to unwrap the riddle of the helix. Why, then, should there not be a field of study and its attendant scholars to read the muddy and inscrutable outputs generated by outsiders and efficiently translate it into the pure, precise language of the machine? 

In the Calixis Sector, these rare tech-emissaries are known as Factors, where they function as ambassadors of the Lathe Worlds to the wider sector, charged with finding the most expedient path to collaborate with the uninitiated on their own fleshy terms. Tech-Priests that are chosen to become a Factor undergo decades of intense training and physical modification in the Hesh Protocol Academies, that they might become optimised communications and diplomatic instruments of the Omnissiah. Factors of the Lathes are capable of regurgitating vast amounts of data that most of their brethren would deem worthless or wholly below their notice. Such information ranges from a clinically thorough knowledge of the political history of the Calixis Sector to truly inscrutable subjects, such as how to properly input and cycle nutrients to maintain the expected etiquette when meeting with the hive nobles of various planets.

As an agent who spends most of his time around those who are generally unaccustomed to the ways of the Machine God and its thralls a Factor must accept that imperfection itself can be part of a perfect plan. The Omnissiah’s purity may be found in steel and circuitry, but a Factor must also be able to understand, and even appreciate, what he sees as the inferior workings of blood, bone, and tissue, for such is the constitution of those he is charged with caucusing. Fundamentally, Factors are often as heavily augmented as their brethren, but they bear few visible signs of their
metallic ascension. Their augmetics are crafted with loving precision to resemble at least the appearance of flesh, if not its warmth or tendency to bleed. This level of techno-artisanship is considered a frivolity at best by most in the Mechanicus, with some arguing that it contradicts some of the fundamental tenets of their creed. Mechadendrites are kept compact and subtle, hidden under the Factor's robes or able to collapse into specially designed concealed compartments when not in use. To maintain compatibility with larger augmetics, such as servo-arms and integrated weapons, Factors have studied the difficult and tedious art of attaching and removing such components from their cyber-mantles, allowing them to present a minimally augmented profile when required.

As they are not immediately recognisable as Priests of the Machine Cult, Factors of the Lathes often signify their office via their garb or other ornamentation. They usually wear heavily adorned Mechanicum robes, and sometimes even have shifting electoos embedded in their skin, emblazoned with the sign of the Cogwheel, visible when they wish to state their allegiance but vanishing if they need to act more covertly.

Some Factors revel in their singular positions, as it is a privilege to travel far and wide, meeting many unique humans with a level of autonomy rarely offered by the extremely structured and rigid hierarchy of the Mechanicum. Others bemoan the travails and deprivations it entails, understanding the importance of their work but sorely regretting that there wasn't another Tech-Priest more qualified than they for the job. All, however, maintain a certainty of purpose, as time and time again the civility, tact, and social guile of the Factors have been critical to achieving the Calixian Mechanicus' goals. The shrewd manoeuvring of a Factor has persuaded a planetary governor to support the purge of a brewing techno-schism, secured the assistance of a Rogue Trader dynasty whose resources saved a becalmed Explorator fleet in the Koronus Expanse, and even avoided a bloody conflict between the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Inquisition's Calixian Conclave over a fundamental disagreement of superintendence.

In the latter case, a Mechanicus Secutor cadre had threatened to annihilate an Ordo Xenos holding on the feudal world of Penolpass, where a number of Hybris radicals were committing—in the eyes of the Mechanicus—unspeakable acts of tech-heresy involving weapons and artefacts of xenos manufacture. The resultant siege escalated into a Mechanicus orbital blockade of Penolpass, but not before the radical Ordo Xenos Inquisitors had managed to issue a call for aid to their allies in the Malfian sub-sector. With the impending threat of a naval battle above Penolpass looming, a handful of Factors, secretly backed by the Lords Dragon of the Lathes, opened urgent dialogue with their Inquisitorial counterparts. The final terms of the negotiation were kept secret from all but a few within both the Mechanicus and the Inquisition, but the matter was resolved, and a destructive (not to mention politically embarrassing) shooting war was avoided at very nearly the last moment.

The decisive role played by the Factors left a favourable impression on many within the Inquisition (although perhaps not the unfortunate Hybris cohort on Penolpass). While their apparent lack of augmentation is usually used as a strictly social contrivance, putting others at ease during important negotiations, that same clandestine power enables Factors to act as absolutely superb infiltrators. The prospect of a fully-ordained Tech-Priest, whose form betrays no overt signs of its true nature, and who has sufficient social graces to interface with commoner citizens and laymen, is a singularly attractive one to many Inquisitors who value stealth and subtlety in their Acolytes. Prying a Factor free of their current assignment can be a difficult prospect, even for an Inquisitor, but reward is often worth the effort.
### **Becoming a Factor of the Lathes**
Tech-Priests chosen to become Factors train on Lathe-Hesh, where their bodies and minds are shaped so that they can fulfil the unique function for which they have been selected. This training and augmentation (or modification of existing augmetics) can take a highly variable span of time—some Factors pass through the Protocol Academy within just a few years, while others take decades to integrate the subtle etiquette sub-routines needed for proper interaction with the myriad factions of the Calixis Sector. This is to say nothing of mastering the delicate, abstruse work of what amounts to severing and re-attaching their own augmetic body parts purely for the sake of appearances.

Upon becoming a Factor of the Lathes, the character gains the **Fabricated Flesh Trait**.

**Required Career:** Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (0 xp) 
**Other Requirements:** Fellowship 20. This Alternate Career Rank should be selected during character creation, as the process of becoming a Factor of the Lathes could take more than a few years to complete.
**Personable Protocol:** Factors of the Lathes undergo a heavy regimen of training at the Protocol Academy, learning much in the ways of etiquette, diplomacy, negotiation, and other social skills to improve their abilities as ambassadors of the Mechanicus. They also receive more esoteric gifts of the Omnissiah to aid their efforts in communication, such as pheromone inducer implants and engrammed rhetorical procedures. Upon becoming a Factor of the Lathes the cumulative effects of this training changes the Tech-Priest's Characteristic Advances as follows:

| **Characteristic** | **Simple** | **Intermediate** | **Trained** | **Expert** |
| ------------------ | :--------: | :--------------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| Weapon Skill       |    250     |       500        |     750     |   1,000    |

#### **Trait: Fabricated Flesh**
A Factor of the Lathes bears few of the usual marks of being a Tech-Priest; his cyber-mantle is fully hidden by false flesh or even vat-grown skin, and any augmetics or bionic limbs that he possesses appear to be a part of his body, easily concealed under clothing and, if revealed, appearing no more distinctive than common augmetics many Imperial citizens possess.

The Tech-Priest retains all of the benefits of the [Mechanicus Implants Trait](tech-priest.md#Tech-Priest%20Abilities%20In%20Game%20Terms), but it requires a [Hard (–20) Scrutiny](skills.md#scrutiny) or [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Test to notice any significantly off-putting signs of his mechanical parts that mark him as a Tech-Priest. If he possesses mechadendrites or other large attachments that would obviously set him aside as a member of the Adeptus Mechanicus, he may attach or remove any number of them at will. This ritual takes 1d5 hours to complete and causes the Factor to gain 1 level of Fatigue from the mental stress and discomfort, but has no other deleterious effects. So long as his augmentations are not distractingly noticeable to those he is interacting with, a Factor of the Lathes gains a +5 bonus to all Fellowship-based Tests when dealing with Imperial citizens outside of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

— Genetor Aurelius Thoze, Adeptus Mechanicus Xenobiologist
### **Background**
Genetors are scholars into matters genetic and biological, a field of study that makes them quite distinct from the majority of Tech-Priests, their professional obsession with organic life often making them seem strange to their more mechanically-inclined brethren. 

For the most part, Genetors differ little from other Tech-Priests—they bear the same manner of implants, venerate information and understanding as the manifestation of divinity, and engage upon the Quest for Knowledge in much the same way. The grand difference between Genetors and any of the other sects of the Mechanicus is that they are not so quick to judge flesh and blood as inferior to steel. Indeed, Genetors see no hypocrisy or incongruence with this view, as in the most abstract sense living creatures are merely extremely complex and adaptable machines themselves. Where some are content to make this observation distantly, others embrace it, seeking to improve their forms not with steel, but with better flesh and better blood. To an unknowing observer, a Genetor may appear little different to any other Tech-Priest when swathed in their robes. However, where most Tech-Priests’ mass is derived from steel reinforcement and implanted armour plate, a Genetor may have augmented himself with vat-muscle, toughened skin, organic-reinforced bones, and possibly even strange anatomy more commonly seen on great and terrible beasts then men.

The Genetor's mastery of the mysteries of flesh, bone, and bodily humours makes them natural medicae, able to diagnose strange ailments and treat all matters of disease and injury. Any Imperial Hospice, Collegia Medicae, or other institution of healing would be blessed to have a Genetor in residency, for their well-paying patients can rest assured that virtually any sickness or frailty of the flesh is not beyond such a knowledgeable soul's means to mend. An unusually large number of Genetors have settled on Fenksworld, far to the coreward side of the Josian Reach, and the planetary capital of Nova Castilla hosts some of the finest houses of fleshcrafting in the entire sector. For the powerful and well-heeled of Calixis, "a trip to Fenksworld" has become an expression for any travel made for reasons of health, for as long as the Thrones are available, one could very nearly purchase a brand-new body there.

Genetors' interest in the organic is not merely limited to their own forms, or even to that of humans. A subsect of Genetors known as Xenobiologists focus their study of alien genetics, to understand the mysteries of how they function (ostensibly so as to slay them the better, of course). Such knowledge is dangerous, and Genetors whose praise of alien physiology in terms that go beyond the academic have been condemned as heretics for claiming, or at least implying, the superiority of xenos over humans. Regardless of their controversial views, the presence of a
Genetor, particularly a Xenobiologist, is seen as an asset by Explorator fleets and Rogue Traders alike, as their knowledge of human and inhuman forms allows them to discern the nature of a newly-encountered xenos or indigenous species, or categorise a new strain of abhuman found on a far-flung world.

Within the Calixis Sector, Genetors have a particularly illustrious history—Xenobiologists in great numbers joined with the Angevin Crusade to study the aliens native to the Calyx Expanse as their realms were shattered by the forces of the Imperium. Since that time, they have remained a noteworthy, if often overlooked, element of Cult Mechanicus politics within the Lathes and beyond, and they gather in significant numbers to join expeditions into the Koronus Expanse,
seeking to be the first to encounter new life to dissect and analyse.

Three distinct philosophies exist amongst the Calixian Genetors. The first and oldest is the Primus Humanum, which espouses the purity of the human form, viewing the body of the God-Emperor as that of the ideal human and therefore the perfect vessel for knowledge. Genetors who ply their trade as chirurgeons and juvenant specialists, healing the sick and broken and restoring vitality to the aged, most often align with this sect. The second, and presently most dominant amongst the Genetors of the Lathes, are collectively known as Apexists, believing that adversity breeds strength in the organic, and that the perfect organism is the one that has overcome every rival and every challenge; the philosophy itself is an adaptation of the writings of an ancient pre-Imperial scholar. The third philosophy, currently gaining favour amongst more widely-travelled Genetors, and causing concern for their more conservative peers, is espoused by a tech-cult known as the Companions of Vogel. Recently, their founder, Magos-Explotrator Heydrich Vogel, returned from a century-long expedition into the Koronus Expanse and began preaching a creed of forced genetic and biological augmentation. This radical notion, Vogel argues, is needed in order to strengthen the teeming masses of humanity for the troubles he believes are ahead. Vogel's detractors believe this ideology verges upon heresy, and its suggestion that humanity is somehow insufficient in its current state is seen by many as a blasphemy in its own right.
### **Becoming a Genetor**
The difference between a Genetor and most other Tech-Priests is one of training, aptitude, and focus. As is so frequently the case in the Adeptus Mechanicus, understanding begets power, which in turn begets knowledge, and only those who possess the will and the wit to understand that knowledge can properly obtain any form of status amongst their kind. A particular and unusual disposition is required to become a Genetor: the tendency to view organic life as a form of machine in its own right, the shape of the Omnissiah rendered in just another format, rather than as a weak fleshy shell to be discarded as many Tech-Priests tend to view it as.

A Genetor, especially if they happen to consider themselves a Xenobiologist, would be an ideal Acolyte for an Inquisitor of the Ordo Xenos. As that Ordo's line of work inevitably takes them into confluence (and usually conflict) with all matters of aliens and other strange creatures, a certifiable expert in alien biology joining the Inquisitor's retinue would be a priceless boon. Inquisitors of other Ordos could still appreciate a Genetor's many talents, of course—not the least of which being their unparalleled ability to heal and restore the broken bodies of their fellow Acolytes.

**Required Career:** Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Toughness 35, Intelligence 40. Upon reaching Rank 6 you must select the Technomancer path.

#### **Talent: A Machine of Flesh**
**Talent Groups:** Brute, Clawed/Fanged, Feels No Pain, Multiple Arms, Nightsider, Regeneration, Sonar Sense, Sturdy, Tough Hide, Venomous, Winged
Flesh is not a weakness as far as you are concerned, but rather a font of untapped potential. Locked within your genes and your tissues are the secrets to greater power, and though you do not eschew the strength of steel nor your existing implants, you see them only as part of the mechanism by which you can better yourself. With absolute mastery over the biologics of your own body, the living flesh becomes clay to be moulded into almost any shape you desire. You brew genetically activated serums to induce controlled mutation and craft new limbs and organs out of their basic biological components before grafting them to your body, granting you power and abilities that even your purist colleagues in the Mechanicus must admit (often begrudingly) are true works of the fleshcrafter's art.

Each time you select this Talent choose one of the Mutations or Traits listed under the Talent Groups heading. You gain that Trait or the effects of the Mutation. Although some of these Talent Groups are chosen from the Mutations Table, whether or not you are genuinely a mutant is a matter of debate.
## **Heretek Savant**

*“++No Secutor, you may not move++ Even now conduction filaments are piercing your neural systems and unworthy flesh++ So they sent you to find me, did they?++ To carry out the Omnissiah’s judgment on me?++ Well you found me—or more accurately I found you, foolish puppet of meat and iron++ Now you will dance on my strings, not theirs++ Ah yes, your last paltry defences fall++ In a way I envy you; in a moment you will experience the most exquisite of agonies as I rip apart and overwrite your synapses one-by-one, it should be quite the experience++ Now Secutor, open wide, here… I… am.”*

— cognitive data-chain forensically recovered from Secutor Rho–456-0, aftermath of the destruction of Forge-Control Lathe-Het Delta-9
### **Background**
The strictures and dictates of the Adeptus Mechanicus are many and harsh; they form a labyrinthine and iron-clad code that defines every aspect of the lives of the Omnissiah’s priesthood, their outlook and practices. Their purpose is as simple as it is unwavering: to control and regulate knowledge and its use, stifle innovation, and above all maintain the Machine Cult’s stranglehold on the Imperium’s technology. To become a Heretek Savant by that phrase’s purest definition is to abandon this code, at least in the Tech-Priest’s private thoughts. It is to embrace individual innovation, experimentation, and free will, straying from the path ordained by the teachings of the Archmagos Doctrinal. For a Tech-Priest to do so is every bit as rare, as radical, and heretical as a Confessor of the Adeptus Ministorum straying away from the Imperial Creed, and the consequences for those that do stray, should their aberrant behaviour be discovered, is every bit as harsh. Although, while a deviant Confessor should expect to face a pyre, Heretek Savants can look forward to having their implants ripped bodily from them while alive and whatever meat that remains useful recycled into servitor components to pay for their sins.

Heretek Savants can come to their renegade position for a variety of reasons, the most common of which are to do with the simple exercising of their free will away from the structured environments of the Machine God’s domains. Such tech-heresy is particularly prevalent among those Tech-Priests who serve in Explorator fleets or who have found their way into the Inquisition’s service. The consequences of self-reliance and forced adaptation in the field away from help can affirm the Omnissian faith for some Tech-Priests, but for others it can lead them increasingly to question and to innovate in order to overcome adversity and seek their own answers. Others come to tech-heresy for darker reasons, such as personal ambition and the obsessive quest for power and knowledge which will allow them no respite and lead them to increasingly rail against the narrow confines of the Cult Mechanicus’ approved technologies and patterns. Regardless, the path of tech-heresy is a dangerous one and as perilous in its way as tampering with the powers of the warp. Exposure to the artefacts and lore of the alien and the sins of humanity’s ancient past can be every bit as corrupting, both for the body and soul.

Secrecy is as vital for Heretek Savants as for any other whose knowledge and actions would condemn them in the eyes of the Imperium, for discovery will lead to sanction and destruction by the power of the Cult Mechanicus. This usually leads to a slow distancing of themselves from their fellows in the Mechanicus and a deep-seated paranoia of discovery. As a result Heretek Savants rapidly gain a merciless and suspicious streak centred on their own self-preservation, increasingly favour implanting (often heretical) weaponry and defensive systems into their own bodies, and will stop at nothing in the service of the quest for knowledge.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Heretek Savants are an extremely diverse lot, though few would ever consider their actions as anything that could be considered heretical. For many, it is not a matter of ideology or organised resistance to the Mechanicus—the Tech-Priest has simply judged that they know better than thousands of years of Martian orthodoxy, and no longer feels constrained to its strictures. Others do couch their views as an explicit philosophy that stands in opposition to the mainline of the Mechanicus, such as the Omnissiads and Logicians, who practice their own interpretation of the Machine Cult in secret to avoid persecution. Notably, while orthodox Tech-Priests see only semantic distinction between them, Heretek Savants do not count the so-called Dark Mechanicus as cohorts. These thoroughly deranged renegades, long allied with the Ruinous Powers of Chaos, are well known for profaning their machines with daemonic entities and other warp-spawned horrors. Though Heretek Savants might have strayed, in some cases quite far, from the established teachings of the Mechanicus, nearly all understand that corrupting a machine spirit with something dragged forth from the immaterium is a truly irredeemable act.
### **Becoming a Heretek Savant**
A matter of choice and opportunity rather than induction into a secret cult or service to a master, all that is needed is for a Tech-Priest to become a Heretek Savant is to turn his back on the sacred doctrines of the Cult Mechanicus in order to substitute his own guiding principles. These may be personal ambition, distaste for perceived injustices or failings on the part of the orthodox Mechanicum, or simply a desire to pair the Quest for Knowledge with entirely new ways of thinking. From this point on, they risk censure and destruction by their former peers if their heresies are discovered, and are forever more false of heart and must remain eternally vigilant.

The Inquisition's take on the Heretek Savant can be extremely varied. Some, especially the more puritanical Inquisitors, or those who were once members of the Mechanicus themselves, view them as no different than any other heretic worthy of righteous purgation, and will persecute any they come across. Others can be surprisingly tolerant, and occasionally even supportive. The particular reasons for this are just as diverse as the Inquisitors themselves. More than a few Inquisitors have a sceptical, if not outright distrustful, view of the Adeptus Mechanicus and its secretive and insular ways. Assuming the Heretek Savant is not guilty of any other misdeeds beyond rejecting Mechanicus orthodoxy, such an Inquisitor might be quite keen to accept one into their retinue. Others, particularly members of the Inquisition's radical faction, might chafe against the Mechanicum's rigid and dogmatic protection of the secrets of technology—mysteries that, in the Inquisitor's view, should surely be known to the Holy Ordos too. For an Inquisitor with little concern over the commission of tech-heresy, a capable Heretek Savant could be a valuable source of new and innovative mechanical devices, no matter how loudly the Mechanicus would protest such a consideration.

Upon becoming a Heretek Savant, the character gains the **Excommunicate Mechanicum Trait**.

**Required Career:** Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Willpower 35, at least one [Forbidden Lore](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) Skill.
**System Corrupted:** Breaking from the engrammatically reinforced strictures and cortical routines of obedience to the Omnissiah’s dictates is a profoundly disturbing experience, and this revelatory shock inflicts 1d5 Insanity Points on the Tech-Priest when this Alternate Career Rank is taken.
#### **Trait: Excommunicate Mechanicum**
Orthodox members of the Adeptus Mechanicus are distrustful in the extreme of any that would shun the purity of the Omnissian dictates. Should any member of the Machine Cult learn of the Acolyte’s heretek activities, there could be dire consequences. If discovered, treat any member of the Mechanicus as having the lowest possible Disposition towards the character. Additionally, all forms of Interaction—even just speaking with members of the Machine Cult—are to be treated as **Arduous (–40)** before factoring in other modifiers.

Certain elements of the Mechanicus, such as the tech-heresy hunting Magos Juris, or agents of the Lords Dragon of the Lathes, are more than likely to respond to a Heretek Savant with violence. This could be either immediately upon detection, or at a later date once more investigation is complete and a suitably horrific punishment has been planned.

#### **Heretek Savant Talents**

##### Aetheric Resonator
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

You can use the energy stored in your Potentia Coil to power a hidden lattice of techno-arcane circuitry wards which create a resonant aetheric disruption field that can bar the passage of the warp energies and blunt psychic force directed against you—but not without risk of dangerous feedback contamination. The field is triggered by passing a **Difficult (–10) Toughness Test** and can be kept active for a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus before it must re-activated again. If the Test is failed, you gain one level of Fatigue; if it is passed, the field is successfully charged and your body and any Armour worn counts as being Hexagramatically Warded. At the end of every Round the Resonator is active roll 1d10; on a roll of a ‘9’ you suffer 1d5 Corruption Points from the twisting energies of the warp bleeding into your body and mind.
##### Anima Aura
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Potentia Coil)

You have integrated the forbidden principles of the vile Sarcosan Wave Generator into your augmetic systems, allowing you to generate a field of energy that can keep what remains of your flesh animate even after it has been damaged or necrotised. By spending a Half Action you may activate the Anima Aura. The aura last for a number of Rounds equal 1d10 plus your Toughness Bonus. For as long as the Anima Aura is active, you have [The Stuff of Nightmares](traits.md#the%20stuff%20of%20nightmares) Trait. While active, the aura also creates discordant moaning like the keening of damned souls. Each time you use this Talent you must Test Willpower, with failure causing you to gain 1d5 Insanity Points.
##### Luminen Desecration
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electoo Inductor/Potentia Coil)

Your implants generate a violent techsorcism pulse, allowing you to disable technology in your presence. A single gesture and most sophisticated devices simply cease to function. A successful Ballistic Skill Test allows you to direct the energy against a single target within 10 metres. This is a ranged attack and can be Dodged, but is not blocked by fields or other protective devices. If the target is carrying any electrically-motivated devices or gear—including energy weapons and augmetics—they cease to operate for 1d5 Rounds, as if their power had run out.

If the target is a vehicle, it immediately suffers a Critical Hit as if you had scored Righteous Fury, but subtracting one from the Critical Hit result. If this reduces the result to zero there is no effect.
##### Nightmare Field
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cranial Circuitry/Potentia Coil)

You have integrated utterly proscribed devices into your Cranial Circuitry and Potentia Coil. These dread augmentations allow you to produce a mixture of subharmonic and electromagnetic
interference patterns that generate a primal terror in anyone nearby, which you may taste and tune through your Cranial Circuitry. By spending a Half Action you may produce an effect identical to the [Terrify Psychic Power](telepathy.md#terrify), although as this is ability is not actually psychic in nature, it requires no Power Roll and you cannot cause Psychic Phenomena. When the field is activated it makes a noise like an unearthly shrieking that is both physically painful and deeply unsettling to all who hear it, even those who are outside the effect's range.

You may choose to activate Nightmare Field at the same time as the Rite of Fear, should you possess that Talent, to amplify the effects of both. You are considered to have a Fear Rating of 2 while the Rite of Fear is active, and all targets affected by the Nightmare Field add +20 to their roll on the Shock Table.
##### The Power Beyond

Your unsanctioned tests on warp-corrupted devices and the gear of Chaos worshippers lead you to believe that even the might of the Dark Gods can be overcome by the purity of the machine, and even devices tainted by the ravages of the immaterium are not beyond salvation. You can use all daemonic weapons and wargear, as well as any equipment deemed “corrupted” by the power of the warp, with only a –10 penalty to their operation, take all [Fear Tests](fear%20and%20damnation.md#degrees%20of%20fear) caused by daemons at one level lower (Fear (2) becomes Fear (1), Fear (1) is ignored, and so on), and once per session may automatically pass a [Forbidden Lore (Daemonology)](skills.md#forbidden lore) or [Scholastic Lore (Occult) Test](skills.md#scholastic%20lore) with degrees of success equal to your Intelligence Bonus.
##### The Power Within

Your dangerous experiments with captured psykers lead you to believe that either true progress can be made by looking inwards to the emerging psychic race that is humanity, or alternatively, that there is a technological means to stop the psychic downfall of Mankind, whichever more closely aligns with your beliefs. You are treated as having the [Resistance (Psychic Powers)](talents.md#resistance) Talent, take all [Fear Tests](fear%20and%20damnation.md#degrees%20of%20fear) caused by Psychic Powers at one level lower (Fear (2) becomes Fear (1), Fear (1) is ignored, and so on), and once per session may automatically pass a [Forbidden Lore (Psykers)](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) or [Forbidden Lore (Warp)](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) Test with degrees of success equal to your Intelligence Bonus.
##### The Power Without

Your iconoclastic work with Cold Trade prizes lead you to believe that the lack of true divinity is what makes xenos technology so inferior to those of the Machine God, but just the same there's no true sin in using them to vanquish the alien's foul presence from the Omnissiah's sight. You can use all xenos weapons and wargear with only a –10 penalty to their operation, take all [Fear Tests](fear%20and%20damnation.md#degrees%20of%20fear) caused by xenos at one level lower (Fear (2) becomes Fear (1), Fear (1) is ignored, and so on), and once per session may automatically pass a [Forbidden Lore (Archeotech)](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) or [Forbidden Lore (Xenos)](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) Test with degrees of success equal to your Intelligence Bonus.
## **Myrmidon**

*"Nothing, and no one, escapes the judgement of the Lords Dragon. The Universal Laws are absolute, therefore so are we absolute."*

— Magos Militant Corsiva prior to the annihilation of House Caloclast
### **Background**
Although all initiates of the Machine God are versed to some extent in conflict and the skills of warfare, certain Mechanicus sects and military formations exist to study the art of destruction with the ardent fervour that their fellows might apply to the creation of machinery or the recovering of lost technoarcana. Chief among these in the Calixis Sector are the forces of the Auxilia Myrmidon, also known by some as the siege engineers or war-savants. The first hosts of the Auxilia Myrmidon arrived in the Calyx Expanse at the head of the Mechanicus commitments during the early days of the Angevin Crusade, and have since remained to defend Mechanicum possessions there. Myrmidons are expert killers, masters of battlefield control and siege warfare. At the behest of the ruling Archmagos of the Forge Worlds, they are sent to accompany Explorator fleets in investigating finds in the most dangerous regions of space and retrieve the most hazardous xenos-specimens, while others are tasked to hunt down renegades accused of the foulest tech-heresies and terminate them with extreme prejudice.

Tech-Priests who show a natural aptitude for battle or devote themselves to studying weaponry and the art of warfare are commonly sought out by the Myrmidons, receiving further militant augmetics and access to ancient, rare, and terrifying weapons to hone their destructive potential to even greater levels. The most common initiates of the Myrmidons, known as Secutors, are the "public face" of the host, and those not intimately familiar with the inner workings of the Mechanicus are likely to refer to any Myrmidon—even a Magos Militant—as a Secutor if not corrected. It is believed that this title was once used by warriors of supreme ability on ancient pre-Imperial Terra, a testament to the Myrmidons' combat prowess, as well as the age and wealth of secrets the Mechanicus sits upon.

The main host of the Auxilia Myrmidon is based at The Lathes, in particular a heavily fortified arsenal on the city-sized Panopticon orbital station. From this mustering ground Myrmidon hosts are dispatched, usually in small bands, to oversee the defences of Mechanicus holdings, join military endeavours considered to be of import to Mechanicus interests, and to seek out and destroy those the Mechanicus deems to be their enemies. The Myrmidons are mostly independent and autonomous within the greater structure of the Mechanicus, answering only to the Archmagi of The Lathes and the secretive cabal of the Lords Dragon. The latter have a dread reputation of absolute will and reach, carried out by innumerable agents, informants, and spies, but it is the Myrmidons that guarantee their authority over matters of the Machine Cult in Calixis.

Towering figures of steel shrouded in blood-red robes, bearing all matters of combat augmetics and wielding heavy weaponry of arcane manufacture, the Myrmidons are war makers whose knowledge of the arts of siege craft, weaponry, and devastation is without peer. Although relatively few in number, they are baleful opponents to face in battle, with the mightiest of their number able to absorb damage and send it back out at a rate that would even give a Space Marine of the Adeptus Astartes pause. With some resembling a walking arsenal more than anything else, Myrmidons are held in no little fear and awe by other members of the Machine Cult, as their presence all but guarantees that violence is likely imminent.

Aside from their raw combat power, which is already enormous, Myrmidon hosts that specialise in persecuting tech-heresy will often deploy incredibly rare intrusion spirits and binaric subjugation routines, effectively turning the weapons and servants of hereteks against them. Such instruments are borderline heresy in their own right, and would only ever be deployed by those with explicit remit from the highest Archmagi. The obvious applications in combat force multiplier and security breaching notwithstanding, it is also a very firm statement that true mastery of the machine belongs to those who serve the Lords Dragon, no matter what the rebellious and deviant hereteks might deign to believe.
### **Becoming a Myrmidon**
Some Tech-Priests are drawn to the path of the Secutor and the Magos Militant through a fascination with the unique and intellectual challenges warfare provides, while others feel themselves fixated upon the intricacies and beauties of creation and destruction, or the sacred art of weaponsmithing. Others simply see this path as a means to an end, either for the protection of the Machine Cult, the furtherance of their own independent researches, or as an act of religious devotion to the Omnissiah as Destruction Itself, or in the manner of the Ordo Reductor, the Unmaker God. For a few with a special hatred of tech-heresy, joining the Auxilia Myrmidon is simply one of the most expedient paths to crush hereteks.

Regardless of their vocation, a Tech-Priest skilled in such destructive arts as a Myrmidon is an invaluable ally for militant Inquisitors, and they make for singularly lethal Acolytes. A matter of question for such an association, however, is the close relationship between the Myrmidon Auxilia and the highest levels of power within the Calixian Mechanicus. Even more so than most Tech-Priests, an Inquisitor could never be fully sure of where a Myrmidon's loyalties lie, or what ancient and dark secrets of the Machine Cult they may themselves possess.

**Required Career:** Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Weapon Skill 35, Ballistic Skill 35, Willpower 35, at least four Weapon Training Talents.

#### **Talent: Subversive Programming**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cranial Circuitry/Potentia Coil)
You have received a binary argot that confuses and subverts the programming of servitors and other machine creatures, allowing you to direct their actions. As a Half Action, you may attempt to command a creature with the [Machine](traits.md#machine%20%28X%29) Trait and an Intelligence of 20 or less. Make a Tech-Use Test opposed by the target's Willpower. If you succeed, the creature must follow your commands for the following Round. You may continue to maintain control by spending a Half Action in subsequent Rounds. If you choose to do this, you must make another opposed Test after four Rounds to maintain the link. The commands must be simple and achievable in one Round. Some examples include “Flee,” “Fall,” and “Attack the closest target.”
#### **Talent: Vile Intrusion**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Electro-Graft/Potentia Coil), Electro Graft Use
You are skilled at gaining access to the knowledge of the most sophisticated machine spirits, assailing them with scrap-code and malicious spirits provided by the Lords Dragon, until they break under the strain. This horrific act of violence against the machine is not undertaken lightly, and only ever to be employed against the worst of enemies of the Mechanicus. You gain a +20 bonus on all [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) and [Security](skills.md#security) Tests made to gain unauthorised access to an electronic or logis-controlled system, such as a cogitator or an electronic lock, so long as you can connect directly to it using your implants.
## **Ordo Sicarius Initiate**

*"Some may be able to avoid the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites. Fewer may be able to face off against the Imperial Guard, and perhaps even the Adeptus Astartes. None can stand against the Officio Assassinorum."*

— Tarik Ziz, Callidus Director Secundus
### **Background**
At the end of the Age of Apostasy and Goge Vandire’s despotic rule came a shadow conflict few have heard of and many participants did not survive: the Wars of Vindication within the Officio Assassinorum. The Officio had become riddled with corruption, and the Grand Master of Assassins was forced to kill many of its members in order to fully eliminate those still loyal to the deposed High Lord or who had fallen into irredeemable degeneracy during his rule. The Officio’s hierarchy was utterly shattered and needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, and for a time there was some discussion amongst the new High Lords that the Officio itself might be dissolved. 

As fellows of clandestine warfare, the Inquisition came to the Officio Assassinorum's aid during this moment of great peril. Following a thorough investigation and taking of accounts, Inquisitor Jaeger of the Ordo Hereticus deemed that a special order of the Inquisition would be created to help rebuild the Officio, and subsequently monitor and control some of its functions much more
closely than had occurred before. His proposal was accepted, and the Ordo Sicarius was created, with Jeager as its first Lord Inquisitor. As the Officio Assassinorum is a highly secretive branch of the Imperial hierarchy, Jeager and his henchmen understood that maintaining a typical hierarchy of control was out of the question. To preserve the Officio's ability to rive seamlessly through Imperial society the Ordo Sicarius would not maintain any formal structures outside it, instead fulfilling their duty by planting Assassin-Acolytes and, indeed, a few Inquisitors within their ranks. 

The masters of the Assassinorum know of the existence of these Ordo Sicarius agents, but not their number, postings, or individual identities. The Assassinorum and Sicarius follow an informal set of guidelines toward their unusual arrangement. Officially, the Officio Assassinorum does not attempt to expose or identify Sicarius agents, but those who are identified are marked and reported as such to their masters, who will withdraw and reassign the "made" agent. In return, if a Sicarius agent does uncover heresy or some dire conspiracy within the Assassinorum, the Ordo Sicarius will work in cooperation with the rest of the Officio to excise the malignant element with an absolute minimum disruption to their operations. Once a Sicarius agent is "made", his time secreted within the Officio Assassinorum is over, but the Inquisition has a great many other tasks that an expert at deception and guile could turn their hands to.

One notable example of the Ordo Sicarius' work dates from the early years of the 39th Millennium. Praetor Golgenna Angevin, a well-connected noble of the Terran Court, was raised to the rank of Lord Militant and granted a writ to prosecute a crusade to liberate and return the worlds of the Calyx Expanse to the Imperial fold. Among a cadre of Angevin's trusted counsellors and chamberlains was a man by the name of Dario Vereschagin. Unknown to Angevin or any of the others at the time, this servant was in actuality one Inquisitor Treyus Godan of the Ordo Sicarius. Inquisitor Godan's purpose was to monitor Angevin's crusade and to determine, on behalf of the Inquisition, whether or not such a singularly powerful individual was still loyal to the Imperium and faithfully executing the duties he was charged with. If he was not, then it was Godan's duty to eliminate him before Angevin turned the vast forces of the Crusade towards his own ends. A number of members of the Inquisition were openly serving in the forces of the Crusade, and could ostensibly fulfil the same purpose as Godan, but if the Lord Militant did betray the Imperium these badge-wearing agents and Inquisitors could conceivably be eliminated, or worse, co-opted. Godan, then, could serve as an additional measure to guarantee Angevin's loyalty. 

As the Crusade entered its third and final stage, Godan personally witnessed Angevin's acclaimed General Drusus slain by a rogue assassin. When Drusus rose from the dead, Godan was one of the first of the Crusade's leaders to recognise him as a living saint, a sure sign that the God-Emperor had blessed the Crusade's success with His divinity. Capitalising on this moment, Godan "revealed" himself as an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and officially (albeit without any sort of formal authorisation) declared the Inquisition's support of the new living saint. Reinvigorated by this moment of holy righteousness (and significant resources diverted by Inquisitorial forces) the Crusade barrelled ahead with newfound vigour, and most of the remaining worlds of Calyx were returned to the God-Emperor's light not long thereafter. Critically, by making the resurrection of Drusus a matter of Inquisitorial import, the conspirators who had him assassinated were outed, and the possibility of a religious schism over whether Drusus was truly a living saint or not was quickly put to rest before it could threaten the Crusade's revitalised momentum.

Godan, for his part, was censured for impersonating an Inquisitor, but received clemency in light of the undeniable results of his duplicity, and disappeared from the record shortly thereafter. Only a few within the Inquisition ever knew Godan was a member of the Ordo Sicarius, much less had been clandestinely monitoring the Crusade's progress and guiding the hands of its leaders the entire time. To this day, even many within the Holy Ordos are only vaguely aware of the existence of the Sicarius in the first place, but few would doubt their capability at deception and the crafting of cover identities for deep infiltration. Inquisitors whose work entails delicate and surreptitious investigation are often pleased to have an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius in their service, although some might give pause to the notion that the Sicarius-trained Acolyte could be keeping tabs on them at the same time...
### **Becoming an Ordo Sicarius Initiate**
Becoming an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius is no simple feat. The Acolyte in question must be both a skilled warrior and very capable at subterfuge. The vast majority of its members were chosen for induction by Assassin-Inquisitors of the Ordo Sicarius itself, the prospective initiates merely given a dataslate with the name of a target, and a stated goal of "Interrogation and Extermination required" written underneath. How, or even if, the prospect goes about this mission is his decision. Assuming the assignment is successfully completed, and the work is judged to be adequate, the prospect is clandestinely taken to the Ordo Sicarius' main temple and begins his training in the ways of the Assassin-Inquisitors.

#### **Talent: Sicarius Training**
The time an Acolyte spends among the most ruthless and efficient agents of stealth, deception, and murder can manifest itself in all matters of ways. Acolytes who study with agents of the Callidus Temple learn the ways of deep infiltration and flawless disguise, whilst those who spend their time among the Vindicare become highly proficient lurkers and shadesmen who can slip through security like water through a sieve. Each time you purchase this Talent select one of the following benefits:

* **Arms Aficionado:** At some point you developed a particular interest in an unusual weapon, and the Ordo Sicarius has had you study with a master of that device to further your deadly ambitions. You gain an [Exotic Weapon Training](talents.md#exotic%20weapon%20training) Talent of your choice.
* **Blackjack:** Months of working alongside the most resolute killers in Calixis has taught you how to unnerve even the most hardened adversaries with your baleful presence alone. You gain the [Disturbing Voice](talents.md#disturbing%20voice) Talent.
* **Blade Dancer:** Many Assassins are inclined to take their quarry up close, preferring the tactile certainty of the sword and dagger over a gun or bomb. You've come to see their way of thinking. You gain your choice of either the [Sure Strike](talents.md#sure%20strike) or [Swift Attack](talents.md#swift%20attack) Talent.
* **Demanding Tutelage:** Your training has ruthlessly tested the limitations of what your body can endure, but your masters were thoughtful and wise enough to only bring you the edge of what you can recuperate from. You gain the [Sound Constitution](talents.md#sound%20constitution) Talent.
* **Logical Liar:** You have memorised a staggering number of reasonable responses to common inquiries and can craft rationally believable falsehoods on-the-fly. You may substitute your Intelligence Characteristic in place of Fellowship when making Deceive Tests.
* **Part of the Scenery:** Your tutors have taught you to remain motionless for hours and possibly even days on end, your exact position monitored by unblinking servitors for even the slightest twitch. You gain the [Talented (Concealment)](talents.md#talented) Talent. If you already possess this Talent, its bonus increases to +15 instead of the usual +10.
* **Thought Mapping:** Infiltrator-savants of the Sicarius have taught you the science of predicting lines of questioning, and through logistaristic formulae you can often predict the path of a conversation well ahead of those you're speaking with. You may substitute your Intelligence Characteristic in place of Fellowship when making Inquiry Tests.
* **Well Connected:** A myriad of false identities, pulled strings, and brazen yet surprisingly convincing lies has created a persona with contacts in a useful organisation or social group. You gain a [Peer](talents.md#peer) Talent of your choice.
* **Wraith:** You have spent countless hours tracking masters of the art of stealth, honing an ability to think ahead and predict your prey's clandestine movements. You gain the [Talented (Shadowing)](talents.md#talented) Talent. If you already possess this Talent, its bonus increases to +15 instead of the usual +10.

Note that if a benefit of this Talent grants you another Talent you must still be able to meet the prerequisites, if any, for that Talent in order to accept it.
## **Slate-Agent**

*"And who am I to be this year, hmm? A wealthy functionary in a dubious merchant guild? No? Hmm, perhaps a pampered Ecclesiastic keeping watch for detestable heresy within a suspect sect? Still no, eh? Well then, can I spend the majority of this mission indoors at least? Another Imperial Guard unit? How do heretics keep managing to sneak into those! Well at least I won't remember any of it after retrieval..."*

— a Slate-Agent, currently named Cavel Posdanik
### **Background**
On the planet of Malfi, a place often considered the "second capital" of the Calixis Sector, the men and women of the ruling class play a vicious game of politics and favour. This game is played not on any game-board, but in every palace, mansion, and villa. It is not played with pieces, but with the livelihood of their dynasties. The strategy of this game lies with political manoeuvring and favourable alliances. The stakes of this game are neither bragging rights nor pride, they are the very existence of the noble family, and the rights of rulership. The greatest advantage in this game of political infighting is information, preferably that which could shame and discredit a rival. In the pursuit of this sort of information the noble houses of Malfi have each developed methods particular to their own dynasty. It was for this purpose that the first Slate-Agents were trained. The Malfian house which first created the Slate-Agents is long forgotten, whether fallen to obscurity or risen to heights beyond all recognition, none can say. What is well known, however, is the efficacy of the Slate-Agent as a spy and operative. The secrets of creating a Slate-Agent escaped the Malfian backstabber-lords over a century ago, and other powerful organisations in Calixis—namely the Inquisition and the Adeptus Arbites—are known to employ these unique savant-moles for deep undercover work.

Masters of subterfuge and disguise, each Slate-Agent is a perfect operative of infiltration and observation. It is the gruelling process of their creation which makes a Slate-Agent so optimally crafted for their intended job. The first stage of a Slate-Agent's conditioning is aimed at wholly annihilating any sense of self possessed by the recruit, reducing them to little more than a biological machine in the service of their masters. It is from this state that Slate-Agents receive  heir moniker, as from this point forward, each Agent is a "blank-slate" on which new identities can be written. To achieve this, recruits are deprived of sleep, food, water, and dignity, as well as forced to endure horrific psychological torments, all the while they are watched for signs of opposition or rebelliousness. Once the recruit has been reduced to an entirely pliant and workable state, the trainers begin the slow process of rebuilding their charge. Using incredibly complex and methodical hypno-indoctrination techniques they prepare the recruit's mind to take shape around cover-identities, each of which includes skills, history, profession, and contacts, as well as personality and mannerisms, all combined to provide a flawless cover for the Slate-Agent. The trainers use psycho-conditioning to thread the recruit's psyche with triggers and fail-safes, in order to reset the conditioning once their mission is complete. Oft-times the conditioning of Slate-Agents is so complete that during their missions they are wholly unaware of their true identity until their loyalty is tested, at which point, deep-planted hypno-barriers close off the mind to any possibility of traitorous or mutinous thoughts.

Gathering information about one's target is the primary directive of each Agent. Infiltrating a targeted organisation, gaining access to its members' most heavily guarded secrets, and leaving no doubt as to their unfaltering loyalty to their target, these are the core objectives of each Slate- Agent's mission. The specifics may change depending on the Slate-Agent's controller and his targeted organisation, but information is the primary stock and trade of the Slate-Agent. For Malfian agents, having an ally so flawlessly inserted into an enemy's ranks often proves a dangerous temptation, for it is a simple thing to include a kill-order alongside the multitude of mundane orders during the templating process. This form of assassination is harshly frowned upon by the Malfian courts, although only because it would swiftly become a form of mutually assured destruction were this practice to become accepted. For Slate-Agents employed by other organisations, of course, there's often far less hesitation to deploy such an operative for both intelligence-gathering and murder should the opportunity arise.

Malfian Slate-Agents are often considered to be costly but ultimately disposable tools of espionage, meant to be deeply secreted within a rival house to feed information to their masters for as long as possible. Given the ever-changing nature of Inquisitorial work, those Slate-Agents who have been conditioned for use by agents of the Inquisition are often more aware of their true identity, at least subconsciously, and have even been known to have been templated with a multitude of identities at the same time. Slate-Agents in the employ of an Inquisitor can be seen as more of a deck of cards, able to flawlessly shift into a different cover identity as the needs of the mission dictate. This makes them an exceptional weapon to infiltrate corrupt organisations and heretical cults, and unlike the Malfian power-players, the Inquisition is absolutely not above utilising a Slate-Agent to terminate key members of a group they've been secreted into.
### **Becoming a Slate-Agent**
There is no set procedure by which men and women are chosen to become Slate-Agents. Functionally a softer form of mind-cleansing, the process is still painful and harrowing, and only the most absolutely devoted, penitent, or deranged would wholly volunteer to undergo the templating. Many Slate-Agents are coerced into the role by their masters, while others are all but forced to be "slated" as a form of penance for a severe failure. Inquisitors with a more whimsical idea of justice have been known to compel spies who have been caught infiltrating Inquisitorial properties or organisations to accept becoming a Slate-Agent. This allows the outsider to turn their existing talents at subterfuge to the Inquisition's benefit while giving a very effective guarantee of their loyalty to their new masters.

Upon becoming a Slate-Agent, the character gains the **Blank Slate Trait**.

**Required Career**: Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** [Unremarkable](talents.md#unremarkable) Talent
#### **Trait: Blank Slate**
The Acolyte is imprinted with several psychic triggers, known only to his handler. These triggers serve as prompts for the Slate-Agent’s identity programming. One trigger wipes the Slate-Agent’s mind clean of previous imprinting. Another prepares the Agent’s mind for re-programming. When a Slate-Agent is imprinted, the GM and the player may choose three [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore), [Forbidden Lore](skills.md#forbidden%20lore), [Scholastic Lore](skills.md#scholastic%20lore), or [Trade](skills.md#trade) Skills appropriate for the Acolyte’s cover identity. Until the Agent’s imprinting is wiped clean, the Slate-Agent is considered to possess all chosen Skills, and gains a +10 bonus on related Tests.

While an Acolyte's cover identity is "active" the Acolyte completely and totally believes himself to be that person, and even successful [Interrogation](skills.md#interrogation) will only reveal details about the Acolyte's templated persona. Psychic Powers such as [Mind Scan](telepathy.md#mind%20scan) will still reveal the Acolyte's actual identity and the fact that he's had a different identity templated onto him, however. The Acolyte loses all memories of his time under the active cover identity once the trigger is given to wipe his templating, so it is absolutely essential to fully debrief the Slate-Agent before attempting to prepare a new cover identity.

The triggers used to prepare and wipe a Slate-Agent's persona templates must remain absolutely secret, known only to the controller. Should the triggers become known to anyone else that party could implant their own template onto the Slate-Agent, possibly turning him against his masters or to some other no-doubt nefarious purpose.

The second incantation should not be uttered until all the fumes have come forth, then the way shall be clear for the sacred words to penetrate unto the heart of the engine. If the mounting be hot say the third rune, if it be cold the fourth rune is more appropriate. For if the wrong rune is used, the wrath of the engine will be aroused... "*

— excerpt from the *"Book of Five Runes"*
### **Background**
While most would prefer to consign such devices to the furnace, to reclaim its raw materials and start again, some Tech-Priests develop a pronounced interest in analysing corrupted machine spirits, seeking to find the point of failure so as to better understand the corrosive touch of the warp and how the Adeptus Mechanicus might strengthen itself against it. These perpetual outsiders are known as Techsorcists, and most are capable of great feats of intuitive thinking, speculation, and improvisation. Compared to more orthodox Tech-Priests, Techsorcists are particularly well known for contriving and using lateral and often unorthodox processes when strict logic and standard procedures fail. Although they are distrusted by many within the Cult Mechanicus for their free-thinking ways, the Techsorcist treads carefully to avoid crossing the threshold between atypical thought and outright tech-heresy, and they are generally tolerated—if not appreciated—by their conservative peers.

The first Techsorcists are believed to have been created in M36, when a Tech-Priest maniple under the Explorator Magos Eremor delved into the space hulk *Fatum Posterus*, which had recently re-appeared after millennia lost in the warp. Eremor believed that the technology and systems of the agglomeration of voidships, after such an arduous period tossed about on the aetheric currents of the immaterium, could provide great insights on all matters of vexing questions of the day. The expedition was harrowing and fraught with peril, with a good number of Eremor's followers lost to accidents, madness, or the horrific inhabitants of the space hulk's twisted geography. Those who survived came away with a profound new understanding of the limits of a machine spirit's corruptibility and the hideous degeneration even the strongest alloys undergo when suffused with pure warp energy over a long enough time frame. Eremor decreed that these Tech-Priests would become the first Techsorcists, and be charged with awakening their fellows within the Mechanicus to the threats they had seen and how to best combat them.

The Techsorcists, initially considered something of a curiosity, then a suspicious lot to be watched carefully, are now largely lauded by the Inquisition, especially the daemon hunters of the Ordo Malleus. When a questionable device of heretical manufacture is captured or found having a Techsorcist Acolyte on call is a great boon for any Inquisitor, as these unique individuals stand the best chance of being able to analyse the object in question and determine its functions with a minimal risk of whatever corrupted it successfully attacking the Techsorcist in turn. In the Calixis Sector, it is not uncommon for an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor to have several Techsorcists in his retinue, ready to investigate any dubious objects of technological significance that come up in the course of their master's work persecuting daemons and their mortal thralls. Inquisitors of the other Ordos have been known to employ them as well, as the insidious influence of Chaos in all matters germane to Mankind's enemies can rarely be discounted with any level of confidence.

Although they are fully capable of performing the tasks one might expect of a Tech-Priest, Techsorcists have a fraught relationship with many in the Cult Mechanicus. Most find station in the Explorator fleets just as their progenitors did, seeking to gain a greater understanding of how Chaos mutates and adapts technology it comes into contact with. A large minority come to work hand in hand with forces of the Inquisition, to investigate and protect their fellow Acolytes from corrupted devices. This keeps them distinctly isolated from many of the Adeptus Mechanicus' established power structures, and this significant degree of separation means the Archmagi of the Calixian forge worlds often view them with the same scepticism that many Inquisitors take when their orthodox cohorts serve as Inquisitorial Acolytes. The large number of Techsorcists working under Inquisitorial authority has led to a whimsical observation circulating within the Calixian Conclave: that there really ought to be an "Ordo Mechanicus" added to the other established orders of the Inquisition. This, of course, has done little to endear the high authorities of the Martian Priesthood to the situation, who see absolutely no humour in the notion.
### **Becoming a Techsorcist**
Any Tech-Priest with an interest in the corrosive effects the warp has on technology could turn their mechadendrites to such study, but to call oneself a Techsorcist is a more formal process. For those working under Inquisitorial remit, a petition of transfer is created between the Mechanicus and the Ordo of the Inquisition the Techsorcist will be working under. The candidate then undergoes a thorough examination and screening process. If he makes a favourable impression on both the Mechanicus and Inquisitorial representatives, he is then allowed to attempt a final assessment. The Tech-Priest is allowed exactly three hours to review a vast selection of data-archives pertaining to corrupted machine spirits and Chaos-mutated technology, then another three hours to complete a 7,000-question test—a challenging feat even for the augmented minds of most Tech-Priests.

Assuming he passes, the candidate is now recognised as a Techsorcist, and is granted the use of a special mechandendrite armed with hexagrammatic data-gates—this singular tool identifies the Techsorcist from those with an amateur interest in the profane subject in question. So equipped with this tool of the trade, the Techsorcist then begins his service to the Inquisition, where he is likely to become a valuable expert in the nature of corrupted machinery and the unique threat of possessed technology.

Upon becoming a Techsorcist, the Tech-Priest the **Mechadendrite Use (Techsorcism) Talent**.

#### **Talent: Mechadendrite Use (Techsorcism)**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cyber Mantle/Cranial Circuitry)

The Techsorcist has received a very specialised mechadendrite to assist in his duties. This mechadendrite has special techno-arcane wards put in place to resist the effects of corruption from Chaos-infested machine spirits. It also houses a small memory unit for storing proscribed documents and is set to automatically wipe itself upon removal of the mechadendrite or the death of the Techsorcist. When using a mechadendrite the Techsorcist gains a +10 to [Forbidden Lore (Tech-Heresy)](skills.md#forbidden%20lore) Tests, and a +10 to all [Tech-Use](skills.md#tech-use) Tests when interfacing with a corrupted machine spirit. Finally, hexagrammatic data-gates within the mechadendrite provide an additional layer of protection for the Techsorcist. In the event a corrupted piece of technology contains a malignant force, such as warp-infected scrap code or even an actual daemonic presence, using this mechadendrite to interface with it grants the Techsorcist a +10 bonus to any Tests made to resist gaining Corruption, [Possession](traits.md#possession), and so forth.
#### **Talent: Warp Shunt**
**Prerequisites:** Tech-Priest (Cyber Mantle/Cranial Circuitry), Mechadendrite Use (Techsorcism)

Sometimes even the most careful practices and mental fortitude are not enough to deny a corrupting warp influence lurking within a piece of technology. As a last resort, the techsorcism mechadendrite can forcibly disconnect itself from the Techsorcist's cyber mantle to deny a malignant force access to the Techsorcist's mind, although not without cost. When using the mechadendrite to interface with a corrupted machine the Techsorcist may re-roll failed Tests to resist gaining Corruption or being Possessed by whatever malevolent force occupies it. If this re-roll still fails, the Techsorcist's connection to the device is violently severed, immediately ending the attack before he suffers any deleterious effects.

Being forcibly jettisoned from a technological device in this way is not a pleasant experience for the Techsorcist, though it is undoubtedly preferable to a daemon taking up residence in his mind. The Techsorcist immediately gains 2d5 levels of Fatigue as the mechadendrite's internal synapse relays disconnect, and the augmetic cannot be used again until these are reset with a successful **Difficult (–10) Tech-Use Test**.
## **Warp Dabbler**

*"She would have been just a petty recidivist and peddler of harm, one of countless souls of no great worth, but then the warp found her, and she became a true monster. However, as she is a monster loyal to me, you and I are now in conflict."*

— Radical Inquisitor Soldevan to Judge Hiram Fulk of the Adeptus Arbites
##### **Background**
Warp Dabblers, sometimes referred to as warplocks and petty sorcerers, are individuals tampering—often quite nesciently—with the malignant arts of the warp sorcery. Whether cultists, noncompliants, recidivists, or amoral academics, these individuals have had contact with forbidden knowledge and have decided to further explore the possibilities it can offer. These are not true sorcerers or savants of the forbidden, but instead are dark-hearted warriors, soiled enforcers, spiteful adepts, and twisted killers who have acquired a degree of warp lore and have made the perilous decision to put it into use for their own gain. Although they may never achieve the terrible heights of occult power and knowledge that the true masters of sorcery can, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing—especially in the hands of often-desperate individuals on the fringes of society.

Warp Dabblers may have walked almost any path before they begin their dalliance with warp craft. In the case of recidivists and other minor heretics, they may be cultists, criminals, smugglers, or even gang bosses. Others could, at least nominally, be on the straight and narrow, including lesser academics, occultists, and even noble scions. The intelligence and strength of will to study the forbidden is not something that all can do, but should one with the potential be presented with tantalisingly proscribed power, he will often seize it and put it to imaginative (and horrible) use.

Blessedly, the sorts of fell knowledge that could start one down the path of the Warp Dabbler are not easy to obtain. The Imperium is, in general, an insular and ignorant society, and this is just as much by design as it is by cultural norms. The Ecclesiarchy constantly preaches rhetoric designed to inspire dogmatic obedience and abject abhorrence of the heretical and the unknown in equal measure, while the Imperial Inquisition considers censoring and limiting the spread of information considered dangerous or corrupting an absolutely vital task. To the average Imperial citizen, a formal education in academic subjects is a luxury, daemons are distant horrors portrayed in morality plays, and the warp is more of an abstraction of antipathetic feelings than a very real place of unadulterated power and anarchy.

In this social climate, it is onerous to say the least to obtain texts or information about daemonology, the occult, and the immaterium, but it is by no means impossible either. There are few things more consistent in human nature than the desire to possess that which is proscribed or
unobtainable. In the darkest corners of Imperial society—and often its loftiest heights too—banned texts, forbidden tomes, and other instructions in warp craft can be bought, traded, and stolen by someone with the right connections or resources. Tragically, some even find their way into the hands of completely unwitting souls who, in a moment of weakness, turn away from the Ecclesiarchy's blessed ignorance and furtively turn the pages of madness and damnation.

It is an unfortunate irony that the Imperium’s tireless efforts to suppress perilous malefic knowledge mean those who do manage to obtain such information often have little real understanding of just how dangerous it can be. To them, the rituals and incantations are just another tool to obtain their goals, or worse, an amusing frivolity with the supernatural bearing no great significance at all. Only when it is far, far too late, and the leering eyes and grinning mouths of thirsting gods are upon him, does the average Warp Dabbler realise how profoundly his actions have doomed him.

This is not to say, however, that Warp Dabblers are not formidable foes. On the contrary, those who survive long enough, avoiding detection by the Imperial authorities and destruction or insanity from the dread tomes they ply, often possess a combination of low cunning, resourcefulness, and ruthless connivance which makes them quite competent adversaries. In addition, the warp-fueled powers and daemonic allies they can draw on makes them even more dangerous, especially when cornered or desperate. Warp Dabbling crime bosses may take down their rivals with horrors summoned from the warp, while assassins may use sorcery to pass unseen and so eliminate the most heavily guarded of targets with ease. Cultists may attract their followers with forbidden pleasures and dark rewards, while protecting their secrecy with hexes and malefic curses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Warp Dabbler is thus a common quarry for servants of the Inquisition, a burgeoning moral threat who grows in power and danger every day he's left to further hone his hideous craft.

For Inquisitors of a more radical persuasion, cornering a Warp Dabbler who isn't already "too far gone" could be a profitable prospect. A Warp Dabbling Acolyte can call on his knowledge of the dark arts to defeat his opponents, gain a better understanding of their motives and operations, or even bend the powers of the warp against its own vile denizens when they manifest in the materium. When facing the prospect of execution, or worse, few Warp Dabblers would reject a radical Inquisitor's sanction to make something worthwhile of their lives, and with it, perhaps earn redemption in the eyes of the God-Emperor.
### **Becoming a Warp Dabbler**
An Acolyte requires both motive and opportunity to become a Warp Dabbler. At a minimum, the Acolyte must have a source from which he could acquire profane knowledge of the warp, along with the necessary moral flexibility to heedlessly study such subjects and their dire portents. The Acolyte’s Inquisitor might be a source of such possibility, as could contact with warp cults or forbidden tomes, perhaps made during the course of an investigation. Once the Acolyte chooses to dabble in the proscribed, he must spend an amount of time studying or being tutored—usually taking a few months, although a fast reader could conceivably do it quicker—during which time the Acolyte gains 2d10 Corruption Points.

Note that this Alternate Career Rank is intended to represent a more surface-level or casual understanding of the malignancy that is the warp. For Acolytes partaking in true academic study of the immaterium and what lies within, see the [Malefic Scholar](alternate%20career%20ranks.md#malefic%20scholar) Alternate Career Rank.
