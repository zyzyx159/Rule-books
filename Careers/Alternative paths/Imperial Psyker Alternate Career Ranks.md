## **Agent of Reliquary 26**

*“Ours is not an easy task. We gather those most important relics, those symbols of the culture of Mankind. We dare the darkness and travel across the stars clinging to rumour and legend as our guide.”*

— Marcius Dans, Agent of Reliquary 26
### **Background**
Entombed more than a hundred metres beneath the Inquisition's majestic if imposing Tricorn Palace is the Grand Reliquarium, a series of vaults that are home to many artefacts and powerful relics of the Calixis Sector. In these hallowed halls rest hundreds of items of power, from crafted trinkets of the Dark Age of Technology to the blessed weapons of venerable martyrs or even saints. Each of these vaults, of which reliable sources claim there at at least one hundred, are heavily guarded, monitored, and tended to by the Custodiatrix, a small organisation of curator-assassins, each charged with the safety of the artefacts and assigned to one of the vaults. Reliquary 26 contains the relics of the Scholariate at Arms.

In addition to housing artefacts, Reliquary 26 also employs a great number of Agents, men and women who scour the Calixian worlds in search of more items of renown to add to the vaunted collection. Whether through negotiation, deception, or violence, the goal of these Agents is a simple one: ensure the safety and survival of the relics of Man. To do so, they must first identify such items of power, decide whether or not the current ownership is valid, and reclaim the item in question, by force if necessary. Often, Agents act alone or in pairs, though it is not uncommon for an entire cadre of mercenaries to be hired if an acquisition proves particularly difficult. It is rumoured that that the Scholariate at Arms once hired an entire house of assassins to reclaim a relic from the blessed armour of Saint Drusus, though the veracity of such a rumour could never be proven.

As one might expect, Agents of Reliquary 26 are very well outfitted. Although they are relatively unknown as an organisation, members often find themselves at odds with Calixian nobles, Ecclesastical prelates, Rogue Traders, and mercantile magnates—individuals who often value their possessions and do not wish to part with them simply because the Inquisition asks nicely. As a result, many Agents have at least one or two enemies in the upper echelons of Imperial society. Though the agency does attempt to reimburse the owners of the relics they acquire, it is not uncommon for them to have to pry the artefact in question from the lifeless fingers of some greedy soul that simply couldn't part with it for any amount of compensation.

Reliquary 26 works quite closely with the larger Ordos of the Inquisition. Often, Inquisitors find themselves with items of interest left over from an investigation. In exchange for the safe return of any relics or artefacts found by an Inquisitor in the course of his duties, Reliquary 26 will often return the favour by loaning out an item of great power. Many Inquisitors are quite content to employ Agents of Reliquary 26 in their Acolyte cells, profiting from the Agents' access to rare and often powerful devices while maintaining a mutually-beneficial relationship with the Custodiatrix. 
### **Becoming an Agent of Reliquary 26**
An experienced servant of Reliquary 26 is an indispensable resource to an Acolyte cell. When dealing with nobility or other well-to-do types, or in areas where ancient or xenos technology may
be encountered, an Inquisitor would be well served by requisitioning an Agent of Reliquary 26's services. Such Agents usually only serve the Inquisitor the duration of the investigation at hand. Inquisitors who must regularly navigate such treacherous situations have been known to second a trusted Acolyte to the Custodiatrix to be trained in their ways, effectively gaining a permanent "representative" to Reliquary 26's hallowed armoury. As the point of contact between the Grand Reliquarium and the often covetous owners of the sought-after artefacts, most Agents become quite adept at negotiation and tradecraft. Such skills can be invaluable to an Acolyte cell, especially in situations where a hostile acquisition could be more troublesome than normal.

**Required Career:** Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Must have acquired one item of Near Unique Availability or rarer, and turned it over to his Inquisitor or directly to the Grand Reliquarium.
**Aggrieved Parties:** Even if the character has not personally wronged them, at least one group of well-heeled individuals gravely dislikes Reliquary 26. The character gains the [Rival (Ecclesiarchy), (Nobility), or (Rogue Trader)](talents.md#rival) Talent at the GM's discretion.
**Reliquary Loan:** The Grand Reliquarium has resources that include ancient and exotic equipment that is sometimes entrusted to Acolytes serving an Inquisitor. At the beginning of each mission the character gains one valuable item determined by the GM. Unless the character receives some special dispensation, the item must be returned after the mission, with grave consequences for those who try to deprive the Reliquarium of their property. The GM should choose an item that they feel is appropriate to the Acolyte's mission.

## **Cult of the Pure Form**

*"The flesh is strong!"*

— Pure Form maxim
### **Background**
Given the intense liturgical "differences" between them, the Ecclesiarchy and the Adeptus Mechanicus have never enjoyed a healthy working relationship within the Calixis Sector. Conflicts between the two organisations tend to be wars of words, though, political battles fought in the capital worlds of the Sector, rather than outright "shooting wars" between men and machines. Nevertheless, there have been several overt conflicts, such as the attack on the Explorator vessel *Omega Inquiry* from an Adepta Sororitas strike force on the far edges of the Halo Stars. There are no official records of the encounter, but the Tricorn contains sealed datavaults hinting at a heretofore undiscovered abhuman strain that the Mechanicus had uncovered far from civilised space, and the Ministorum’s reactions of horror when their spies reported the discovery. Greatly displeasured by the loss of the Explorator coterie, a Mechanicus Secutor cohort laid waste to two outpost convents in retaliation, and was about to escalate further before secretive diplomacy and unnamed offerings negotiated by third parties settled the matter. Such incidents are still rare, but with the gradual rise of a group calling itself the Cult of the Pure Form, this could begin to change.

It is not known exactly who founded the Cult of the Pure Form, but their influence began in the Malfian Sub-Sector in the immediate aftermath of the Malygrisian Heresy. The traitorous Tech- Priest and his followers ravaged numerous worlds with their devastating weaponry, and some began to think that the existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus would lead to another, inevitable war. The followers of this emerging cult feared that this coming doom would scour humankind from the galaxy, leaving only the cold, barely-human flesh and machine hybrids of the Mechanicus domains behind. This twisted line of logic grew quickly until the first major anti-Mechanicum movement of the Calixis Sector’s history began to swell, with loud marches and violent demonstrations.

In an unexpected move, and one that likely came about due to Cult Mechanicus political manoeuvring on Scintilla, the Sector Synod declared the emergent cult apostate. Over the next decades the cult leaders began to disappear, some dying in mysterious accidents while others perished in what were clearly outright assassinations. Some thought that the Inquisition was to blame, and others whispered of the Officio Assassinorum’s involvement, but very few were aware that the secretive Lords Dragon of the Mechancius bore sole responsibility for this early intervention, and that their clandestine methods had managed to stifle the movement before it
could truly become established. For its part, the Calixian Inquisition viewed this suppression as a grievous overstep of the Lords Dragon's authority beyond the realm of the Lathes, and it was made abundantly clear to the Magi that another transgression of that scale would engulf them in a true shadow war they were not liable to win.

After more high-level negotiation, the Lords Dragon agreed to cease their campaign of suppression, handing over all information they had gathered on the new sect for the Inquisition to process as it saw fit. While the watchers of the Panopticon hoped that the Inquisition would continue their work in stamping out the Cult of the Pure Form, the Conclave determined it was largely harmless to the broader Imperium, and contented themselves to merely monitoring its activities for emergent signs of heresy.

With the bionic boot of the Lords Dragon permanently removed from its figurative throat, the Cult of the Pure Form rose once again, finding succour and eager supporters anywhere common men took umbrage to the Mechanicus' abuses or superstitious fear of its unknowable rites. This time, however, a new generation of cult leaders threw out its previous methods in favour of a slower approach, and rather than attempting to whip the people of a single sub-sector into a frenzy, they would instead choose to let their hatred for the Mechanicus gradually simmer on worlds across the entire Sector.

A second blow came in the form of Ignato Borja, the new Arch-Cardinal of the Sector Synod. Under Ignato's stewardship the Ecclesiarchy curiously refrained denouncing the reformed Cult of the Pure Form. Indeed, Mechanicus spies close to the Ministorum's prelates reported that, at least unofficially, the Ecclesiarchy was quite content to allow the reach of the Pure Form cultists to grow, seeing any harm it might cause the Mechanicus as a potential gain for themselves. Even the Inquisition would be of no aid—initially suspicious of the Pure Form's return to prominence, many of the more puritanical Inquisitors who looked into the cult's ways began to see them in a positive light, emulating agreeable philosophies about the sanctity of the human body and acting as valuable check against the Mechanicus' own clandestine efforts.

Their mechadendrites tied, the Lords Dragon have been forced to passively observe as the Cult of Pure Form rose to prominence once more. Like clockwork, any egregious display of the Mechanicus' power beyond its forge worlds—an Explorator press-gang crew riving through starport public houses, or servitor-artisans systemically scooping up dregs in a hab-vault—is likely to be followed up by an agitator from the Pure Form arriving to preach about the sin and hubris of the Martian Priesthood.

As a matter of liturgy, the Cult of the Pure Form’s members—most of them, anyway—do not hate the Adeptus Mechanicus purely for their worship of the Omnissiah, and neither are they explicitly anti-technology. They simply wish to wrest control of such power away from the Mechanicus, proffering the provincial view that “uncorrupted” humans might control it instead. Their true ire stems from the extensive use of cybernetics and other mechanical implants that virtually every member of the Adeptus Mechanicus possesses. To the cult, the most pure form in the universe is that of the human body, an image of the God-Emperor Himself, and to defile it by removing untainted flesh and grafting on artificial limbs and organs is blasphemy in its own right.

Quite a few members of the Cult of the Pure Form have cybernetic implants when they join. These souls are often spurred on by dissatisfaction with low quality or cheap implants, or suffer a form of "cyberpsychosis" where they cannot perceive their augments as part of their own body and come to loathe their presence. These cultists undergo a ritual known as the Purity of Flesh to remove the implants from their bodies. 

This ritual often leaves the participant missing limbs or eyes, and can rob them of their ability to hear or even speak. Known as the “Shriven” by other Pure Form cultists, these blessed men and women are highly regarded, having seen the purity of the human body as it was meant to be and unshackling themselves from the augmetic prisons of the Mechanicus. Most will choose to replace their removed cybernetics with strictly fleshy equivalents, often vat-grown examples cultivated for the individual Shriven in question, although some are forced to make do with biomatter reclaimed and purified from servitors or harvested from executed criminals. Especially pious cultists have been known to reject even this, however, getting by with purely inert prostheses and simply accepting the loss of ability that comes from a missing body part as an intractable and, indeed, necessary aspect of the human condition.

The bulk of the cult’s ranks, however, are made up of those fortunate enough to have lived without the defilement of cybernetics, and are referred to as the “Untouched.” Each Untouched member comes to the sect for different reasons, but most are spurred on by a love of the God-Emperor as a human paragon and an inherent mistrust of, or an outright animus towards, the Adeptus Mechanicus.

The Cult of the Pure Form does not sit by and wait passively for people to see its point of view, and indeed instituted their own group of missionaries. This third group is the most powerful within the cult, and are known as the “Reformed.” Acting as the public face of the cult, the Reformed are a large, sector-spanning network. They commonly preach that the God-Emperor had not a single cybernetic in the days when He walked amongst mortals, and that if He was pure of flesh, then so too should His subjects be. The Reformed mainly consist of Shriven who have reversed the process of bionic implantation, creating implants not of unholy cybernetics, but instead made out of pure (if sometimes misshapen) flesh. To the Reformed any inefficiencies or inferior function these parts have compared to the soulless steel they replaced is simply an expression of faith and piousness towards the very idea of the Pure Form itself.
### **Becoming a Cultist of the Pure Form**
There are many ways to be tempted to join the Cult of the Pure Form. For some, it is due to a feeling of betrayal, where replacement cybernetics have caused more harm than good, and the poor soul shackled by them is looking for a form of release among the ranks of the Shriven. Others, after hearing the words of the Reformed, have come to understand that the continued existence of the Adeptus Mechanicus is nothing but a disaster waiting to happen, and that it is their holy duty to stand in judgement of this abominable organisation. Others join out of a fear that if they begin to receive cybernetics that they will lose something of their own souls, and eagerly join the ranks of the Untouched to avoid this horrific fate. A select few might even be contacted directly by the cult’s senior members, as their membership would greatly benefit the cult’s standing and appeal across the Sector. The cult also offers a strong brotherhood and a cause to motivate new meaning into previously meaningless lives. Those who achieve such purity in their flesh may find their spirit even stronger than before, and certainly stronger than those who foolishly trust their bodies to the uncaring and dispassionate machine.

Upon becoming a member of the Cult of the Pure Form, the character gains the **Excommunicate Mechanicum Trait**.

**Required Career:** Any except Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Cleric—Rank 2 or higher (500 xp); All others—Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** Any Acolyte who possess any bionics/cybernetics when taking this Alternate Rank must take the Purity of Flesh Talent before he may take any further Advances. Acolytes who do not possess any bionics/cybernetics when selecting this Rank must select the Gift of Purity Talent before they may take any further Advances.
#### **Trait: Excommunicate Mechanicum**
The Cult of the Pure Form is not a secretive group, in which members meet covertly in dank basements or crumbling hab blocks. They have made their presence felt and do not feel the need to hide their beliefs. The Mechanicus, in turn, view them as dangerous, misguided fools, and treat them with open disdain at best optimal servitor components at worst. Should any member of the Machine Cult learn of the Acolyte’s true allegiance, there could be dire consequences. If discovered, treat any member of the Mechanicus as having the lowest possible Disposition towards the character (and vice versa). The GM may even, in extreme situations, determine that acts of outright violence might be called for. Additionally, all forms of Interaction—even just speaking with members of the Machine Cult—are to be treated as **Arduous (–40)** before factoring in other modifiers.

*†This Talent has no xp cost, but can only be selected under specific circumstances. See each Talent's description for details.*
#### **Talent: Gift of Purity**
The Acolyte has forsaken the cybernetic, cast out the desire for the bionic, and joined the ranks of the Untouched. Never will sacred flesh be sullied by the implantation of devices that rob the Acolyte of his purity. The character cannot, under any circumstances, choose or accept the implantation of cybernetics/bionics, even if the result of refusing them would result in certain death. If the character finds himself implanted with cybernetics/bionics against his will, then he must remove them as soon as possible, replacing this Talent with the Purity of Flesh instead. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase, and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have no cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank.
#### **Talent: Purity of Flesh**
The Acolyte has participated in the Purity of Flesh ritual and emerged alive. Taking his place amongst the Shriven, he has become truly blessed, and despite his missing limbs, eyes, and other organs, he feels more complete now than he ever did with his soulless metallic attachments. All cybernetics and bionics that the character had previously must be removed, including internal cybernetic implants. If doing so would normally result in the character’s death, such as in the case of a Bionic Respiratory System, the character must also take the Reformed Skin Talent to provide a life-saving replacement, permanently reducing his Toughness by 1d5 and Wounds by 1.

The effects of removing cybernetic implants is similar to sustaining [Critical Damage](injury%20and%20healing.md#serious%20injuries%20and%20conditions) and the Acolyte should be attended to by a trained medicae to reduce the risk of death from the process. Augmetics that provide additional specific effects, such as a mind impulse unit or bio-power cells, cease to do so once removed from the body. The character gains 1 additional Fate Point (up to a maximum of 5) for every two bionics that he has removed (with the exception of Mechadendrites). The character must remove each and every augmetic from his body before he receives this benefit, so characters with quite a few may need to spend considerable downtime recuperating between surgeries (allowing their Critical Damage to heal) before they increase their Fate Points. 

This Talent costs no xp to purchase and is automatically granted to members of the Cult of the Pure Form who have cybernetics/bionics when they take the Alternate Rank. The character counts as having the Gift of Purity Talent for the purposes of refusing new cybernetics.
#### **Talent: Reformed Skin**
For those Acolytes who prefer to remain whole physically as well as spiritually they may take on entirely new flesh to replace the hateful cybernetics that have been removed. A Cultist of the Pure Form may select this Talent as many times as he has missing limbs, senses, or organs—any human body part replaced with a cybernetic or lost due to Critical Damage.

When taken, the Acolyte gains a replacement body part reclaimed from a servitor or an executed criminal. The replacement is not a perfect analogue for the Acolyte's original flesh, however, and imposes the same penalties that a Poor Craftsmanship cybernetic would (and, obviously, does not confer a bonus to his Toughness or a reduced chance of death from Critical Effects). Superior examples, vat-grown in bioreactors to closely match the Acolyte's body, may be purchased for 75% the cost of a cybernetic replacement instead—these effectively duplicate the Acolyte's missing parts and impose no penalties on their use (but still doesn't grant any special benefits or effects that an augmetic part might).

Any Fate Points gained from the Purity of Flesh Talent are lost when the missing parts are replaced with Reformed Skin, so the pious cultist should consider carefully how much he's willing to go without when considering a flesh-crafted replacement. Unless the missing body part would lead to inevitable death, such as a bionic cardiac system, the Acolyte is under no obligation to actually take this Talent. Reformed Skin costs no xp to purchase, though there may be a cost in Thrones if the Acolyte wishes to utilise a better quality part.
## **Imperial Diviner**

*“He who stares long into the Abyss should take care, lest the Abyss begin to stare back…”*

— ancient Terran proverb
### **Background**
Imperial Diviners are Sanctioned Psykers who have focused their powers and abilities of divination to produce great, if fickle, feats of prophecy and prediction. This is a dangerous path, fraught not only with the difficulties and inaccuracies of foretelling itself, but also holds great risks to the sanity and soul of the Psyker involved. The rewards, however can be great, and for many radical Inquisitors, the chance to detect and purge the guilty before they have the chance to commit their atrocities is more than worth the risk.

The prediction of the future, or to be more accurate, the foreshadowing of things that may yet come to pass, is a thing of great interest to many within the Inquisition, just as it is to the Chaos Cult, witch, or indeed any other member of the Imperium’s great and powerful who lend credence to the diviner’s abilities. Of course, such prognostications are never fully reliable, and for many who distrust such arts, particularly those in the puritan faction of the Holy Ordos, one might as well listen to the lies that pour direct from a daemon’s mouth as trust a diviner’s visions.

Many of those who have gazed long into the warp for answers and omens have been changed profoundly and come to know things that, for sanity's sake, no mortal mind should. Some break and flee in terror from their visions, or succumb to madness as their grip on what's real and what's a warp-spawned hallucination falters, while others endure but come to view their gifts as an agonising curse, one they can neither resist nor escape. A few, despite the assurance of the Scholastica Psykana's sanctioning, come to embrace what the warp shows them, balancing perilously on a razor's edge above absolute damnation to see just a little bit further or more clearly into the future.

Of all the radicals within the Calixian Conclave, the little understood and highly secretive Ocularians are singularly obsessed with foretelling and the casting and fulfilment of prophecies, and most Imperial Diviners found within the Inquisition’s ranks in the Sector count among their number. A small number of Diviners truck with other sects of the Inquisition's radical faction, typically seeking to employ their supreme prognostication for more "mundane" purposes than the Ocularians' religious fixation on decoding prophecies.

The puritan faction, on the other hand, takes a rather dim view of the Imperial Diviner's talents. Even putting aside the Monodominants' intense hatred of Psykers, the rest of the puritans are sceptical at best of any benefit to such an intimate level of familiarity with the warp's anarchic ebbs and flows. The Scholastica Psykana has also expressed disapproval at the very notion of trying to delve even deeper into their studies of divination, as this would take the Psyker far beyond the thresholds established to help preserve their sanity.
### **Becoming an Imperial Diviner**
All a skilled Psyker with divinatory abilities need do to become an Imperial Diviner is make the conscious decision that peering ever deeper into the swirling, inscrutable sea of fate is worth the risk of whatever mind-shattering or soul-corrupting unpleasantness he might find there. To hone one's psychic perceptions to such an edge, opening the mind all the way in order to fully take in the portents of futures that can only be seen in the depths of the immaterium, is a perilous proposition. Psykers not possessed of strong mental fortitude have been known to lose themselves entirely in their divinatory visions, while others begin to take on aspects of the vile, inhuman entities whose voices they hear with their dangerously expanded senses.

The process of becoming an Imperial Diviner is deceptively simple. A Psyker who is aware of the protective conditioning received as part of their Psykana sanctioning can effectively "shut it off" with intensive ritual meditation and performing psychic augury on himself. As part of this process the Psyker must make a **Hard (–20) Psyniscience Test**, with success indicating the new Imperial Diviner has managed to delve into this deeper layer of divination without any immediate degradation of their mind or soul. Failure means profound visions and the dangerous temptation of staring ever longer into the warp has ensnared the Psyker, and he gains 2d5 Insanity Points, plus another 1d5 for each degree of failure. If the Psyker gains more than 10 Insanity Points as a result of failing this Test, he also gains 1d10 Corruption Points as well. The Psyker may still become an Imperial Diviner either way, the results of this Test merely indicate how steep of a cost it was.

**Required Career:** Imperial Psyker

#### **Talent: Visions of the Abyss**
Prerequisites: Personal Augury Psychic Power

To progress as an Imperial Diviner is to have survived gazing into the seething anarchy of the warp time and again, and the Psyker must become at least partly inured to its visions or have long since succumbed to madness. Whenever called on to suffer Corruption Points due to [Warp Shock](fear%20and%20damnation.md#warp%20shock) or similar circumstances, they reduce the amount taken by –1 (minimum 1). 
## **Ordo Sicarius Initiate**

"Some may be able to avoid the Judges of the Adeptus Arbites. Fewer may be able to face off against the Imperial Guard, and perhaps even the Adeptus Astartes. None can stand against the Officio Assassinorum."

— Tarik Ziz, Callidus Director Secundus
### **Background**
At the end of the Age of Apostasy and Goge Vandire’s despotic rule came a shadow conflict few have heard of and many participants did not survive: the Wars of Vindication within the Officio Assassinorum. The Officio had become riddled with corruption, and the Grand Master of Assassins was forced to kill many of its members in order to fully eliminate those still loyal to the deposed High Lord or who had fallen into irredeemable degeneracy during his rule. The Officio’s hierarchy was utterly shattered and needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, and for a time there was some discussion amongst the new High Lords that the Officio itself might be dissolved. 

As fellows of clandestine warfare, the Inquisition came to the Officio Assassinorum's aid during this moment of great peril. Following a thorough investigation and taking of accounts, Inquisitor Jaeger of the Ordo Hereticus deemed that a special order of the Inquisition would be created to help rebuild the Officio, and subsequently monitor and control some of its functions much more
closely than had occurred before. His proposal was accepted, and the Ordo Sicarius was created, with Jeager as its first Lord Inquisitor. As the Officio Assassinorum is a highly secretive branch of the Imperial hierarchy, Jeager and his henchmen understood that maintaining a typical hierarchy of control was out of the question. To preserve the Officio's ability to rive seamlessly through Imperial society the Ordo Sicarius would not maintain any formal structures outside it, instead fulfilling their duty by planting Assassin-Acolytes and, indeed, a few Inquisitors within their ranks. 

The masters of the Assassinorum know of the existence of these Ordo Sicarius agents, but not their number, postings, or individual identities. The Assassinorum and Sicarius follow an informal set of guidelines toward their unusual arrangement. Officially, the Officio Assassinorum does not attempt to expose or identify Sicarius agents, but those who are identified are marked and reported as such to their masters, who will withdraw and reassign the "made" agent. In return, if a Sicarius agent does uncover heresy or some dire conspiracy within the Assassinorum, the Ordo Sicarius will work in cooperation with the rest of the Officio to excise the malignant element with an absolute minimum disruption to their operations. Once a Sicarius agent is "made", his time secreted within the Officio Assassinorum is over, but the Inquisition has a great many other tasks that an expert at deception and guile could turn their hands to.

One notable example of the Ordo Sicarius' work dates from the early years of the 39th Millennium. Praetor Golgenna Angevin, a well-connected noble of the Terran Court, was raised to the rank of Lord Militant and granted a writ to prosecute a crusade to liberate and return the worlds of the Calyx Expanse to the Imperial fold. Among a cadre of Angevin's trusted counsellors and chamberlains was a man by the name of Dario Vereschagin. Unknown to Angevin or any of the others at the time, this servant was in actuality one Inquisitor Treyus Godan of the Ordo Sicarius. Inquisitor Godan's purpose was to monitor Angevin's crusade and to determine, on behalf of the Inquisition, whether or not such a singularly powerful individual was still loyal to the Imperium and faithfully executing the duties he was charged with. If he was not, then it was Godan's duty to eliminate him before Angevin turned the vast forces of the Crusade towards his own ends. A number of members of the Inquisition were openly serving in the forces of the Crusade, and could ostensibly fulfil the same purpose as Godan, but if the Lord Militant did betray the Imperium these badge-wearing agents and Inquisitors could conceivably be eliminated, or worse, co-opted. Godan, then, could serve as an additional measure to guarantee Angevin's loyalty. 

As the Crusade entered its third and final stage, Godan personally witnessed Angevin's acclaimed General Drusus slain by a rogue assassin. When Drusus rose from the dead, Godan was one of the first of the Crusade's leaders to recognise him as a living saint, a sure sign that the God-Emperor had blessed the Crusade's success with His divinity. Capitalising on this moment, Godan "revealed" himself as an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus and officially (albeit without any sort of formal authorisation) declared the Inquisition's support of the new living saint. Reinvigorated by this moment of holy righteousness (and significant resources diverted by Inquisitorial forces) the Crusade barrelled ahead with newfound vigour, and most of the remaining worlds of Calyx were returned to the God-Emperor's light not long thereafter. Critically, by making the resurrection of Drusus a matter of Inquisitorial import, the conspirators who had him assassinated were outed, and the possibility of a religious schism over whether Drusus was truly a living saint or not was quickly put to rest before it could threaten the Crusade's revitalised momentum.

Godan, for his part, was censured for impersonating an Inquisitor, but received clemency in light of the undeniable results of his duplicity, and disappeared from the record shortly thereafter. Only a few within the Inquisition ever knew Godan was a member of the Ordo Sicarius, much less had been clandestinely monitoring the Crusade's progress and guiding the hands of its leaders the entire time. To this day, even many within the Holy Ordos are only vaguely aware of the existence of the Sicarius in the first place, but few would doubt their capability at deception and the crafting of cover identities for deep infiltration. Inquisitors whose work entails delicate and surreptitious investigation are often pleased to have an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius in their service, although some might give pause to the notion that the Sicarius-trained Acolyte could be keeping tabs on them at the same time...
### **Becoming an Ordo Sicarius Initiate**
Becoming an initiate of the Ordo Sicarius is no simple feat. The Acolyte in question must be both a skilled warrior and very capable at subterfuge. The vast majority of its members were chosen for induction by Assassin-Inquisitors of the Ordo Sicarius itself, the prospective initiates merely given a dataslate with the name of a target, and a stated goal of "Interrogation and Extermination required" written underneath. How, or even if, the prospect goes about this mission is his decision. Assuming the assignment is successfully completed, and the work is judged to be adequate, the prospect is clandestinely taken to the Ordo Sicarius' main temple and begins his training in the ways of the Assassin-Inquisitors.

†*You may select this Talent up to three times for this Alternate Rank.*
#### **Talent: Sicarius Training**
The time an Acolyte spends among the most ruthless and efficient agents of stealth, deception, and murder can manifest itself in all matters of ways. Acolytes who study with agents of the Callidus Temple learn the ways of deep infiltration and flawless disguise, whilst those who spend their time among the Vindicare become highly proficient lurkers and shadesmen who can slip through security like water through a sieve. Each time you purchase this Talent select one of the following benefits:

* **Arms Aficionado:** At some point you developed a particular interest in an unusual weapon, and the Ordo Sicarius has had you study with a master of that device to further your deadly ambitions. You gain an [Exotic Weapon Training](talents.md#exotic%20weapon%20training) Talent of your choice.
* **Blackjack:** Months of working alongside the most resolute killers in Calixis has taught you how to unnerve even the most hardened adversaries with your baleful presence alone. You gain the [Disturbing Voice](talents.md#disturbing%20voice) Talent.
* **Blade Dancer:** Many Assassins are inclined to take their quarry up close, preferring the tactile certainty of the sword and dagger over a gun or bomb. You've come to see their way of thinking. You gain your choice of either the [Sure Strike](talents.md#sure%20strike) or [Swift Attack](talents.md#swift%20attack) Talent.
* **Demanding Tutelage:** Your training has ruthlessly tested the limitations of what your body can  endure, but your masters were thoughtful and wise enough to only bring you the edge of what you can recuperate from. You gain the [Sound Constitution](talents.md#sound%20constitution) Talent.
* **Logical Liar:** You have memorised a staggering number of reasonable responses to common  inquiries and can craft rationally believable falsehoods on-the-fly. You may substitute your Intelligence Characteristic in place of Fellowship when making Deceive Tests.
* **Part of the Scenery:** Your tutors have taught you to remain motionless for hours and possibly even days on end, your exact position monitored by unblinking servitors for even the slightest twitch. You gain the [Talented (Concealment)](talents.md#talented) Talent. If you already possess this Talent, its bonus increases to +15 instead of the usual +10.
* **Thought Mapping:** Infiltrator-savants of the Sicarius have taught you the science of predicting lines of questioning, and through logistaristic formulae you can often predict the path of a conversation well ahead of those you're speaking with. You may substitute your Intelligence Characteristic in place of Fellowship when making Inquiry Tests.
* **Well Connected:** A myriad of false identities, pulled strings, and brazen yet surprisingly convincing lies has created a persona with contacts in a useful organisation or social group. You gain a [Peer](talents.md#peer) Talent of your choice.
* **Wraith:** You have spent countless hours tracking masters of the art of stealth, honing an ability to think ahead and predict your prey's clandestine movements. You gain the [Talented (Shadowing)](talents.md#talented) Talent. If you already possess this Talent, its bonus increases to +15 instead of the usual +10.

Note that if a benefit of this Talent grants you another Talent you must still be able to meet the prerequisites, if any, for that Talent in order to accept it.
## **Saboteur**

*"Any problem in the world can be solved with the careful application of high explosives. The trick is not to be around when they go off."*

— attributed to an ancient Terran warlord
### **Background**
It is said by some of the more philosophically-minded Administratum thralls that everything within the Imperium is connected by endless invisible threads of interdependence, a vast web of commerce, trade, and movement of men that binds the whole together. From the astropathic messages brought to the table of a lord, to the food eaten by the lowest worker in a forge, all depends on something else to exist, and those in turn on other things. These threads of reliance form a vast entanglement of power and stability on which order, faith, and indeed survival itself depends. It is the destruction of these threads that is the Saboteur’s purpose, and for many, their most beloved art.

Saboteurs are craftsmen of panic, destruction, and downfall—sometimes all three at once! They are the loosed dogs of secret wars of destabilisation and terror that rage in the shadows of the Imperium of Mankind. Trained to move unseen amongst the great flocks of humanity, the Saboteur is a faceless agent of fear, mayhem, and death that attacks the physical and psychological fabric that binds the Imperium together. Many act as tools or proxies of larger conspiracies, sowing fear among the people and crippling the local authorities' means to resist the hideous plans of the Saboteur's employers. Others ply their trade for their own goals alone, seeking to topple institutions and spires out of personal animus for the rulers and powerful, or even just for the perverse joy of destruction itself.

Acolytes of the Inquisition are most likely to encounter a Saboteur in the course of an investigation, and will almost certainly be attempting to thwart the Saboteur's plans before they can threaten the very fabric of Imperial society. Yet, it is also not unheard-of for such cold monsters of terror to be found in the service of an Inquisitor. While unconventional in the main, it is true that grand conspiracies and heretical sects often depend on their own networks of information and material to enact their vile plots. Once uncovered, these can be severed with explosives and other clandestine, underhanded tactics just as easily, if not more so, than with a Storm Trooper deployment or a raid by an Arbites Suppression Squad. 

Sometimes a very deeply-rooted heresy can corrupt planetary authorities to its will or ephemerally secret itself within local institutions, becoming all but undetectable to even the all-seeing eye of the Inquisition. In such situations, a more radical Inquisitor might set loose Saboteur Acolytes to destabilise those very organisations, depriving the heretics of the facade of normality and pushing them out into the open. The cost in both infrastructure and innocent lives is often high, but those who would deliberately send an entire hive into anarchy to expose dire conspiracies within its guild halls and enforcer forts are quick to point out that a more "conventional", that is to say brute force, approach would likely be even worse.
### **Becoming a Saboteur**
A Saboteur's qualifications are deceptively simple: move surreptitiously and cause a great deal of targeted destruction. A Saboteur Acolyte will often lean on the training and institutional knowledge of his existing Career to identify structural and organisational weaknesses, areas where a little explosives or poison gas will have outsize effects on the body he's been called to cripple. No two Saboteurs are alike, and such an Acolyte is just as likely to be a dutiful servant calmly practising a trade for his master as he is to be a barely-contained menace, gleefully terrorising his fellow men with official justification that's often entirely too flimsy.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp).

## **Slate-Agent**

*"And who am I to be this year, hmm? A wealthy functionary in a dubious merchant guild? No? Hmm, perhaps a pampered Ecclesiastic keeping watch for detestable heresy within a suspect sect? Still no, eh? Well then, can I spend the majority of this mission indoors at least? Another Imperial Guard unit? How do heretics keep managing to sneak into those! Well at least I won't remember any of it after retrieval..."*

— a Slate-Agent, currently named Cavel Posdanik
### **Background**
On the planet of Malfi, a place often considered the "second capital" of the Calixis Sector, the men and women of the ruling class play a vicious game of politics and favour. This game is played not on any game-board, but in every palace, mansion, and villa. It is not played with pieces, but with the livelihood of their dynasties. The strategy of this game lies with political manoeuvring and favourable alliances. The stakes of this game are neither bragging rights nor pride, they are the very existence of the noble family, and the rights of rulership. The greatest advantage in this game of political infighting is information, preferably that which could shame and discredit a rival. In the pursuit of this sort of information the noble houses of Malfi have each developed methods particular to their own dynasty. It was for this purpose that the first Slate-Agents were trained. The Malfian house which first created the Slate-Agents is long forgotten, whether fallen to obscurity or risen to heights beyond all recognition, none can say. What is well known, however, is the efficacy of the Slate-Agent as a spy and operative. The secrets of creating a Slate-Agent escaped the Malfian backstabber-lords over a century ago, and other powerful organisations in Calixis — namely the Inquisition and the Adeptus Arbites — are known to employ these unique savant-moles for deep undercover work.

Masters of subterfuge and disguise, each Slate-Agent is a perfect operative of infiltration and observation. It is the gruelling process of their creation which makes a Slate-Agent so optimally crafted for their intended job. The first stage of a Slate-Agent's conditioning is aimed at wholly annihilating any sense of self possessed by the recruit, reducing them to little more than a biological machine in the service of their masters. It is from this state that Slate-Agents receive  heir moniker, as from this point forward, each Agent is a "blank-slate" on which new identities can be written. To achieve this, recruits are deprived of sleep, food, water, and dignity, as well as forced to endure horrific psychological torments, all the while they are watched for signs of opposition or rebelliousness. Once the recruit has been reduced to an entirely pliant and workable state, the trainers begin the slow process of rebuilding their charge. Using incredibly complex and methodical hypno-indoctrination techniques they prepare the recruit's mind to take shape around cover-identities, each of which includes skills, history, profession, and contacts, as well as personality and mannerisms, all combined to provide a flawless cover for the Slate-Agent. The trainers use psycho-conditioning to thread the recruit's psyche with triggers and fail-safes, in order to reset the conditioning once their mission is complete. Oft-times the conditioning of Slate-Agents is so complete that during their missions they are wholly unaware of their true identity until their loyalty is tested, at which point, deep-planted hypno-barriers close off the mind to any possibility of traitorous or mutinous thoughts.

Gathering information about one's target is the primary directive of each Agent. Infiltrating a targeted organisation, gaining access to its members' most heavily guarded secrets, and leaving no doubt as to their unfaltering loyalty to their target, these are the core objectives of each Slate- Agent's mission. The specifics may change depending on the Slate-Agent's controller and his targeted organisation, but information is the primary stock and trade of the Slate-Agent. For Malfian agents, having an ally so flawlessly inserted into an enemy's ranks often proves a dangerous temptation, for it is a simple thing to include a kill-order alongside the multitude of mundane orders during the templating process. This form of assassination is harshly frowned upon by the Malfian courts, although only because it would swiftly become a form of mutually assured destruction were this practice to become accepted. For Slate-Agents employed by other organisations, of course, there's often far less hesitation to deploy such an operative for both intelligence-gathering and murder should the opportunity arise.

Malfian Slate-Agents are often considered to be costly but ultimately disposable tools of espionage, meant to be deeply secreted within a rival house to feed information to their masters for as long as possible. Given the ever-changing nature of Inquisitorial work, those Slate-Agents who have been conditioned for use by agents of the Inquisition are often more aware of their true identity, at least subconsciously, and have even been known to have been templated with a multitude of identities at the same time. Slate-Agents in the employ of an Inquisitor can be seen as more of a deck of cards, able to flawlessly shift into a different cover identity as the needs of the mission dictate. This makes them an exceptional weapon to infiltrate corrupt organisations and heretical cults, and unlike the Malfian power-players, the Inquisition is absolutely not above utilising a Slate-Agent to terminate key members of a group they've been secreted into.
### **Becoming a Slate-Agent**
There is no set procedure by which men and women are chosen to become Slate-Agents. Functionally a softer form of mind-cleansing, the process is still painful and harrowing, and only the most absolutely devoted, penitent, or deranged would wholly volunteer to undergo the templating. Many Slate-Agents are coerced into the role by their masters, while others are all but forced to be "slated" as a form of penance for a severe failure. Inquisitors with a more whimsical idea of justice have been known to compel spies who have been caught infiltrating Inquisitorial properties or organisations to accept becoming a Slate-Agent. This allows the outsider to turn their existing talents at subterfuge to the Inquisition's benefit while giving a very effective guarantee of their loyalty to their new masters.

Upon becoming a Slate-Agent, the character gains the **Blank Slate Trait**.

**Required Career**: Any
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 6 or higher (6,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** [Unremarkable](talents.md#unremarkable) Talent
#### **Trait: Blank Slate**
The Acolyte is imprinted with several psychic triggers, known only to his handler. These triggers serve as prompts for the Slate-Agent’s identity programming. One trigger wipes the Slate-Agent’s mind clean of previous imprinting. Another prepares the Agent’s mind for re-programming. When a Slate-Agent is imprinted, the GM and the player may choose three [Common Lore](skills.md#common%20lore), [Forbidden Lore](skills.md#forbidden%20lore), [Scholastic Lore](skills.md#scholastic%20lore), or [Trade](skills.md#trade) Skills appropriate for the Acolyte’s cover identity. Until the Agent’s imprinting is wiped clean, the Slate-Agent is considered to possess all chosen Skills, and gains a +10 bonus on related Tests.

While an Acolyte's cover identity is "active" the Acolyte completely and totally believes himself to be that person, and even successful [Interrogation](skills.md#interrogation) will only reveal details about the Acolyte's templated persona. Psychic Powers such as [Mind Scan](telepathy.md#mind%20scan) will still reveal the Acolyte's actual identity and the fact that he's had a different identity templated onto him, however. The Acolyte loses all memories of his time under the active cover identity once the trigger is given to wipe his templating, so it is absolutely essential to fully debrief the Slate-Agent before attempting to prepare a new cover identity.

The triggers used to prepare and wipe a Slate-Agent's persona templates must remain absolutely secret, known only to the controller. Should the triggers become known to anyone else that party could implant their own template onto the Slate-Agent, possibly turning him against his masters or to some other no-doubt nefarious purpose.

## **Tainted Psyker**

*“We are shackled gods. It is not others that restrain our potential, for they have no such power, but we ourselves. We forge and wear our own shackles because we know what we dream ourselves to be, and fear it.”*

— attributed to a renegade alpha-class Psyker known as "The Burning Princess"
### **Background**
All Psykers with at least some basic knowledge of their eldritch gift know that the source of their unnatural power is the warp, that gloriously anarchic realm of emotions and primordial forces. The wise understand that this is a precarious existence, as while the warp promises untold power for those with the will to grasp it, it also inevitably extracts a hideous cost from beguiled mortals who deign themselves to control it. For sanctioned Imperial Psykers, one of the core tenets of their Scholastica Psykana tutelage is that of restraint—to treat the warp as the delusive and capricious sea of madness that it is, and to only draw upon it ever so lightly.

Of course, desire exists in the hearts of all men, and Psykers are no exception. Even those who have honoured their mentors and treated their psychic gifts with due care are often tempted to draw deeper and reach further, especially in moments of extreme duress. Another lightning arc or a greater fire storm can save a Psyker's life when overwhelmed by ravening mutants, an even stronger telepathic push can pierce the mental defences of an especially hardened cult leader—the potential justifications are limitless, and the first step down this ruinous path is a shockingly simple process.

Tainted Psykers are those unfortunate souls who have given themselves over to the raw power of the warp. These Psykers are teetering on the brink of complete damnation and being drawn into the thrall of dark and thirsting gods. Though it is fraught with risk and peril, the sheer power that can be achieved by opening oneself further to the possibility of the warp is immense. Like opening a crack in the casing of a blast furnace to realise the roaring inferno contained inside, the power of the Tainted Psyker is as awful as it is terrifying. Storms of psychic force, uncanny control of flesh, and terrible ways of using the power of the warp are the weapons the Tainted Psyker has bought, but at a cost most will ultimately come to regret.

The touch of the warp is corrosive and treacherous to even a trained mind, filled as it is with echoes of vast and malign intelligences and the rawness of warp power. By opening themselves to the wider possibilities of psychic power and the undiluted warp energy, free of any constraints imposed on them by the "small-minded", their minds begin to crumble, their bodies warped or crippled by the powers they are mediating. Many Psykers, once they begin down the tainted path to power, find themselves consumed by emotions and inclinations that they cannot control as the warp echoes and amplifies their dreams, obsessions, and fears. This warping process can end with monstrous madness on the part of the individual Psyker or one final fall to damnation and an eternity of service, or worse, to the Dark Gods.

The inherent and obvious dangers of cultivating the raw forces of creation themselves are well known to even middling agents of the Inquisition, and only the most radical Inquisitors would ever encourage their psychic Acolytes to embark on this baneful journey. To say nothing of the personal peril, which is itself already profoundly high, the danger it represents to those around the Tainted Psyker is even greater. With unfettered warp energy coursing through their very beings, Tainted Psykers who lose control or are overcome by the forces of the immaterium do so in a spectacular way. Rampant mutation, mass daemonic possession, mockery of the laws of reality, all are consequences lurking near the Tainted Psyker. Worst of all, suffused with such awesome and terrible psychic might, the Tainted Psyker may begin to lose sight of their true allegiances, and forsake the God-Emperor's truth for new and abominable deities that promise ever greater might.
### **Becoming a Tainted Psyker**
More of a diagnosis than a title, any Imperial Psyker willing to risk a fate far worse than death in exchange for greater psychic prowess can become a Tainted Psyker. All the character need do is willingly disregard the wise teachings of the Scholastica Psykana and draw greedily upon the power of the warp—it is as much of a state of mind as anything else. Once the character no longer views the warp as something to be kept at arm's length he becomes its thrall. The unending power promised is a seductive lure that provokes him to sink ever deeper into moral and physical corruption, pursuing arcane and malignant knowledge of warpcraft, sorcery, rituals, and all matters of other abominations. In time, nothing that gives the Tainted Psyker yet more strength to smite his foes and satisfy his desires is out of the question.

## **Templar Calix**

*"Will and blade, life and death, cause and consequence, mind and matter, soul's truth and warp's lie: all things indivisible and one."*

— Temple Calix Training Mantra.
### **Background**
Operating as a semi-autonomous organ of the Calixian Scholastica Psykana, the Psykana Temple Calix is an enigmatic and insular order of elite psyker-warriors, battle mystics devoted to personal skill at arms and the focusing of their psychic might and abilities to augment their power in close combat. To say that psykers who relish battle are unusual is an understatement in the extreme, and those who call themselves Templar Calix are a truly rare breed.

The Scholastica Psykana is made up clusters of sanctioned schools, methods and traditions that focus on the use of psychic power—it is this body that guides nascent psykers through the process of sanctioning, which, at least in theory, will give them enough control over their abilities to allow them to reintegrate with Imperial society. Although overseen and regulated by the Adeptus Astra Telepathica on Holy Terra, the Scholastica Psykana can vary greatly from sector to sector, both in their methods and in their philosophy. Within the Calixis Sector, there are many such branches. One of the smallest and most reclusive of are the Templars Calix, whose isolated temple-monastery is based in the polar wastelands of the sector capital of Scintilla. While several branches of the Scholastica focus on preparing sanctioned psykers for use alongside the armies of the Imperium in the battlefield, or their function as specialist advisers to military commanders, the Psykana Temple Calix focuses instead on developing the individual psyker's martial skill. The Templar Calix hones his mind and body together, becoming a deadly supernatural warrior who can vanquish his foes in a blaze of power and with the screaming edge of a force blade.

The traditions of the Templars Calix are as old as the Calixis Sector itself. Some say the first Templar was one of Angevin's closest advisers, a scion of a militant branch of the Scholastica originating in a distant part of Segmentum Solar. Others claim it was Drusus, the living saint, who founded the temple to provide him with specialist bodyguards after his near death on Maccabeus Quintus. No matter what their origin, the mystic training of the Templars Calix today focus on the use of their member's psychic ability in conjunction with deadly methods of close-quarter fighting. Personal loyalty to the Golden Throne, psyker-mysticism, self-discipline, and the fighting arts, both armed and unarmed, are drilled into the Templars. Their skills encompass brutally simple methods of killing an opponent and more elaborate manoeuvres commonly attributed only to assassins, as well as defensive techniques and practised agility. The use of all manner of exotic weapons is also taught, but the central focus of a Templar's training is the use of force weaponry, the psychoactive properties of which make these weapons extensions of the wielder's own power. In the hands of a Templar Calix, such a weapon becomes a channel for the destructive forces both of this world and beyond. Usually clothed in plain midnight-blue robes or the dark storm coats of the Adeptus Terra, when overt in displaying who and what they are, the Templars Calix wear close fitting cowled mantles of black samite and cover their visages with masks of tarnished silver to show blank and emotionless faces to the world.

The Templars Calix are few, even in comparison to the other orders of sanctionites in Calixis. Only a handful of psykers with physicality befitting a warrior also possess the necessary mental fortitude to be considered for sanctioning. Once graduated from the Scholastica Psykana even fewer would choose to expend their energies on martial proficiency and feats of arms instead of further developing their psychic abilities and turning them to more lucrative (and likely safer) ends. Among those in the know, however, the Psykana Temple Calix is a well-regarded organisation, and its Templars, of which perhaps a few dozen are minted every year, are in constant demand throughout the Sector. Military commanders, high ranking adepts, and even Rogue Traders prize the presence of a Templar as a bodyguard above nearly all others. Small units of Templars have been deployed as an elite assault force during some of the Sector's worst conflicts, but such actions are rare in the extreme. 

Unsurprisingly, the Inquisition—save for its Monodominants, anyway—considers the Templars Calix as extremely useful and capable agents, and there are more than a few Templar Acolytes within the ranks of the Calixian Conclave. It is something of an open secret that the Psykana Temple Calix is clandestinely funded by certain cabals within the Inquisition, and the current Grand Master of the Conclave, Lord Inquisitor Caidin, keeps a Templar Calix known as Shade, a virtuoso with a blade and a powerful telekinetic, in his personal retinue. The Monodominant sect, for its part, chafes against this relationship, and considers the Templars as little more than grossly overpaid mercenaries that are not to be trusted any more than "common" psykers (i.e. not at all).
#### **Becoming a Templar Calix**
The masters of the Psykana Temple Calix look primarily for candidates with a controlled, stable personality and psychic potential than pure strength at arms—the Temple's training can impart that, as long as the psyker has the proverbial "killer instinct". While those who learn of the Temple can travel to it and request to join the Templars, the Temple's close relationship with the Inquisition means psyker Acolytes are actually one of the Temple's main recruiting pipelines. When a psychic Acolyte's master detects such potential he is typically referred to the Temple for consideration, and if given their endorsement, will spend several months in intensive training to learn the ways of the Templars. 

This is a strenuous programme, tailored specifically to the unique psychology of the psyker's mind, and makes heavy use of hypno-indoctrination and psychic suggestion along with more conventional training methods. Once the candidate has completed training, but before he receives the title of Templar, he must acquire a force weapon of his own, the signature wargear of the Psykana Temple Calix. A particularly supportive Inquisitor might present his Acolyte with a force weapon as sort of a graduation gift, while those who stress the independence of their henchmen will trust the Templar-in-training to either procure or construct one themselves. Such an endeavour could form a small adventure that the other Acolytes could aid in if they desire.

**Required Career:** Imperial Psyker
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp)
**Other Requirements:** You must have no more than 10 Insanity Points and 10 Corruption Points. Upon reaching Rank 4 you must select the Savant Militant path.
**Martial Prowess:** Owing to the Temple's focus on skill at arms above intellectualism, at the point of becoming a Templar Calix, change the Imperial Psyker's Characteristic Advances as follows:

| **Characteristic** | **Simple** | **Intermediate** | **Trained** | **Expert** |
| ------------------ | :--------: | :--------------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| Weapon Skill       |    100     |       250        |     500     |    750     |

| Willpower          |    100     |       250        |     500     |    750     |
| Fellowship         |    500     |       750        |    1,000    |   2,500    |
Any Advances purchased for these Characteristics prior to taking the Alternate Career Rank still count towards the Characteristic's development. For example, if you have already bought a Simple Weapon Skill Advance, you still have only three further Advances possible for this Characteristic.

## **Tyrantine Shadow Agent**

*"Lest the truth devour all."*

— Memento Mori of Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos
### **Background**
The Inquisition, some say, is an empire of secrets. To outsiders, this is certainly the case, for in stern judgement and shrouded in mystery the Holy Ordos sit above them like wrathful gods, little understood and rightly feared. But what is not so widely known by outsiders is that there are many secrets the Inquisition keeps from its own, either because it is expedient to do so, or because they are simply too dangerous even for some members of the Ordos to know. These secrets are often held through invisible webs of patronage, fealty and alliance, but sometimes manifest themselves though shadow empires: whole organisations hidden under the wider umbrella of the Holy Ordos whose nature and concerns remain mysterious even to other Inquisitors and Acolytes.

Inside the Calixian Conclave, there is no greater divider than the Hereticus Tenebrae, more informally known as the Tyrant Star, and the Tyrantine Cabal is one such secretive and insular group striving to uncover the true nature of its menace. The supreme danger of the Star is not known to all even within the Inquisition’s own ranks. Even those who do know something rarely have anything but a piece of the puzzle, and there are many who dismiss the calamitous phenomena of the Tyrant Star as mere coincidence or superstitions. In no small part, the Tyrantine Cabal is responsible for maintaining this ignorance, just as much as it is investigating what the Hereticus Tenebrae represents and how to combat it.

As the years have progressed, this web of secrecy and control has taken on a life almost of its own, and methods and agencies have sprung up to support it and its master’s goals. One such powerful agency is the Tenebrae Collegium—a shadow empire all of its own founded by the cynical genius of the renowned Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. The Collegium takes the most promising and suitable of Acolytes and transforms them into subtle and lethal instruments of deception, whose true allegiances can remain secret even from the Inquisitors they serve. These Acolytes are perfectly suited to keeping the Tyrantine Cabal's purposes hidden and enacting its will without remorse or apprehension. The existence of the Collegium and its so-called “shadow agents” is a matter officially denied by the Cabal and the source of much secret debate, suspicion, and contentious enmity within the Conclave Calixis as a whole. How far does its reach stretch? How many agents does it have? And what darkness might go undiscovered lurking at the heart of such a strange and hidden power? Few know, but many outside the Cabal have grave misgivings, and it is entirely likely that its most entrenched detractors have fashioned their own secret networks to oppose the Tyrantines' scheming.

It is said Cassilda Cognos once quipped, in a moment of levity, that the Collegium “took outstanding dissemblers and accomplished liars and then began their work”. Certainly, the results of the Collegium’s conditioning do produce agents more than capable of moving through the Imperium in a carefully woven fog of falsity and misdirection. Using tiny gestures, key words and cadences, two agents can communicate vital information in the presence of others who remain none the wiser. Furthermore, using psychic and mental conditioning, a graduate of the Collegium can close his mind to all but the most destructive psychic probing, concealing his deepest secrets around a labyrinth of half truths and falsity to confuse, making them not only extraordinarily proficient spies and agents, but near-impregnable living vaults for the secrets of the Cabal.

The ultimate purpose of these Tyrantine agents is to firstly hold the Cabal above all other masters, to pursue knowledge of the Tyrant Star, and to keep that knowledge safe from all outside the Cabal’s covetous circle. In most cases, these goals coincide with the agent’s duties as Acolytes of the Ordos Calixis. However, where their true loyalties have come into conflict with the Adepta or even immediate superiors outside of the Cabal, this has led to cold and brutal conflict with those the agent would ordinarily call their lords, comrades, or even friends. So far, the Cabal has managed to keep all such “difficulties” from wider knowledge. The time may come, though, when the fate of all is at stake and they will have to act no matter what the cost. Perhaps a civil war will erupt within the Ordos Calixis as a result. This is a nightmare, however, that this secret empire, this order within an order, must bear, for their own fearful secrets are as nothing to the dangers of the Hereticus Tenebrae, and some must be sacrificed lest its truth devour all.
### **Becoming a Tyrantine Shadow Agent**
The path of the Tyrantine Shadow Agent is to be a spy among spies, his true loyalties hidden from his ostensible master. Shadow Agents are always vigilant for any new information about the Tyrant Star they can acquire, and then just as driven to jealously guard it from the prying eyes of those outside the Cabal. By default this demands the Shadow Agent conspire against the trust of his master and his fellow Acolytes, keeping his ultimate objectives hidden from any not deemed worthy of the Cabal's dread knowledge. An Acolyte being revealed as a Shadow Agent would face formal censure from their Inquisitor at best, and could suffer a far worse fate if their master is a more vindictive or covetous soul. For those who maintain their clandestine charge, however, loyal service to their true masters will in time reward them with ascension to the Cabal's inner ranks, and with it, the terrible insight of the threat posed by the Hereticus Tenebrae.

Taking this Alternate Career Rank is not just a matter of passing the xp requirements, it means that you have been singled-out by the Tyrantine Cabal to advance their hideously secretive ambitions. Advancing into this Career makes you a conspirator and subject to the Tyrantine Cabal’s secret orders and goals, and should only be selected if the contrivances of the Tyrant Star figure in to the development of your campaign. As always, consult with your GM and determine whether this Alternate Career Rank is appropriate.

**Required Career:** Any except Soroitas or Tech-Priest
**Alternate Rank:** Rank 5 or higher (3,000 xp)

## **Warp Dabbler**

*"She would have been just a petty recidivist and peddler of harm, one of countless souls of no great worth, but then the warp found her, and she became a true monster. However, as she is a monster loyal to me, you and I are now in conflict."*

— Radical Inquisitor Soldevan to Judge Hiram Fulk of the Adeptus Arbites
##### **Background**
Warp Dabblers, sometimes referred to as warplocks and petty sorcerers, are individuals tampering—often quite nesciently—with the malignant arts of the warp sorcery. Whether cultists, noncompliants, recidivists, or amoral academics, these individuals have had contact with forbidden knowledge and have decided to further explore the possibilities it can offer. These are not true sorcerers or savants of the forbidden, but instead are dark-hearted warriors, soiled enforcers, spiteful adepts, and twisted killers who have acquired a degree of warp lore and have made the perilous decision to put it into use for their own gain. Although they may never achieve the terrible heights of occult power and knowledge that the true masters of sorcery can, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing—especially in the hands of often-desperate individuals on the fringes of society.

Warp Dabblers may have walked almost any path before they begin their dalliance with warp craft. In the case of recidivists and other minor heretics, they may be cultists, criminals, smugglers, or even gang bosses. Others could, at least nominally, be on the straight and narrow, including lesser academics, occultists, and even noble scions. The intelligence and strength of will to study the forbidden is not something that all can do, but should one with the potential be presented with tantalisingly proscribed power, he will often seize it and put it to imaginative (and horrible) use.

Blessedly, the sorts of fell knowledge that could start one down the path of the Warp Dabbler are not easy to obtain. The Imperium is, in general, an insular and ignorant society, and this is just as much by design as it is by cultural norms. The Ecclesiarchy constantly preaches rhetoric designed to inspire dogmatic obedience and abject abhorrence of the heretical and the unknown in equal measure, while the Imperial Inquisition considers censoring and limiting the spread of information considered dangerous or corrupting an absolutely vital task. To the average Imperial citizen, a formal education in academic subjects is a luxury, daemons are distant horrors portrayed in morality plays, and the warp is more of an abstraction of antipathetic feelings than a very real place of unadulterated power and anarchy.

In this social climate, it is onerous to say the least to obtain texts or information about daemonology, the occult, and the immaterium, but it is by no means impossible either. There are few things more consistent in human nature than the desire to possess that which is proscribed or
unobtainable. In the darkest corners of Imperial society—and often its loftiest heights too—banned texts, forbidden tomes, and other instructions in warp craft can be bought, traded, and stolen by someone with the right connections or resources. Tragically, some even find their way into the hands of completely unwitting souls who, in a moment of weakness, turn away from the Ecclesiarchy's blessed ignorance and furtively turn the pages of madness and damnation.

It is an unfortunate irony that the Imperium’s tireless efforts to suppress perilous malefic knowledge mean those who do manage to obtain such information often have little real understanding of just how dangerous it can be. To them, the rituals and incantations are just another tool to obtain their goals, or worse, an amusing frivolity with the supernatural bearing no great significance at all. Only when it is far, far too late, and the leering eyes and grinning mouths of thirsting gods are upon him, does the average Warp Dabbler realise how profoundly his actions have doomed him.

This is not to say, however, that Warp Dabblers are not formidable foes. On the contrary, those who survive long enough, avoiding detection by the Imperial authorities and destruction or insanity from the dread tomes they ply, often possess a combination of low cunning, resourcefulness, and ruthless connivance which makes them quite competent adversaries. In addition, the warp-fueled powers and daemonic allies they can draw on makes them even more dangerous, especially when cornered or desperate. Warp Dabbling crime bosses may take down their rivals with horrors summoned from the warp, while assassins may use sorcery to pass unseen and so eliminate the most heavily guarded of targets with ease. Cultists may attract their followers with forbidden pleasures and dark rewards, while protecting their secrecy with hexes and malefic curses. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Warp Dabbler is thus a common quarry for servants of the Inquisition, a burgeoning moral threat who grows in power and danger every day he's left to further hone his hideous craft.

For Inquisitors of a more radical persuasion, cornering a Warp Dabbler who isn't already "too far gone" could be a profitable prospect. A Warp Dabbling Acolyte can call on his knowledge of the dark arts to defeat his opponents, gain a better understanding of their motives and operations, or even bend the powers of the warp against its own vile denizens when they manifest in the materium. When facing the prospect of execution, or worse, few Warp Dabblers would reject a radical Inquisitor's sanction to make something worthwhile of their lives, and with it, perhaps earn redemption in the eyes of the God-Emperor.
### **Becoming a Warp Dabbler**
An Acolyte requires both motive and opportunity to become a Warp Dabbler. At a minimum, the Acolyte must have a source from which he could acquire profane knowledge of the warp, along with the necessary moral flexibility to heedlessly study such subjects and their dire portents. The Acolyte’s Inquisitor might be a source of such possibility, as could contact with warp cults or forbidden tomes, perhaps made during the course of an investigation. Once the Acolyte chooses to dabble in the proscribed, he must spend an amount of time studying or being tutored—usually taking a few months, although a fast reader could conceivably do it quicker—during which time the Acolyte gains 2d10 Corruption Points.

Note that this Alternate Career Rank is intended to represent a more surface-level or casual understanding of the malignancy that is the warp. For Acolytes partaking in true academic study of the immaterium and what lies within, see the [Malefic Scholar](alternate%20career%20ranks.md#malefic%20scholar) Alternate Career Rank.
