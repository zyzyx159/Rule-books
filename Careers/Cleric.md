*"By the Saints and the Sigillite himself! If you don't move, I'll take this hammer to your head!"*

— Preacher Silon Constantine, Fenksworld.

Clerics are the priests of the Emperor, members of the Adeptus Ministorum, better known as the
Ecclesiarchy. As benefactors of this vast and powerful organisation, clerics are a diverse lot and can turn their hand to just about anything. A capable combatant that can hold their own in a fight, a shrewd leader who inspires their fellows to great acts of piety and bravery, or an introspective scholar of the Imperial Cult and its place in society, the only constant between clerics is their unwavering faith in the Master of Mankind.

## **Novice Advances**

*"Do you think Saint Thrastus complained when he was strung up by his petard? No! Not one word! That's piety. Now get on with your work, you little ingrate."*

Novices serve the Ecclesiarchy body and soul, looking to the examples of the Imperial saints to inspire acts of greatness. They also serve those higher than them selves in the Ecclesiarchy (which is quite a few people indeed).

*"You hold within you the Emperor's own truth! Never forget we are right and they are wrong!"*

A Preacher learns to lead men, to inspire and guide mankind, and to drive the word of the Ecclesiarchy home—upon the teeth of an eviscerator if need be.
