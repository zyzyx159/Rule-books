*"We go in, kill anything that moves and then blow the structure with a demo charge."*

— Eli Plex, Assault Veteran of the Secondus 21st.

Soldier, fighter, man-at-arms, warrior, or heavy, those who fight for a living are all considered Guardsmen. Some may be members of a formal army, such as a Planetary Defence Force (PDF), or even the Imperial Guard itself, from which this Career Path gets its name. Just as easily, a Guardsman might be a mercenary for hire, a member of a noble’s household troops, or a even just a thug that’s thrown in with the local gangers for the simple pleasure of bashing skulls open on the rockcrete. Your typical Guardsman isn’t particularly good at navigating social intrigue or academic pursuits, but their mastery of weapons and ability to control the flow of combat (read: make things die in loud and violent ways) is second to none.

## **Conscript Advances**

*"If they can bleed and run, they can hold a gun."*

## **Storm Trooper Advances**

*"Storm troopers? Them Throne-groaning glory boys get all the prime action—and all the credit, too. Don't listen to the propaganda—it's us regular Guard that does all the grit-work."*

Storm Troopers create utter destruction. Often regarded by the regular Guard as vain parade apes, they nonetheless have a well-deserved reputation for being the best of the best.

## **Commander Advances**

*"Men of the Imperium stand tall, for you are the favoured of the Emperor!"*

Commanders control the entire flow of battle, from planning to execution. Imperial Commanders have at their disposal the greatest armies in the known galaxy, and the cold, hard determination to use them.

## **Sniper Advances**

*"There's something really satisfying about making a man's head explode like a blood melon. All in the name of the Emperor of course."*

Snipers are masters of their art, able to kill at a distance, then melt away from view. They are silent, skilled and often have a grim sense of humour. Many find them hard to understand.
