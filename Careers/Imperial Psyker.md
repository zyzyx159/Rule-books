*"Imagine knowing there was a door to the realm of Daemons, and the slightest inattention on your behalf would see them batter it down and rip you to shreds. Now imagine that door is inside your head. That's what being a psyker is like."* — Castus Lupa, Savant Adjunct.

Psykers are otherwordly individuals with supernatural powers and can possess a wide array of varied abilities, from reading minds to throwing bolts of flame. The power to bend reality to one’s will comes with a terrible price, however: each psyker’s mind is a doorway to the hellish dimension of the immaterium, the realm of Daemons, psychic predators and other indescribable horrors. Imperial psykers have undergone Sanctioning, giving them a measure of control over their psychic powers; nevertheless, one still risks his soul each time he uses his unnatural abilities.

## **Scholar Obscurus Advances**

*"You talk to him, but he don't answer. You can feel him rummagin' in your thoughts right enough though. Put me off my gruel, it can."*

Abandoning the petty realm of human knowledge, the Scholar Obscurus studies the wisdom and folly of the human spirit. Steeped in forgotten lore and constantly muttering catechisms and charms against the creatures of the warp, these psykers grow strange and distant.

## **Scholar Empyrean Advances**

*"Sire, success! He made three pounds of gold yesterday! Funny fish though, didn't look happy or nothing, just wanted be left to his proper studies—whatever that means."*

The mind of the Scholar Empyrean ranges free, even whilst their will is securely chained to the immeasurable protection of the Emperor's own soul. Studying the deepest mysteries of psychic ability, the Scholar Empyrean care little for worldly goods or the petty demands of the corpus.
