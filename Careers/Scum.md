*"You see, you've won again. I told you I was no good at cards. I'll play one more round, but only because you insist."* 
— Reetheus Orl, Barking Saint, Hive Sibellius.

Scum are the criminals, outcasts, conmen, gangers, thieves, and desperados of the Imperium. It is easy to generalise scum as the hardened recidivist that terrorizes honest citizens in less-affluent parts of hive cities, or the destitute beggar stinking up the porch of the local refectory – mankind’s misbegotten flotsam and jetsam. Truthfully, though, scum includes just about anyone that exists outside or on the fringes of Imperial society. Born survivors that, by nature, must be both skillful and secretive, scum can lend a hand to almost any situation. Of course, scum are perfectly capable of using violence to get what they desire, although most are somewhat “glass-jawed” and would rather connive than shoot their way out of perilous situations.

## **Dreg Advances**

*"Don't look at the dreg, Tarquis, you'll only encourage them."*

Beggars, thieves and base born scum: the dregs of society are nevertheless hardy and surprisingly capable.

## **Outlaw Advances**

*"Hanging's too good fer 'em. Thrown him to the razehounds! See how he steals with his fingers bit off!"*

A wary creature of questionable, if any, morals, the Outlaw has learnt to fight and run away, to better thieve another day. If society will not provide for them, they are happy to take what they need to survive and law be damned.

Savvy and brutal, Stubjacks specialise in ambush, robbery and turf war. Some lead gangs, others operate alone, but in all cases Stubjacks use strength, cunning and intimidating weapons to get what they want.

## **Gang Lord Advances**

*"The Robber-Monk they calls him, sleek as silver, twice as quick. Could steal your shadow while you're blinking, so they say. The Spire nobs are quaking in their boots. You mark my muzzle, there's more than one family safe that'll be cracked tonight!"*

The Gang Lord is skilled in high-stakes operations, from assassination to cat burglary and data-heists. He can put together a crew, or simply awe the local underworld with his low cunning and high returns.
