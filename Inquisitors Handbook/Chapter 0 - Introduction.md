# Introduction

The universe is imperiled by aggressive xenos, the unclean heretic, Daemons of the warp, and countless other threats, and standing against these many and varied horrors are the agents of the Inquisition, bold souls who have been selected for their talents, their skills and their loyalty to the Golden Throne. Yet even with these assets, these Acolytes stand little chance against the tide of doom that looms large over the demesne of God-Emperor without the proper training and tools, and even when so properly prepared, only a rare few of these blessed servants rise above the rest to claim their place alongside the Imperium's greatest heroes. 

The Inquisitor's Handbook is your indispensable guide to surviving the perils of the 41st Millennium. Functioning as a rules and setting expansion, this source book explores all the dynamics that make up the Acolyte, offering new options, new weapons, armor and gear all to ensure that the servants of the God-Emperor are properly prepared before embarking on their mission into the belly of corruption in search of the witch, the heretic and xeno.

This source book opens with a broad range of character creation options that include new origins, ranks, and a new career path to expand the choices available to players and to ensure that each Acolyte is a unique member of the retinue, bringing to bear a useful assortment of tools to aid in any investigation. Scattered throughout the first two chapters is further setting information, revealing more of the Calixis Sector and the dangers arrayed against it. Characters generated using these rules are every bit as capable as those in Dark Heresy, but offer even more firepower to established groups of investigators.

The book unfolds to take a broader look at the Calixis Sector itself, exploring the multitude of worlds through the lens of broad archetypes. Each chapter deals with a different sort of planet, ranging from the savage feral and feudal worlds to the labyrinthine hive worlds. Within these chapters are expansions for weapons, armor and general gear, all of which are tailored to the worlds that produce them, giving Player Characters more choices for armaments while also reflecting the idiosyncrasies of characters that hail from particular planets or spacecraft.

Following the world entries, the weapons and gear of the Holy Ordos are examined and the book then explores the religious side of the 41st Millennium, revealing secrets of the God-Emperor's cult and the sects that make up His diverse following. This chapter also shapes the role of the Acolyte within the larger body of God-Emperor's servants, while simultaneously offering in-game hooks to bind the characters more firmly to the setting.

Finally, the *Inquisitor's Handbook* examines life as an Acolyte, demonstrating the political intricacies of serving an Inquisitor, while offering rules expansions for using Skills in new and interesting ways. Any player looking for an edge against the endless enemies of the Imperium would do well to become familiar with this chapter.

## Weapon Training Talents

This book contains scores of new kinds of weapons, from slender stilettos to mighty assault cannons. All of these new weapons, however, are categorized into the same broad weapon types from Dark Heresy. So for instance, an Acolyte with the Basic Weapon Training (SP) talent will be able to use any of the Basic Solid Projectile weapons listed in this book.
## Weapon Statistics

All of the weapons listed in this book use the following statistics.
### Name
What the weapon is called.
### Class
Describes what class the weapon is, either a Melee, Thrown, Pistol, Basic or Heavy weapon.
#### Melee
Melee weapons can be used in close combat. When using a Melee weapon you add your SB to the Damage you inflict.
#### Thrown
Thrown weapons cover anything propelled by muscle power alone and covers knives, axes, spears and such like. Unless they are also classed as Melee, Thrown weapons cannot be used in close combat (or if they do they count as Improvised weapons). When using a Thrown weapon you add your SB to the Damage you inflict (with the exception of explosives such as grenades).
#### Pistol
Pistol weapons are fired one handed and can be used in close combat. However, when a Pistol is used in close combat, the firer gains no bonuses or penalties to hit for range or targeting equipment.
#### Basic
Basic weapons normally require two hands but can be used one handed with a –20 penalty to hit.
#### Heavy
Heavy weapons always require two hands and must be braced in someway, usually either on a bipod or tripod, but also on a windowsill or sandbag (or on the firer's shoulder in the case of RPG launchers), to be fired without penalties. Firing a Heavy weapon without bracing incurs a –30 penalty to hit and prohibits Semi-Automatic and Full Automatic fire.
### Range
This number is used to determine how far the weapon can be accurately fired in meters. A weapon's Short Range is half this number while its Long Range is double this number (for ranged bonuses and penalties see page 198 in Dark Heresy). Weapons cannot be fired at targets over four times their range.
### RoF (Rate of Fire)
Tells you if the weapon can be fired either on Semi-Automatic or Full Automatic and how many rounds/charges it expends when doing so. A weapon's RoF has three entries to indicate the modes a weapon can be fired in. The first entry indicates whether the weapon can be fired singly (with an S). The second entry indicates whether or not a weapon can be fired semi-automatically and the number listed describes the number of shots fired. Finally, the third entry describes if the weapon can be fired on full automatic. Any mode in which the weapon cannot be fired is indicated with a "–".

Some weapons can be fired in more than one mode. If this is the case each of its different Rates of Fire will be listed in its profile. Characters must choose which mode they are firing their weapon in before making their attack.
### Dam (Damage)
The Damage the weapon does and the type of Damage it inflicts for the purpose of Criticals (as shown in brackets): (E) Energy, (X) Explosive, (R) Rending, (I) Impact.
### Pen (Penetration)
Reflects how good the weapon is at going through armour. When a shot from this weapon hits a target, reduce the target's Armour by the weapon's Penetration, with results of less than 0 counting as 0 (i.e. the armour provides no protection at all). Then work out Damage as normal. So, for example, if a weapon with a Penetration of 3 hits a target with 5 points of Armour, the target will only count as having 2 points of Armour against any Damage the hit causes. Note that Penetration has no effect on fields, but it does affect cover.
### Clip
How many rounds/charges the weapon holds when fully loaded.
### Rld (Reload)
How many Actions the weapon takes to Reload. This is generally Half (for a Half Action) or Full (for a Full Action), though can take a number of Actions over several Rounds.
### Special
This tells you if the weapon has any Special Qualities, such as creating a blast when fired or needing to recharge between shots.
### Wt (Weight)
Represents how much the weapon weighs.
### Cost
Indicates the standard value of the weapon within the Imperium. Cost is always represented in Thrones.
### Availability
This identifies the weapon's Availability (see Availability on page 125 in Dark Heresy).
