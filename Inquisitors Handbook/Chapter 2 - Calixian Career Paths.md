# Chapter II: Calixian Career Paths 

*"What is the self compared to the God-Emperor's service? Nothing."*

— Commissar Abdelus XXII.

Dark Heresy provides a solid overview of the various sorts of people the Inquisition might recruit in their efforts to uncover heresy and defeat the alien. Divided into broad archetypes called Career Paths, players might take on the roles of Guardsmen, bring to their Inquisitor expertise with a dizzying assortment of weaponry, psykers armed with strange and disturbing powers, or everything in between. While each Career Path brings with it a set of expectations and game functions, a character is much more than "just" an Assassin or "just" Scum. Even though classified as being a member of such a Career Path, characters have a lot of room for customization, definition, and, above all, individuality. This chapter expands on the options available to Player Characters by offering an additional Career Path for characters of the Schola Progenium origin, while offering specific variations on Career Paths for characters hailing from and exploring the Calixis Sector.

**"A heretic may see the truth and seek redemption. He may be forgiven his past and will be absolved in death. A traitor will never find peace in this world or next. There is nothing as wretched or as hated in all the world as a traitor."**

## Modifying Existing Careers

The remainder of this chapter trains its attention on Dark Heresy's Career Path system by expanding your options to offer more flexibility and individualization through the use of Alternate Career Ranks and Elite Advances. Both options, as they are expressed here, are firmly rooted in the power groups, organisations and worlds of the Calixis Sector, and many build on the new options found in the Expanded Character Generation system described in Chapter I. Although these options do offer exciting choices and provide impetus for great role playing, many carry serious side effects. As with any new material, be sure to gain your GMs permission before investing in one of these options. T

### **Alternate Career Ranks**

The following section details a number of Ranks that may be taken during your character's career progression as alternatives to the normal path of their Career. In many ways these Alternate Ranks change your character's potential abilities and direction but not their fundamental nature: you won't swap Career Paths, but rather your character's fate simply takes an unusual detour along the way.

These Alternate Career Paths serve two functions: the first is to offer you an opportunity to personalize your character and make him or her something unique and special. The second is to give characters a very definite place within the setting, a role amongst the powers and intrigues of the Calixis Sector. As the astute among you will notice, each Alternate Rank is firmly grounded in a particular conspiracy, organisation or even cult.

#### **Taking an Alternate Rank**

Alternate Ranks are attractive and for good reason. Gaining new powers, Skills and Talents, and giving you more tools to distinguish your character from others of your path are all excellent reasons for acquiring an Alternate Rank. To select an Alternate Rank, you must first secure your GMs permission. Several of the Alternate Ranks may complicate matters and be at odds with an existing plot line or campaign. Second, most Alternate Ranks include one or more prerequisites, which you must fulfill before taking the Rank. Finally, Alternate Ranks have a minimum level at which they can be taken by the character (and some can be taken by more than one Career Path). The Rank can be taken at this minimum Rank or at any Rank thereafter.

Once you've met all of the requirements and your GM agrees, you may select the Alternate Rank. In every case, the Alternate Rank is "swapped" for the Rank you would otherwise have taken and its Advance Scheme is exchanged for the one found in your Career's normal path. From this point onward, you have access to these Advances and may spend your xp freely on them. The Rank may also indicate some unique ability or Trait that is gained as well—apply these immediately.

#### Titles and Authority within the Holy Ordos

The Inquisition is an ancient and arcane organisation made up of shifting webs of patronage, influence and power. Although titles and epithets may be awarded or simply come about naturally for individuals within the Ordos, it actually possesses few hard-cut ranks of authority. The highest is that of Inquisitor Lord, of which any sector might have only a dozen (and often less) at any one time. Below them are the Inquisitors ordinary. They are the principle agents of the Inquisition and they each hold the same notional full authority of the Holy Ordos in temporal power and influence within their own number , but in practice can differ greatly . Beneath them, and far outnumbering them, are the Acolytes, each of whom may one day aspire to higher office and may be referred to depending on their master's whims as interrogators (a title usually reserved for those senior agents headed for a rosette themselves), specialists, savants, explicators, throne agents or, more likely, simply as Acolytes.

As well as offering up a slew of new abilities and potentials, taking an Alternate Rank, "the path less travelled" so to speak, has its downsides. You may (and probably will) miss out on certain Skills and Talents, have your maximum ability with certain Skills capped-out early, or be forced to pay more xp for them. This is simply the price of diversifying your character into a new and specialised area. Your GM may allow you to still pick these missed Advancements, if appropriate, but as Elite Advances (see Elite Advances from Missed Career Ranks) during your next Career Rank.

Because taking an Alternate Rank complicates the character progression system somewhat, it is recommended for experienced players. Remember, though, that regardless of how many options you have, a finite number of xp caps your progress and this is what determines your character's Rank.

#### **Example**

*Junt Yeager, a Guardsman character takes the Alternate Rank Malfian Bloodsworn, exchanging his usual Rank 5: Veteran for Rank 5: Bloodsworn, and fulfils the requirements listed. He doesn't cease to be a Guardsman; he is just now a Guardsman who sidelines as a murderous bounty hunter. Junt's player now has access to the Skills and Talents listed under the Bloodsworn Advances at the costs listed there, and may spend xp freely on them from this point forward. However, all this time gallivanting around bringing down recidivists for money means he misses out on certain opportunities from Guardsmen Rank 5: Veteran. When he moves onto Guardsman Rank: 6, if he wishes to still obtain these (and has the xp to spend), he must pay for them as Elite Advances.*

#### **Moving On**

Once you have accumulated and spent enough xp to advance to the next Rank, you do so as normally. If your Career Path splits, you must choose one path as you normally would, your Alternate Rank standing in the stead of any previous choice you needed to have made. You must then follow this chosen path normally, although you may find your "tangent" has left you missing certain Skills needed as prerequisites for some of the Advances offered by the new Rank and, to acquire them, you must obtain them as Elite Advances. More likely, however, you will continue to develop your Advances from your Alternate Rank to make up for missed opportunities.

#### **Elite Advances from Missed Career Ranks**

Having taken an Alternate Rank means that your character has deviated from the regular path and, while the character will have gained new and often unique abilities from this extra-curricular activity, he misses out on what would have been his regular development. In this case, the "missed" Talents and Skills can be obtained by the character (with the GMs approval) as Elite Advances for their listed cost in the missed Rank plus 50 xp.

#### **Example**

*Junt the Guardsman missed out on Guardsman Rank: 5 Veteran, having become a Bloodsworn bounty hunter instead. However, Junt obtained a melta gun during the course of an encounter with some hereteks and would like to become proficient in its use. Basic Weapon Training (Melta) is an Advance listed on his missing Rank, so Junt's player asks to take this as an Elite Advance. The GM agrees on the condition that the character spends sufficient downtime between adventures practicing, and allows Junt to have the Advance for 150 xp (100 for the Talent plus 50 more for the Elite Advance). The GM also charges him a chunk of Throne gelt for the cost of the ammo bottles he's used up training with the hand-cooker!*

## **Black Priest of Maccabeus**

*"I walk in the footsteps of the Blessed Saint Drusus and I go about the Emperor's work. At my word the unclean spirit baulks and the heretic withers in shame. Who, then, are you to stand against me?"*

— Prior Cornelius Agrippa, Maccabean Exorcist.

Known by some as the Black Clerics or the Ashen Confessors (and in secret by the more fearful nickname of "pyre-crows"), these clerics form loose-knit orders of militant priests organised at the behest of Ordo Malleus to aid them in their work. Such orders are scattered through Imperial space and, although far from common, are a tried and tested weapon in Ordo Malleus's arsenal. In the Calixis Sector, the Inquisition chose to base their Black Order on Maccabeus Quintus, an often overlooked shrine world and home to a particularly aesthetic and mystical interpretation of the Imperial Creed. It is also a world removed from the intrigues and power struggles of the sector's Ecclesiarchy politics and, therefore, perfect for their needs.

Black Priests are selected from promising candidates taken from the Ministorum's clergy and chosen for their strength of will, the power of their faith and, in many cases, by dint of survival when confronted by malefic forces in the past. The candidates are then subject to extreme levels of testing and interrogation as if they themselves where suspected heretics, a process some do not survive; those that come through this trial are trained in secret esoteric lore by their masters in Ordo Malleus. Entrusted with knowledge otherwise forbidden, even to others of the Ecclesiarchy, and taught how to focus their will and the purity of their faith to achieve extraordinary things, not least of all the castigation of Daemons, clerics who undergo the "Maccabean rites" are forever changed by the experience, and set apart from their fellows in the Ministorum by the nature of their faith and the dark and secret truths about the nature of reality they now carry. The road of a Black Priest is a hard one and rarely one long-lived, not simply because of the weight of the knowledge they carry, but because they are driven by their calling into the most dangerous of situations against the worst of foes. Most Black Priests find service with the Inquisition either in the direct retinue of a Daemon hunter, or as a specialist Acolyte operating for another Ordo, ready to bring their abilities to bear when the Daemonic is unexpectedly encountered. Should a Black Priest live long enough, it is not uncommon for them to rise to the rank of an Inquisitor Malleus themselves, if they are capable enough.

In appearance and demeanour, Maccabean Black Priests live up to their name, dressing in simple black or ashen robes, and eschewing any form of ornamentation or extravagance of appearance other than religious icons and relics—often rendered in simple iron or steel. Likewise weapons and armour are likely to be blackened with pyre ash and their manner is likely to be grim, unforgiving and humourless (although a bleak gallows wit is evident in some). They are fanatics in their cause, but, unlike the firebrand ranting of a Redemptionist, their zealotry often has the quality of cold unyielding stone and dire certainty.

#### **Becoming a Black Priest of Maccabeus**

In order to qualify for this path, the character must be a Cleric who either originates from Maccabeus Quintus, or with the permission (or at the behest) of their Inquisitorial masters is sent to train there during "downtime" between adventures. This Career Path is particularly suited to Clerics who want a more directly combative role against the powers of the warp, or who in their character's past have survived encounters with the Daemonic.

**Required Career:** Cleric.

**Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must have less than 10 Corruption Points when this career is taken. Also, you must either originate or have spent time training on Maccabeus Quintus. Note this career is not open to characters with the Mind Cleansed Origin.

#### **Special: Encarta Maleficarum (Elite Advance)**

Some Black Priests, in order to aid them as holy exorcists, are subjected to a secret ritual that Ordo Malleus calls the Encarta Maleficarum. During this ritual, forbidden knowledge is burned deep into their minds, shackled with wards inscribed by occult means directly into the cerebral cortex. This procedure rare and considered a radical one even by the most ardent of Daemonhunters, as the survival rate is not high and, even if successful, the recipient's life expectancy can be seriously reduced and their sanity eroded.

The Encarta Maleficarum is treated as an Elite Advance (see page 229 of Dark Heresy). Upon spending the xp to acquire it, your character disappears for 1d5 weeks, as the Black Priests put your faith and endurance to the test and inscribe burning lore into your mind. As a result of this procedure's harmful side effects, you gain 1d5 Insanity Points and you permanently reduce your Toughness by 1d5 and your Fellowship by 1d5.

This heavy price buys fearful knowledge and armours you against the whiles of the Daemon: your character gains the Forbidden Lore (Ordo Malleus) skill and the Insanely Faithful talent. Also you gain a +10 bonus on all Tests made to resist torture and interrogation, attempts to read or control your mind and any form of possession. In addition, if an attempt to possess you does succeed, but by less than three degrees of success, the assault or intrusion is blocked by the wards within your mind—it fails and you collapse in a catatonic state for 1d10 minutes.

## **Bonded Emissary** 

*"My masters regret that your harvest has failed governor and unrest stirs your little world. Perhaps you should seek assistance from the free captains as you did three years ago when you turned down our last generous offer, and with it the protection of our friendship… no? Well, unfortunately things have grown harsher in the sub-sector of late and our price now is regrettably somewhat higher…"*

— Adept-Assayer Alisha Zhou, Emissary of the Machenko Dynasty.

Travel is a hazardous business, and foolish is the man or woman who steps unwary of the dangers away from the safety of their own, let alone seeks to travel the cold and merciless darkness between the stars. Such travel in some ways is an even more dangerous business for the powerful and wealthy of the Calixis Sector's elites, because, although insulated by their power and their followers from commonplace hardships, they often have many enemies and much to lose. The Imperium of man is a grim and deadly place; the great and the powerful must always fear the assassin's hand, as well as the intrigues, plots and machinations of their rivals. It is unsurprising that many choose to remain at the centre of their domains and, when matters of import arise that do not require their personal presence, they send others out in their stead. The Bonded Emissary is just such a person. Emissaries are, by their nature, powerful individuals, no mere messenger, trade factor or errand-runner. An Emissary speaks with their master's voice and carries with them their master's authority (to a point). Such a trusted and delicate position requires much from the individual involved, as they must be above all, clever, socially adept and strong-willed. They must also have a mastery of the facts at hand and be aware of the subtle interplay of politics, while being wary always for the manoeuvring and plotting of their master's rivals. Some Emissaries focus on the skills of the diplomat and the negotiator, while others act mainly as agents to evaluate and acquire objects, opportunities and even people who their masters might wish to recruit. Successful Emissaries soon become recognised and valued, and win favour and power in their own right. Those that fail their employers abjectly or cause them to lose face seldom get a second chance.

In the Calixis Sector, as in much of the Imperium, Emissaries go by numerous names and titles depending on their task and their master. The Administratum has a labyrinthine series of titles and designations, from the Quastor Maximus who sits in attendance at the Lucid Palace, to the grey ranks of reeves, delagators, potentates and the innumerable sub-consuls, consuls lesser and peripatetic that shuttle between its concerns and the other branches of the Adeptus Terra and Commercia. The great trade guilds and trans-stellar cartels, such as the Skaelen-Har Hegemony and the DeVayne Corporation, have their brokers, agents and procurators to represent them. The noble houses of Scintilla, Malfi and the other major worlds have their own heralds and nuncios, and upand-coming scions that provide them with ambassadors and who maintain their presence at court. The various powers and domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus also largely depend on Emissaries chosen from the ranks of their tech-priests to interact with the wider Imperium, whose "petty" concerns and intrigues as they see them hold little interest for the Magos. The tech-priests themselves, are largely the source of some not unjustified fear, misunderstanding, and apprehension by others, and in order to overcome this difficulty and secure their desired outcomes, the ordered minds of the Mechanicus will engage a specialist to act for them.

#### **Becoming a Bonded Emissary**

Inquisitors have need of skilled individuals other than trained killers, mind-bending psykers, and dogged investigators. They often need liars and dissemblers, individuals whose perception allows them to read the subtle ebb and flow of the interplay of a noble's court, and men and women who can detect the subtle taint of madness beneath a genial façade. Emissaries are perfect for such tasks, and an Acolyte with these skills can be confidently relied upon to act as the cornerstone of any covert investigation, often with the backing of false identities and cover provided by the Holy Ordos. Those that meet them, while in one of their cover identities, rarely guess their true master unless they decide to reveal it.

**Required Career:** Adept or Tech-Priest. **Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp). **Other requirements:** Intelligence 30 and Fellowship 30.

## **Calixian Xeno-Arcanist**

*"Yes, you were right to call me in Lord Marshal. The runic symbols are indeed of xeno-origin, yes the dying ones… but the inscription is not in their usual form… this rune here, for example, does indicate a warning, but not against trespass as one might expect but… oh… I say…. ahem, I must consult some texts, erm, off world, very important—if my passage could be arranged quickly… perhaps now?"*

— Xeno-Arcanist Xoth Lyncarte, Prior to the loss of expedition: Seedworld-Gamma-9.

A specialised scholar in both a privileged and a dangerous position, a Xeno-Arcanist specialises in obscure lore and knowledge concerning the works of the alien. There are few sources for such knowledge, but among them are the Rogue Trader families, the explorators, and the annals of Imperial History itself, which are rife with stories of war against the aliens that have surrounded and beset mankind since time immemorial. The most exhaustive and prohibited records, however, reside in the archive of the Holy Inquisition itself and the vaults of Ordo Xenos Calixis, whose remit extends out to the very edge of explored space. These contain a veritable treasure trove of terrible knowledge and perilous artefacts from alien races known, unknown and, in some cases, deemed to be so dangerous that even use of their names is forbidden on pain of death. Such a vast wealth of fragmentary, disparate and often contradictory knowledge requires both skill and vast insight to organise and apply. For this reason, Xeno-Arcanists Acolytes are considered a necessary evil by Ordo Xenos, although, always the subject of the closest scrutiny less they succumb to the foul temptations of the alien. Some serve as cloistered academics and savants, while others are utilised as agents in the field to put their skills to more practical (if perilous) applications.

Outside the Holy Inquisition, Xeno-Arcanists hold a far more precarious position and must often conceal their knowledge to avoid persecution. Many are driven academics whose lust for knowledge outstrips any misgivings about their ultimate fate, while other Radicals believe that by studying the alien they can better learn to defeat it, or even replicate alien technology and achievements for their own ends. Some, blinded by the potential discoveries and benefits involved, are foolish enough to secretly disbelieve the Imperial doctrine that the xenos and their works are fundamentally evil. Some even live long enough to regret this misplaced conceit.

The Calixis Sector, bounded as it is by the vast and terrifying expanse of unknown space, is a place where knowledge of the alien is in high (if secret) demand, with many mercantile guilds, explorers and even noble houses, quietly circumventing the Imperium's ban on such knowledge either through desire for profit, power, out of fear or simple, damnable curiosity. To the chagrin of Ordo Xenos, by simple virtue of the sector's location, time and exposure, many private libraries and collections on Scintilla, Malfi and other established worlds are known to hold their own xenos artefacts and secret lore although often useless or forgotten without the knowledge of how to interpret them. The Hetaireia Lexis's collections have been the source of several scandals and even a few armed raids in the past. Unsurprisingly then, a rogue Xeno-Arcanist can charge a high price for their expertise if they are willing to enter such a dangerous game. Many do so with their own agendas, some not realising until too late the true nature of those they find themselves working for.

#### **Becoming a Xeno-Arcanist**

Becoming a Xeno-Arcanist is more a matter of inclination and opportunity than anything else. Conceivably any adept in the service of the Inquisition could be tasked or driven to study the alien, particularly if, in the past, they have encountered the xenos themselves or acted as curator for xeno-lore or artefacts. This is particularly the case of adepts in the service of Inquisitors from Ordo Xenos, for whom the pursuit of the alien and the destruction of those who have truck with their works is their central quest.

**Required Career:** Adept. **Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp). **Other Requirements:** Intelligence 40.

## **Chaliced Commissariat Operative** 

*"They have nothing to fear—unless they have something to fear."*

— Common saying amongst the Chaliced Commissariat.

Those who move close to those circles of power at the Lucid Palace on Scintilla, or with enough resource to pay to hear the talk of the court, know that Lord Sector Marius Hax is a savagely ambitious and paranoid figure. He despises rebels with a malice and a hatred that borders on outright madness. His determination to maintain the glorious and obedient dominion of the Emperor in the Calixis Sector—under his name of course—is worth to him any bloodshed or terror. As a man, subtle and clever, as well as brutal, since attaining his high rank, he has forged many tools to tighten his control over the sector and some have been more successful than others. One of those tools, whose success has been mixed, is the Chaliced Commissariat.

This special military unit is a direct political and military extension of the Lord Sector's will and was created to maintain direct control over locally raised regiments and PDF forces within the Calixis Sector. Feared and hated in equal measure across the sector, the mere sight of the laurel-wreathed chalice badge and deep red rank insignia are enough cause for a defence trooper to blanch and consider whether their life has come to an end.

Though Hax can see many ways in which rebellion might occur in his domain, what most concerns him is corruption among local PDF units, or worse an organised and armed secession on the part of a local planetary government, supported by its planetary defence force. The Imperium's history is littered with such revolts and Hax is not willing to let the Imperial governance in Calixis, or his personal reputation, be muddied by such occurrences. To this end, he commissioned the raising of a special military formation, modelled on the Imperial Commissariat that would draw suitable recruits from across the sector, selected for their loyalty, ambition and willingness to use any means necessary to ensure order. They would be charged with maintaining the morale and loyalty of PDF units across the sector, rooting out criminality and corruption, and ensuring that whatever local loyalties might exist, fear would override them if need be. Such "internal security commissariats" are far from unknown in the Imperium, particularly on larger hive worlds where the PDF may maintain potentially millions of men at arms, but the powers, remit and sheer brutality of Hax's force is certainly unusual, and has caused controversy and dispute among the sector's powerful elites.

Lord Marshal Gorman of the Adeptus Arbites has made no secret of his dislike for Hax's "specially selected scum", seeing them as bordering on being an unlawful agency, and therefore one step away from an instrument of rebellion themselves. The powers of the Malfian sub-sector and the notoriously independent Fenksworld always managed to keep their own PDF forces largely free of involvement through means both fair and foul. The greatest conflict, however, has come from the true Commissariat, the arm of the Adeptus Munitorium charged with maintaining morale and order in the Imperial Guard, and whose contempt for the Chaliced forces has never been disguised. This dislike blossomed into open conflict during the Tranch Uprising when a Chaliced Commissariat unit executed an Imperial Guard detachment that retreated from their post. The senior Imperial Commissar in-theatre decreed that the Chaliced Commissariat had no authority over Imperial Guard units, and in executing the "deserters", they had committed traitorous mass-murder against the Emperor's lawful forces. On the basis of this judgement, he had every member of the Chaliced Commissariat on Tranch shot.

Since the affair on Tranch, the true Commissariat have kept the Chaliced forces from operating in active war zones to any extent—much to Hax's displeasure. To avoid further embarrassment, the Chaliced Commissariat has confined itself largely to operations within the garrisons of the Calixis Sector's core worlds and lending themselves to "policing actions" against Hax's political enemies or brutal crackdowns at the slightest provocation. It is not unknown for a PDF base to be isolated, its officers interrogated and executed and all lower ranks to be shipped off to the Ghostfire-fuelled penal legions on the basis of the merest rumour of sedition.

#### **Becoming a Soldier of the Chaliced Commissariat**

Members of the Chaliced Commissariat are not only soldiers, but ruthless figures of authority and fear within the Calixis Sector, particular on the core worlds surrounding Scintilla. This alone may make the recruitment of a member of the Commissariat attractive to an Inquisitor in need of a ruthless military-trained Acolyte. Members of the Commissariat also move freely around the sector in the execution of their duties and have access to intelligence sources regarding political and military matters, making them excellently placed to act as hidden agents of the Ordos Calixis. Equally, having an Acolyte placed within an extension of Hax's power base may also suit an Inquisitor who suspects the Chaliced Commissariat and those in the Lord Sector's inner circle.

A character who becomes part of the Chaliced Commissariat automatically gains the Feared and Loathed trait (see sidebar).

#### **Required Career:** Guardsman.

**Required Spent Experience:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp).

#### **Feared and Loathed (Trait)**

Members of the Chaliced Commissariat act with a brutal autonomy thanks to the indulgence of Lord Sector Hax. Their elimination of seditious elements within PDF units and pitiless reputation means that members of PDF units or Imperial Guard units raised within Calixis respond with fear and deep-seated loathing to a member of the Chaliced Commissariat.

As a member of this organisation, you gain a +10 bonus on Inquiry and Intimidate Tests when used against members of the Imperial Guard or PDF. You take a –10 penalty, however, when Testing Charm or Command on the same groups.

**Note:** This Trait depends as much on the uniform, manner and bearing as anything else, and if the character is otherwise dressed, unrecognised or disguised its effects do not apply.

#### **Feral Warrior**

*"I know not what they will do to the enemy, but by the God-Emperor they terrify me!"*

— Lord Luther Kronus, on the Mortressan Sythewind Regiment.

While the unnumbered ranks of the Imperial Guard form the basis of the military might on which the Imperium is founded, they are far from a homogenised fighting force. Aside from the imposition of order and standardisation of wargear the Munitorium provides, each regiment is as individual as the world that spawns it, and often the most unique are those drawn from feral worlds. The savagery of such worlds, both in terms of the constant warfare that their primitive peoples engage in and the often deadly flora and fauna encountered there, make for excellent material for breeding men and women for whom enduring danger and conflict are second nature long before a lasgun is ever placed in their hands. In many cases, regiments raised on feral worlds (and even a few death worlds and the more unstable feudal worlds) are highly sought after by the Munitorium and represent that world's only tithe to the Imperium, such is the value placed in their fighting stock. Most of these regiments have their number heavily drilled, forcibly educated and disciplined to bring them in line with Imperial Guard tactical doctrine and practices, channelling their warlike spirits in the Emperor's service. Some, though, often the most bloodthirsty and savage examples, are allowed to hold on to much of their "old ways" (with the exception of heretical beliefs) and maintain their brutal and close-combat oriented fighting styles, as it is this very savagery and skill that is their greatest asset. In these cases, the regiment, usually employed as shock troops and assault specialists, suffer heavy casualties in the breach of any war zone to which they are assigned, leaving behind a hard and veteran core of elite warriors that can often match the fury of the worst enemies of mankind, be they renegade, xenos or servant of the Ruinous Powers, blow-for-blow.

In the Calixis Sector there are a number of feral worlds that serve this purpose for the Departmento Munitorium, although the characteristics of each are very different. Of those worlds with large enough populations to make the raising of regiments a worthy exercise, Endrite's people are deemed true savages, a bloodthirsty and vicious lot. Intensely superstitious, they kill and maim over the slightest provocation, and place little value, it seems to outsiders, even on their own lives. Eminently expendable, Endrite "head-hunter" regiments are quickly rounded up and thrown into the breach when needed by the Calixis Munitorium, who ensure their loyalty with a deployment of their least subtle Commissars and a sizable contingent of Imperial preachers.

Of better mettle are the famed "Sythewind" of the feral death world of Mortressa, whose Guardsmen, armed with their ever-present hand axes, make for phenomenally adept scouts and infiltrators. The Mortressan iron-tribes are some of the most renowned hunters and beast slayers in the entire sector, as befits their survival against the veritable hordes of carnosaurs and other dangerous predators that populate their world. Ever since the sector's early days, a Sythewind regiment has been maintained and continuously (if slowly) replenished, rather than re-raised, owing to the world's relatively small population, with the few surviving veterans given special dispensation to return to their home world once their duty is done. There, they form a respected ruling class of elders who pass their knowledge and wide experience down to the young hunters of their tribe, creating a culture where to be chosen for Imperial service is the highest of honours.

Aside from these famed worlds, there are others from which savage fighters are recruited as mercenaries, swear allegiance to off-world powers and are even abducted to serve as blood sport attractions for the wealthy and jaded. Fedrid, Volnox and even ill-storied Dusk have their own hard-bitten killers to offer, while the infamous strife-torn world of Iocanthos, with its long millennia of open, unmitigated conflict, offers the Ashleen technologically adept savages whose barbarity and fury often equals or exceeds the most culturally regressed and animalistic "true" feral worlder.

#### **Becoming a Feral Warrior**

Whether a former Imperial Guardsman, or a sometime mercenary who bartered his skills to leave his world of origin, a feral warrior is a fighter who, while fully trained in modern weaponry and tactics, has embraced the savage heritage within and now wields anger and the brutal gifts his background has granted as his greatest weapon. The physical power and martial skills of the feral warrior are highly valued by Inquisitors who know that to hunt down and destroy the heretic and the abomination, they need the best and most brutal fighters of their own. Feral worlders are also by their very nature survivors, able to endure the worst hardships and not baulk in the face of injury or fear. They are used to fighting and acting independently, another asset in situations where Acolytes may well find themselves outnumbered and reliant on their own resources to prevail.

#### **Required Career:** Guardsmen.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp). **Other Requirements:** You must originate from a Feral World.

#### **Beast Hunter (Talent)**

Many feral worlders were beast hunters long before they saw Imperial service. Of them, many come from cultures where, to survive their forbears, they had to become adept at bringing down the largest and most dangerous of prey. Such hard-won wisdom is rarely forgotten by their descendants.

Whenever you score a Critical Effect against a creature with a Size class of Hulking or larger, increase your Damage by +3. This does not apply to artificial constructs such as servitors, warp creatures such as Daemons, entities with the From Beyond trait, or things with a completely unrecognisable anatomy.

#### **Death Worlds**

Death worlds come in many varied forms, but each is ultimately inimical to human life. The kind that comes most readily to the Imperial mind is covered in a steaming endless jungles teaming with hostile life, such as infamous Mortressa in the Calixis Sector, although, they are just as likely to be ash-strewn volcanic wastelands, or planets ravaged by terrible nuclear holocausts or where ancient and virulent diseases run unchecked and unstoppable. Such worlds are almost impossible to colonise, but often, through abandonment or sheer bloody-mindedness, humanity has managed to survive there in limited numbers despite the odds. The battle for survival is only won at the cost of civilisation in many cases, with most human native populations sunk to the level of feral hunter-gatherers.

Some Death worlds are inhabited regardless of the risk owing to the presence of valuable resources, or held at all costs for strategic reasons. One such world is Haddrak on the edge of the Adrantis Nebula, a world where vast sulphurous seas have poisoned the land and acid storms driven by hurricane-force winds can strip flesh from bone in moments. Yet even on Haddrak life endures. Here the Adeptus Mechanicus of the Sollex sect are based, drawn to the world by its unique crystalline deposits, their black basalt fortress stabs up through to burning skies like a clawed hand. Life, needless to say, for the unfortunates born, stationed or shipped to a death world is unutterably hard and perilous, and almost without exception only those strong both in body and mind survive.

## **Legate Investigator**

*"Did you receive the heretics into your company? Did you swear to them any service? Did you, knowing that they are the foulest of traitors, aid them by deliberate act, by tolerating their presence, or by the sin of silence when knowing of heresy?"*

— from the Blessed Rituals of Inquiry, Volume IX.

Heresy is most skilled at hiding its face from those who would find it out and persecute it. Conspiracies, cults and false creeds hide themselves behind layers of petty crime, local prejudices, crude fakery, false rumour and seeming foolishness, as well as more labyrinthine plots and intricate layers of well-crafted lies and deceit. Cutting through these distractions to find the truth, no matter how deeply buried, is the trade of the Legate Investigator.

Fully ranked Inquisitors of the Holy Ordos are rare individuals, and in large inquiries or full-scale purges they must often delegate the minutiae of sifting through detail, and the questioning under duress of hundreds, sometimes thousands of suspects to others in their retinue—tasks for which the Legate is exhaustively trained. Gifted with a special seal of authority for the duration of a particular enquiry, these Legates are variously called "cult breakers", "hounds", and "brothers of question" by their fellows in the Ordos Calixis. If an Acolyte makes a particular success of their time as a legate, it is popularly viewed as a sign that the recipient may be headed for an Inquisitorial rosette themselves one day.

The use of Legate Investigators is common amongst Inquisitors, a tradition within the Ordos Calixis since before its formal foundation. To be invested as a Legate is to receive a portion of the power of an Inquisitor, though in a strictly limited and defined form based upon the enquiry they are involved in and for a very limited duration. Such powers usually extend to command authority over local law enforcement, detention, requisition and question, but rarely much further. When an investigation is complete, the authority of the Legates involved is formally ended.

Despite the potential for advancement in the role, some Acolytes see Legates as unfortunate drudges used by their master to plough through tedious months of interrogations and mountains of interminable records, only to find that there is nothing beyond the most minor criminal activity present. Other unfortunates are left to clean up endless loose threads after the main thrust of their Inquisitor's wrath has been expended and they themselves have moved on. This view does have some basis as the Ordos Calixis do invest and dispatch Legates where Inquisitorial involvement is being demanded, but thought largely unnecessary by the higher authority. Some Inquisitors invest Legates and dispatch them on an investigation simply to stir up what may be lurking beneath the mud, using them as literal and open bait to draw heresy and dark forces out into the open—obviously, this last task is far from popular with the Acolytes in question. More subtle Inquisitors use legates to give formal weight to a largely covert operation, knowing that their Acolytes will have access to greater resource without having to wait on petitions to local authority or constantly having to refer back to higher powers.

The granting of even a fraction of the absolute authority of an Inquisitor, even closely defined as in this case, is a very serious matter indeed, only ever entrusted to the most promising and able of Acolytes, and often to candidates who have successfully performed such a role before. Failure or misuse of such an office also holds the distinct prospect of censure and harsh punishment.

#### Secret Tongues and Hidden Ciphers of the Ordos Calixis

The Inquisition has many secrets to hide and many subtle and terrifying tools with which to preserve them. One layer of secrecy comes from the thousands of coded languages and cipher methods used by its servants. Here are but a few of the tongues, ciphers and codes used within the Ordos Calixis.

#### Augustinian

Created by an Inquisitor of a neighbouring sector, this simple series of phrases and pictograms has wide use throughout the Segmentum Obscurus and is part of the so-called Augustine Protocols, a set of Inquisitorial practices and training methods dating back at least four millennia. Augustinian uses phrases and simple hand drawn pictograms to stand for particular situations or threats. "Lidless brother", for example, means "you are under surveillance by other agents of the Inquisition" and can be said, written or represented by its pictogram of a crude eye with a diagonal slash across it.

#### Cryptos Cognos

A relatively recent addition to the canon of Inquisitorial codes, this subtle means of covert communication is based not only on phrases, but voice cadence, inflection and accompanying body language. Exclusively used by graduates of the secretive Tenebrae Collegium, it is so subtle that even sharp-eyed observers could see and hear an entire conversation held on some seemingly innocuous subject and be completely unaware of what was truly being said.

#### The Gimel Progression

Aside from the standard Imperial and Inquisitorial codes, the Ordos Calixis use an ultra-high security cipher for transmissions sent via astropathic chorus, courier and vox. The Gimel Progression varies in security depending on the importance of the message with the lowest being Gimel-Ardent, progressing to Gimel-Amethyst, and finally Gimel-Obsidian. The Gimel sequences are based on seemingly random substitution code words based on a rotating encryption rumoured to consist of all ten thousand volumes of the Codex Administratum and several other noteworthy texts.

#### The Nephilim Cipher

There are some records that are not just secret but dangerous to any that would access them. For such material, a cipher that is not only unbreakable but can also bind what it is used to code is needed. The Nephilim Cipher is one such cipher. It is based on sacred mathematical translations and ancient symbols of binding, most commonly employed to encode material relating to the nature of Daemons and the warp. Legend has it that this code dates back to the very founding of the Holy Ordos.

#### The Tantalus Fractal

Highly unusual, the Tantalus Fractal is a tech-code, a construction of binary incantations and data-djinn locked one on top of another in seven-dimensional formula with potentially infinite combinations and deadlocks. The Tantalus is used by the highest-ranking tech-priests in the service of the Inquisition to encrypt the most dangerous of data, often referring to blasphemous works of tech-heresy and xenos artifice. It is said that the Tantalus holds numerous hidden traps within its makeup more than capable of overloading and destroying cogitators and driving mad or even killing savants attempting to unlock its secrets.

#### **Bearing The Sigil of Question**

All Legate Investigators bear a formal carta of inquiry (their Legature) and a Sigil of Question that demonstrates their remit and authority under the Ordos Calixis. These two things are proof of their authority and status. The first is a document that states the locale of investigation and the focus of concern, granting the bearer the absolute right to question and examine who or whatsoever they wish on presentation and corroboration of a Sigil of Inquiry. The Sigil of Inquiry is an icon made of silver featuring the sign of a chalice engraved with the symbol of the Inquisition. It may be worn as a medallion, carried in a wallet or worn on the finger as a ring, and contains within it a code-key system for verification and secure data-access if needed.

#### **Becoming a Legate Investigator**

Becoming a Legate Investigator is as much about acknowledgement of capability and potential by an Acolyte's Inquisitorial masters as it is a willingness or want on the part of the player or character. The opening up of this Career Rank to one or more members of a group of Acolytes may be a form of reward by the GM for a deftly accomplished mission or successful campaign, or some similar accomplishment. Chiefly, this career shows that a character is both trusted and viewed as capable by their superiors. Whether they live up to such trust is in the player's hands.

Once this Rank has been taken, the character has permanent access to its Advance Scheme, although the Legate's authority only applies for the length of a particular enquiry or mission within the game.

**Required Career:** Adept, Arbitrator, Cleric, Guardsman, or Imperial Psyker.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 4 or higher (2,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must have the Literacy skill. In addition, you can only select this Alternate Rank if your Inquisitor offers it to you.

## **Malfian Bloodsworn**

*"Now be a nice gent and come here and bleed on this warrant for me, eh? Then I'll make it quick for ye, otherwise I'll get a bit put out, and well… I hate swabbing the floor and getting nice parchment dirty. Seems so… undignified like."*

— Auric Kenge, Chartered Bloodsworn.

The Blood Guild of Malfi is one of the most infamous organisations of bounty hunters and man-trackers in the whole sector. It owes its origins to some long forgotten internecine war in Malfi's history of vendetta and civil infighting—a history that far predates Malfi's "liberation" during the Angevin Crusade. The Blood Guild has long served to track down, apprehend or slaughter fugitives whose warrants have been issued by the Malfian Senate. The members of the guild, the Bloodsworn as they are called, are professionals, the best it is said that money can buy at their craft, and drafted from the ranks of hardened ex-guardsmen, disgraced Arbites, outcast armsmen from the noble houses and all manner of killers and gunfighters come up from the underhive the hard way. This broad church operates only one rule—a warrant must be carried out scrupulously, but it doesn't matter what methods are used. The Bloodsworn owe little loyalty to each other either. Indeed several guild members might seek to execute the same lucrative warrant, and such often lethal "competition" is actively encouraged in the guild as a means of weeding out those not up to the standards of the guild's reputation—not that simple attrition doesn't take care of this anyway.

Most blood warrants are aptly named, issued in the form of a tough parchment scroll bearing the seal of the authorising body and carrying within it a gene-lock circuit amulet designed to identify the victim by their blood when spilled over it. The execution of these warrants requires the subject's termination, or, more rarely, his capture for trial. Some warrants may add further gruesome specifics to the discharge notice. The returning of the bloodstained warrant results in payment drawn on Malfi's own Obsidian Chancellery. Falsifying such a warrant in some way is a dire matter indeed, and immediately results in a blood-price of truly staggering proportions being placed on the head of the malefactor by the guild.

As a part of Malfi's often impenetrable legal code and endemic culture of vendetta, a holder of a Bloodsworn Charter has certain rights above that of a mere common hired gun. The warrant enables them to bear arms in the hive where others would not, access to legal record, enter private dwellings, and even avoid interference (largely) from local enforcers and armsmen in pursuit of their warrants. These powers have their limits, however, and any Bloodsworn had better be wary of just who's property they trample on or in whose territory they operate unless they wish to find an abrupt and bloody end. Nor do their customary rights extend to the holdings or persons of the Adepta or Malfi's rulers, not that many would be so foolish.

Once confined to the continent spanning hives of Malfi, the Bloodsworn are recognised across the Malfian sub-sector and, for the right price, there is nowhere the Bloodsworn won't track down their prey regardless, a fact that has spread their infamy across the sector and beyond. The Bloodsworn are afforded a fearful respect throughout the Calixis Sector, and quite aside from their quasi-legal role as bounty hunters, many also turn their hands to assassination, bodyguard and mercenary work if the chance arises, relying on their skills and reputation to set a high price for their services.

Many Inquisitors are not above hiring members of the Bloodsworn into their own service for obvious reasons, and some even back their Acolytes to become Bloodsworn to take advantage of the cover it can provide during their covert operations, to say nothing of the contacts and even revenue gained.

#### **Becoming a Member of the Blood Guild of Malfi**

Becoming part of the Blood Guild is deceptively simple: the candidates must make their way to one of the guild's charter houses on the worlds of the Malfian sub-sector, offer payment of a thousand Throne gelt, and, as long as they themselves are not under subject to warrant and are not subject to "higher oath", they are given a "grey warrant" to execute. Grey warrants are those that have languished uncollected on the charter house's books for some time, usually because the money offered doesn't merit the danger involved in the collection. To become Bloodsworn, all they need to is successfully claim the warrant by any means necessary (which can include the help of others and might form a small adventure for the Player Characters). Once successful, the candidate must then swear a blood oath to abide by the guild's rule. The candidate is given a guild symbol as credential and is entered on the charter list. They may then claim the right to the title of "Bloodsworn" and execute lawful warrants as long as they survive to do so.

**Required Career:** Assassin or Scum, and Guardsmen or Arbitrators who are no longer in overt Imperial service. **Alternate Rank:** 5 or higher (3,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** Must gain a charter from the Blood Guild of Malfi.

**Special Elite Advance: Bloodsworn Charter** Upon successfully entering this career path, the character gains a Bloodsworn Charter and the privileges and rights outlined in the Alternate Rank description.

Although all initiates of the Machine God are versed to some extent in conflict and the skills of warfare, certain Mechanicus sects and military formations exist to study the art of destruction with the ardent fervour that their fellows might apply to the creation of machinery or the recovering of lost technoarcana. Chief among these in the Calixis Sector are the forces of the Auxilia Myrmidon, also known by some as the siege engineers or war-savants. Legend has it they came to the sector during the earliest days of the Angevin Crusade for reasons of their own, and have since remained to defend the Cult Mechanicus's possessions here. Myrmidons are expert killers, weapon masters and destroyers. At the behest of the ruling Archmagos of the Forge Worlds, they are sent to accompany explorators in investigating finds in the most dangerous sectors of space and retrieve the most hazardous xenos-specimens, while others are tasked to hunt down renegades accused of the foulest techno-heresies and terminate them with extreme prejudice.

Tech-priests who devote themselves to battle are often inducted into one of the militant sects as their knowledge and prowess increases over time, either through their own application or the will of their distant Archmagos masters. The first rank of the Mechanicus militant is the Secutor, an ancient designation believed to date back, like much of the Auxilia's organisation and secrets, to the armed forces of the Mechanum of Mars in distant pre-Imperial antiquity. It is a fact that only adds to their mystery and makes them a subject for some concern to those in the Adepta whose arcane knowledge stretches to understand what this implies. Certainly this conclusion is backed-up by the ancient and terrifying weapons, relics of that distant past which they are known to sometimes employ.

Within the Calixis Sector, the undisputed centre of the Auxilia Myrmidon's power is the Lathe System and its vast forge network, and in particular their heavy fortified arsenal and base on the city-sized panopticon orbital station. From this mustering ground, the relatively few Myrmidons are dispatched in small bands to oversee the defences of the Mechanicus's domains, seek out and destroy their enemies. The Myrmidons, although largely independent, are closely linked to the Archmagos of the Lathes, who is one of their guarantors of their dominance.

They are not, however, the only militant Mechanicus faction in the sector, and over the last century a highly mystical tech-sect based at the forge facilities on the death world of Haddrak in the northern rim of the Adrantis Nebula has grown to prominence and increasing power. The Divine Light of Sollex, as they call themselves, are zealots in the Machine God's cause, as coldly fanatic and savage in their way as any Redemptionist of the Imperial Creed. To them, the preservation of the arcane mysteries of the Machine Cult from those who would misuse them are of far greater worth than petty wealth, worldly power or the lives of their fellow men, or even other members of the Cult Mechanicus.

Towering figures of steel shrouded in blood-red robes and bedecked in hardpoint, mounted weaponry of arcane manufacture, the Myrmidons and other tech-priests militant are war makers whose knowledge of the arts of siege craft, weaponry and devastation is without peer. Although few in number, they are baleful opponents to face in battle. Heavily augmented, they are relentless, implacable, and the most powerful among them are all but impossible to kill. Myrmidons are held in no little fear and awe by other members of the Machine Cult, and have commonly subjected themselves to cybernetic reconstruction far beyond enginseers or precepts.

You can find more information on the Mechanicus, their domains and their arms of war in Chapter V. Additionally, membership of the sect of the Divine Light of Sollex is available as an optional starting Background Package as detailed in Chapter I.

#### **Becoming a Mechanicus Secutor**

Some tech-priests are drawn to the path of the Secutor through a fascination with the unique and intellectual challenges warfare provides, while others feel themselves drawn to the intricacies and beauties of creation and destruction, or the sacred art of weaponsmithing. Others simply see this path as a means to an end, either for the protection of the Machine Cult, the furtherance of their own independent researches, or some other, hidden agenda. Regardless of their vocation, a tech-priest skilled in such destructive arts as the Secutor is an invaluable ally for an Inquisitor, and makes for a singularly lethal Acolyte. The only downside to such an association is that the Holy Ordos can never be fully sure where the tech-priest Secutor's loyalties lie—even more so than others of their kind—or what ancient and dark secrets they may themselves possesses.

It is likely, as you spend xp on this Alternative Career, your character will advance several Ranks in the Tech-Priest Career Path. While doing so, you can use the following titles for your Mechanicus Secutor character within the Machine Cult instead of the standard ones listed for the Tech-Priest Career if you wish. After taking these Alternate Ranks, it's best to follow the path of the Technomancer on the Career Progression Table described in Dark Heresy, if you have not yet reached the point of division on the path.

| Rank | Name            | XP            |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| 4    | Secutor         | 2,000–2,999   |
| 5    | Myrmidon        | 3,000–5,999   |
| 6    | Centurius       | 6,000–7,999   |
| 7    | Tribune/ Magnus | 8,000–9,999   |
| 8    | Magos Militant  | 10,000–14,999 |
|      |                 |               |

**Required Career:** Tech-Priest.

**Alternate Rank:** 4 or higher (2,000 xp). Other Requirements: WS 35, BS 35, WP 35, any four Weapon Training talents.

Standard Template Constructs

The Adeptus Mechanicus is driven by the quest for knowledge. This quest takes many forms, including research and exploration, but its ultimate embodiment is the search for ancient Standard Template Construct (STC) systems.

These were created during the Dark Age of Technology to provide all the technical information needed to construct anything that settlers might need. Even the least technically accomplished person could build a vehicle, aircraft or weapon given time. One result of the STC system and its pivotal place in human colonisation is that human material culture is very similar, even on worlds which are many thousands of light years apart.

Today there are no known surviving STC systems and only a very few examples of first-generation texts. For thousands of years the Adeptus Mechanicus has pursued all information about the STC. Any scrap of information is eagerly sought out and jealously hoarded. Any rumour of a functional system is followed up and investigated in force.

## **Metallican Gunslinger**

*"They say he's fast, like chain lightning fast. I don't believe 'em, no one's that fast."*

— Last words attributed to Kail Strom, bounty hunter, deceased.

The Gunslingers of Gunmetal City on Scintilla are the finest in the sector, the most infamous and the most lethal. In action, they are a blazing whirl of muzzle flashes, their hands so fast that their pistols seem mere extensions of their murderous will, and all around them people die. This is the craft of the Gunslinger, be they gang enforcers, famed arena champions or grim wanderers, a Metallican Gunslinger is worth the price if killing is involved. The Scintillan hive of Gunmetal adores the gun and honours above all others those who forge or wield them with great skill. With every man, woman or child packing at least one piece of cold iron, when a Metallican is said to be a skilled gunman, it is a stone cold truth, as they have managed to elevate themselves above a thousand others to be so named.

Among the ferocious gangs of the lower Infernis regions of the hive, one's choice of weapon, and skill with it, is a matter of gang honour, pride and renown and there are bewildering array of gunmen. Some consider a single shot kill the most sublime, honing their skills to become snipers the equal of any Guard veteran, while others prefer to be bedecked in weapons, spraying shells with wild abandon, knowing that they always have a backup piece should they hear that dreadful empty click. Others pay for crude grafts of slab muscle so they can heft the heaviest weapons crafted in the hive's fanes and forges. But above all in underworld status and popular myth are the Gunslingers, the duellists, the pistol fighters—they are the true embodiment of Gunmetal in all its deadly glory.

Most fine Gunslingers are undoubtedly from the gangs of the Infernis. In the scalding hot deeps, duels between gangs' finest pistol wielders are used to settle matters of reproach or insult between rivals (short of a full-blown gang war), and anyone who even thinks about using their pistol around an Infernis gang had better know how to use it. It is in this deadly crucible that the Gunslinger is made. While most Gunslingers find employ with the gangs, not an inconsiderable number find more legal employment as "Regulators", hired muscle for the fanes and forges that are the true power in Gunmetal City. Some may take employ as high-priced bodyguards and others (often short-lived) as attractions seeking fame and fortune in the mid-hive arenas, depending on their skills to keep them alive before the baying crowd. The hivers and underhivers of Gunmetal City are not alone in their reverence of the Gunslinger's art. Noble-born duellists, so called "gunrakes", prowl the upper hive reaches in search of slights against their honour so they may exercise their skill on a living target. A few of the boldest gunrakes venture into the Infernis to test the true extent of their skill. A few even survive.

Though they all are dedicated to the deadly way of the pistol, Gunslingers are as different as the finely crafted weapons they wield. Some crave the renown and respect granted to the most infamous of their kind. The precision-crafted pistols gifted by a famous fane, the tremor and awe their name inspires, and the hush that descends on a room when they walk in are the finest things life can offer to them. Others are products of a freakish fusing of madness, flamboyance and skill, deadly strutting peacocks festooned with holstered weapons, as quick to flash a smile and make a mocking aside as they are to slaughter a room full of people. If, however, you ask an Infernis ganger what is the most dangerous breed of Gunslinger, they are sure to tell you it is those who have seen too much, lived too long, killed too many, haunted, empty men and women with dead eyes, who say little, seem to drift aimless and alone, and can kill you before you even see them move. This cold breed of wanderers are the fear of even the deadliest ganger, and the most prized, if quixotic, of hired guns. They are the pale death, patient and inevitable waiting for all who follow the way of the gun.

#### **Becoming a Metallican Gunslinger**

Becoming a Gunslinger from Gunmetal City is a matter of desire and skill and is an excellent choice for a character seeking to be the epitome of brutal Gunmetal City itself. You may start play having already set on this course or come to it as your career develops. Inquisitors are likely to find a Gunslinger's destructive skills useful, but do be warned you are not alone in your adoration of the pistol's dance, and your showy demonstrations of skill may cause your master as many problems as it solves; that and, if you survive to became truly skilled, others may see you as a means to prove themselves. Infamy after all does have a price. When you become a Metallican Gunslinger, you automatically gain the Knave of Pistols trait, which imposes limitations on your character.

**Required Career:** Assassin or Scum.    

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (o xp).

Note this means you may opt to specify this at character creation as your Advance Scheme. This does not affect your basic starting Skills and Talents, only how and on what you can spend your starting xp.

**Other Requirements:** BS 30 and you must also have Gunmetal City as your Home World.

#### **Knave of Pistols (Trait)**

Metallican Gunslingers are notoriously proud of their skill with pistols and eschew all other ranged weapons. With this Trait, you may not acquire new Basic or Heavy Weapon Training talents and may only take Exotic Weapon Training for pistols. If you already have training in ranged weapons that are not pistols, you may still use these Talents, but you take a –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests.

## **Moritat Reaper**

*"I never saw the killer fully, though I thank the Saviour-Emperor for her. We'd lost half the squad and Proctor Aeldred had just gone down with his throat bit open. I fired off the last round from my Puritan and had nothing left but my boot knife and a prayer on my lips when this dark shape dropped from the gantry above. The carrionates, well, the rotted things just came apart, black clotted blood and rancid flesh everywhere. The one in front of me went down in five twitching chunks and I swear I didn't see a single sword stroke fall… a miracle sir. The Emperor's own bloody work—like a death angel from the old hive tales."*

— Deputy Provost Morcar, Report on the Morningside Incident, Hive Gloriana.

The Moritat are an ancient Imperial Death Cult devoted to the art of the blade and their own dark and bloody interpretation of the Imperial Creed. The Moritat's membership view themselves as a sect of assassin-mystics in service ultimately of the God-Emperor Himself, and deem their killings divinely licensed, if not directly ordained. In the Moritat's dogma (as it is with many death cults), blood holds a sacred place: it represents both beating life and the shed blood of the countless millions who have been martyred so humanity can continue to exist. Particularly, it embodies the sacrifice of the Emperor Himself. For the Moritat, then, there is no more sacred act than the spilling of blood and for this reason they prefer to do their work with the edge of the blade over any other implement of death.

Their secret rituals revolve around blood and, to them, no lesson is truly learned and no truth uncovered without bloodshed to mark its moment. Central to the Moritat's doctrine and training is the "travail", the processes of struggle and lethal combat making up the course of their lives and serving to hone their skills. During this time, the Moritat makes their way as a contracted assassin, often only for a nominal fee or a bizarre or symbolic item of payment, or, just as often, as a murderer who seeks out worthy targets among those skilled enough to prove challenging or who they regard as the Emperor's foes—heretics, mutants, cultists and witches, although a particular Moritat has his or her own favoured targets. Many Moritat find service with the Holy Ordos during this period as the goals of the Inquisition and the Moritat's chosen victims marry well together. The sanction of Inquisitorial authority often serves to cover up the assassin's less orthodox habits. The Moritat assassin is watched in secret by members of their own cult throughout the travail and once their superiors deem they have grown sufficiently skilled enough, they are initiated into the cult's higher mysteries, becoming a thing of whispered legend—a Moritat Reaper.

A Moritat Reaper is a vision of death incarnate with a blade, skilled to an extent that few can match: agile, fanatical and merciless. They are also patient, capable of waiting still for hours in the shadows or stalking their prey for days before choosing the right moment to strike. Once unleashed in combat, they erupt in savage grace, their blades leaping, slashing and severing with seemingly wild abandon, belying the consummate precision with which their bloodletting is driven. Once drenched in the blood of their victims, only then is a Moritat satiated and offers up thanks to the Emperor in silent prayer in his or her own cult's tongue, laced, it is said, with a million metaphors of death.

The services of a Moritat Reaper as an Acolyte is a highly valuable commodity in the Holy Ordos of the Calixis Sector, particularly with those who prefer their killings and purges to take the shape of precisely orchestrated strikes and assassinations over public witch hunts and storm trooper raids.

#### **Becoming a Moritat Reaper**

To become a Moritat Reaper, you must have been created with the option of the Moritat Assassin Background Package, (see Chapter I), and this Career choice is designed to be a culmination of that that Origin and choice. Over the course of your adventures, you must also stay true to the Moritat's dogma and defeat several of the cult's favoured enemies in single combat with the edge of the blade.

#### **Required Career:** Assassin.

**Required Experience:** Rank 6: Death Adept or higher (6,000 xp).

**Other Requirements:** You must be a member of the Moritat and remain true to that Death Cult's code.

#### **The Reaping (Talent)**

The deadly fighting arts of the Moritat teach a special manoeuvre only made possible by their near preternatural skill with a blade, allowing one great devastating cut with which several opponents can be despatched in a great effusion of sacred blood.

By taking a Full Action in combat while using a sword or similarly edged weapon, you can make a single attack against every eligible target in close combat with you. You declare which target you attack first and then move in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction (your choice) making an attack against each target in turn. Test Weapon Skill and roll Damage separately. These attacks can be Parried or Dodged as normal, but if an attack is successfully Parried, the Reaping blow is stopped and you can make no further attacks.

#### **Reclaimator**

*"Tranters, primes, 'lthic cells, hand rippers, I can get 'em all, reconditioned and good as new—even a batch of good slaught. Great wheel o' the steel god crush me if it's not so… The price? Let's not quibble about the price. You see, I know this up-hive guilder rolling in gelt and he needs a little intel you may have the knowing of yourself…"*

— Obadiah Plex, Hive Magnogorsk Reclaimator.

Technology is a thing little understood and its workings lie shrouded in mystery and superstition for most of humanity. The Adeptus Mechanicus holds undispuhe sister is Alva Vaakon. We are not related to the famous Vaakhon.
Make up common lies for origin, how we met, whted rights to the secret lore of science and technology, but the tech-priests themselves are comparably few in number and particularly set against the teeming billions of the hive worlds or the isolated crews of ships plying the void. Such people rely on technological infrastructure in great profusion simply to live, be it a hive water-recyk system or a ship's thermal heaters. The ongoing low-grade maintenance of such petty systems, along with the day-to-day workings of the more sophisticated parts of a manufactora's machinery and the like are left to an army of technomats, functionaries, duct-crawlers, voidwalkers and work-prefects gifted by their Mechanicus masters with just sufficient knowledge to perform their tasks with due deference and supplication to the machine-spirits and nothing more.

Of this disparate group, arguably the most skilled and certainly least trusted are the Reclaimators. It is their task to redeem raw materials from old and damaged systems, to scavenge parts and be tasked with the endless cycle of minor repairs needed to keep a ship flying or a hive's infrastructure from collapsing under its own weight. By necessity, a Reclaimator's skills begin to stray into a higher understanding of machinery and technology than most and many learn to worship the Machine God in a fragmentary and superstitious manner, marking them apart from others. Added to which, the Reclaimators themselves are often sent in to dangerous or unsafe areas with little direct supervision, and they scavenge and salvage a good deal more than their masters know. As a result, most Reclaimators have a well-deserved reputation as suspicious, shifty characters who sell their skills and the items they retrieve or repair for a good profit on the black market. Many have links to criminal gangs and more than a few are willing to resort to robbery and even murder to build up their spoils if they think they can get away with it.

In the Calixis Sector, Reclaimators are common in the reaches of the hive-cities of Scintilla, Malfi and other worlds, as well as, serving on the great Chartist vessels and numerous small trader ships. Despite their vital purpose, rarely, however, do they enjoy a good reputation, although in some places their ill-renown is more deserved than others. In the depth of the Sibellus underhive, it is well organised networks of hereteks and "reks" that are the real power behind the infamous narcogangs. On war-ravaged Tranch, the men and women who make up the numerous Reclaimator scav-packs that prowl the ruins are often little more than murderous bandits weighed down by dead men's plunder and broken trinket-fetishes. Among the void born it is no different; the wreaker crews of breaker-ships and junkers are considered untrustworthy and accursed of their kind and the void families tell dark stories of death-scows, haunted vessels filled with scavengers driven to cannibalism and madness by want or by uncovering something best left alone in their desire for valuable salvage.

In one place in the sector, perhaps perversely, the Reclaimator is held in high esteem, and that place is Volg. In this most nightmarish of hives, the Reclaimator’s knowledge is a vital part of sustaining life against the myriad hazards the hivers must struggle against on a daily basis. Given very little to work with in the city’s environs, the Reclaimators of Volg have a reputation for coming up with nearly miraculous (if often crazed and dangerous) solutions to keep things running, and ever more inventively salvage weapons to drive away the bloated things crawling up from below. Some point to their unusual designs and the local worship of a debased form of the Machine God by the Reclaimators in the shape of “Ironskull” as evidence of the influence of rogue tech-priests exiled to Volg as punishment in times past.

# The Path of the Tech-Heresy

The most gifted and reckless Reclaimators learn too much, either through acquiring knowledge forbidden to them through stealing data, by daring the tech-heresy of invention, or the blasphemy of reverse-engineering. In doing so they become something far worse, they become "hereteks". Subject to the harshest of penalties under law and the wrath of the Cult of the Machine God, hereteks are outlaws who use their skills to arm and equip criminal gangs and even cults and mutant renegades, as well as supply the underhive with a wealth of illegal drugs and forbidden technology for profit, or more rarely to fund their own dangerous experiments. The more common hereteks and those that pursue other, rarer tech-heresies such as the creation of artificial sentience (or the Silica Animus as the Machine Cult names it), illegal bio-constructs and xenos-technology, are subject not only to punishment by Imperial law and the persecution of the Holy Ordos, but also bring down the wrath of the Cult Mechanicus itself. Of those that pursue such anathema in the Calixis Sector, most notable are several militant sects of the Mechanicus such as the Myrmidon Secutors and the Divine Light of Sollex, both of whom care little for legal process or collateral damage.

#### **Becoming a Reclaimator**

Hive and void born Scum with a technically-minded bent, or those who fancy themselves as dealmakers and traders often start their careers as technomats and

Reclaimators before focusing on more "lucrative" work. While for those born in the iron canyons of a forge world's macro-industry, the path of the Reclaimator and perhaps ultimately the heretek is a natural one to follow. Likewise, the Inquisition sees them as a useful resource. Often a cut above their kind in terms of intelligence, a Reclaimator can make an excellent agent for infiltrating criminal gangs, contacting cult groups and passing unobserved through the hive and underhive, while their void born brethren are just as useful aboard ship or working orbitals and dockyards.

Regardless, it is wise for an Acolyte with such abilities and history to avoid too many entanglements and questions from the Mechanicus, or they run the risk of being labelled a heretek and suffer a fate even the sanction of the Holy Ordos might not save them from.

#### **Required Career:** Scum.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (o xp).

**Note:** This means you may opt to specify this at Character Creation as your Advance Scheme. Selecting this Alternate Rank does not affect your basic starting Skills and Talents; it only affects where you spend your starting xp.

**Other Requirements:** Int 30 and you must be from a Hive World, Forge World or Void Born Origin.

#### **Sister Oblatia**

*"If I must die, I shall welcome Death as an old friend, and wrap mine arms around it."*

— Oath of the Penitent.

For some sisters of the Sororitas, the desire to atone overwhelms them and they take up the oath of the penitent. To become a penitent is to throw aside any thoughts of advancement, self, or any lesser oaths of duty and to seek absolution through a glorious, martyr's death, willingly exiling themselves from their Order and any remaining ties to life in doing so. To their peers these penitent sisters are at once outcasts and revered as something sacred—pilgrims on a hard and noble quest at the end of which shines the pure light of the Emperor's grace. The most famed examples of those undergoing the oath of the penitent are the Sisters Repentia, who, through extreme self-inflicted suffering and the corporal mortification of their flesh, achieve a great and holy rage, hurling themselves with wild frenzy upon the enemies of the faithful, killing in a state of grace until they finally fall.

There are, however, other variations of the penitent's oath, rarer and more unusual but in their way no less remarkable. Once such is the oath of the Sister Oblatia: the oath of willing sacrifice for the sins of another. A sister who takes up this oath seeks not to atone for some direct misdeed of their own, but through profound spiritual conviction to take on the weight of another's sins, most commonly a blood relative, some infamous ancestor or stain on their family line, or, more rarely, for the past transgression of a friend, a people, or a whole world. Although she seeks ultimate atonement by the manner of her death, the onus on her is to atone through her deeds, most specifically in defeating humanities' great enemies—combating and defeating the heretic, the mutant, the witch and the alien without regard to self, injury or hardship. Through the Oblatia's battles, victories and ultimately the manner of their death, they hope to gain for the object of their sacrifice some measure of forgiveness in the Emperor's eyes.

Oblatia are accorded a respectful distance and honoured place in the prayers of their fellow Sororitas. Like the Repentia, they are viewed as pilgrims on a dark and lonely road, but at the end of which lies a shining goal. The Oblatia themselves often seem mercurial compared to other Sororitas, quick to righteous anger, stubborn, independent and brought to a life of endless wandering in search of the foe. Many are led on by the signs and portents of the Emperor's will and others by the divination of His sacred Tarot. Others gravitate towards rumours of corruption, war zones, and places of ill renown. Many, however, find service in the retinues of the Holy Inquisition, where their desire for righteous battle tallies all too well with the Inquisitor's path. But to the Inquisitors who readily employ their zealous fanaticism and undoubted skills to the Imperial Creed, comes the knowledge that their oath comes before any other vow or loyalty.

Most Oblatia come to their vows through spiritual revelation or after deep meditation of the nature of their holy vocation, although some few may have the oath in mind as the central cause of becoming Sororitas in the first place. Regardless of reason, only fully ordained Sisters may take the oath, and they must go before a specially convened synod of their superiors who judge the oath's validity and purity of intent, to ensure it owes nothing to hubris or vanity. The Oblatia must then undergo ritual fasting, mortification, and a symbolic severance from her life and Order before taking up the blade and making her vows before the God-Emperor; turning her back on her Sisters as a requiem mass is sung for her as if she were already dead. Most Sister Oblatia come from the ranks of the Orders Militant, but it not unknown for others to undertake the oath, often choosing to put their particular skills to lethal use in tracking down and defeating the enemies of the faith.

**Required Career:** Adepta Sororitas.

**Alternate Rank:** 5 or higher (3,000 xp).

#### **Duty Unto Death (Talent)**

**Requirement:** WP 45,

Such is the power of your faith that it can sustain you where mere flesh would fail. 

#### **Templar Calix of the Scholastia Psykana**

*"Will and blade, life and death, cause and consequence, mind and matter, soul's truth and warp's lie: all things indivisible and one."*

— Temple Calix Training Mantra.

Operating within the ranks of Imperial Sanctioned Psykers, the Psykana Temple Calix is an order of elite militant psyker-warriors, battle mystics devoted to personal skill at arms and the focusing of their psychic might and abilities to augment their power in close combat.

The Scholastia Psykana is made up clusters of sanctioned schools, methods and traditions that focus on the use of psychic power, which, although overseen and regulated by the authorities on Holy Terra, can vary greatly from sector to sector, both in their methods and in their philosophy. Within the Calixis Sector, there are many such branches of the Scholastia, one of the smallest and most reclusive of are the Templars Calix, whose isolated temple-monastery is based in the polar wastelands of Scintilla. While several branches of the Scholastia focus on preparing sanctioned battlefield psykers for use alongside the armies of the Imperium in the battlefield, or their function as specialist advisors to military commanders, the Psykana Temple Calix focuses instead on martial skill, honing the mind and body together to create deadly superhuman warriors who can vanquish their foes in a blaze of power and with the screaming edge of a force blade.

Some say the traditions of the Templars Calix came from one of Angevin's closest advisors who was a scion of a militant branch of the Scholastia originating in a distant part of the Segmentum Solar. Others claim it was Drusus who founded the temple to provide him with specialist bodyguards after his near death on Maccabeus Quintus. No matter what their origin, the mystic training of the Templars Calix today focus on the use of their member's psychic ability in conjunction with deadly methods of close-quarter fighting. Personal loyalty to the Golden Throne, psyker-mysticism, self-discipline and the fighting arts, both armed and unarmed, are drilled into the Psykana Templars. Their skills encompass brutally simple methods of killing an opponent and more elaborate manoeuvres commonly attributed only to assassins, as well as defensive techniques and practiced agility. The use of all manner of exotic weapons is also taught but the central focus of a Templar's training is the use of force weaponry, the psychoactive properties of which make these weapons extensions of the wielder's own power. In the hands of a Templar Calix, such a weapon becomes a channel for the destructive forces both of this world and beyond. Usually clothed in plain midnight-blue robes or the dark storm coats of the Adeptus Terra, when overt in displaying who and what they are, the Psykana Templars Calix wear close fitting cowled mantles of black samite and cover their visages with masks of tarnished silver to show blank and emotionless faces to the world.

The Psykana Templars Calix are few, even in comparison to other Orders of Sanctioned Psykers, and are in constant demand throughout the sector and beyond. Military commanders and high ranking adepts prize the presence of a Psykana Templar as a bodyguard above nearly all others. On rare occasions small units of Templars have been deployed as part of a full scale conflict, but such actions have not been seen for centuries. Of course, the psychic and martial skills of a Psykana Templar are of great use to the Inquisition, both as Acolyte agents and as highly effective executioners. No less than Lord Inquisitor Caidin himself, the Grand Master of the Ordos Calixis, is guarded and aided by a Psykana Templar Calix, known simply as Shade, a powerful telekine and swordsman of unearthly skill who is one of his most trusted servants.

#### **Becoming a Templar Calix of the Scholastia Psykana**

To become a Templar Calix you must achieve acceptance by the masters of the Psykana Temple Calix. These masters look primarily for a controlled and stable personality and psychic potential rather than martial skill (which they are supremely confident their training can impart). Joining the temple and going through training should occasion a period of several months "downtime" for the character between adventures. During this time they must help construct or obtain a force weapon of their own (see [page 187](#page-187-0) [and 245\), w](#page-245-0)hich may result in a small scenario for the Player Character at the GMs discretion.

It is likely that, as you spend experience on this Alternative Career, your character will advance several Ranks in the Savant Militant path. You can use the following titles for your Templar Calix character within the Order at those Ranks, instead of the standard ones listed for the Psyker Career.

| Rank | Name                 | XP            |
|------|----------------------|---------------|
| 4    | Templar Tertius      | 2,000–2,999   |
| 5    | Templar Secundus     | 3,000–5,999   |
| 6    | Templar Primus       | 6,000–7,999   |
| 7    | Templar Ordinator    | 8,000–9,999   |
| 8    | Master Templar Calix | 10,000–14,999 |

**Required Career:** Imperial Psyker.

**Alternate Rank:** 4: Savant Militant or higher (2,000 xp). **Other Requirements:** You must have no more than 10 Insanity Points and 10 Corruption Points.

#### **Martial Prowess**

Owing to the Temple's focus on martial skill above intellectualism, at the point of becoming a Templar Calix, the psyker changes their characteristic advance scheme as follows:

| Characteristic Simple Intermediate |     |     | Trained | Expert |
|------------------------------------|-----|-----|---------|--------|
| Weapon Skill                       | 100 | 250 | 500     | 750    |
| Intelligence                       | 500 | 750 | 1000    | 2500   |

Any Advances purchased for these Characteristics prior to taking the Alternative Career still count towards the Characteristic's development. For example, a psyker who has already bought a Simple Weapon Skill Advance has only three further Advances possible for this Characteristic.

#### **Tyrantine Shadow Agent**

*"Lest the truth devour all."* 

— Memento Mori on the Tomb of Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos.

The Inquisition, some say, is an empire of secrets. To outsiders, this is certainly the case, for in stern judgement and shrouded in mystery the Holy Ordos sit above them like wrathful gods, little understood and rightly feared. But what is not so widely known by outsiders is that there are many secrets the Inquisition keeps from its own, either because it is expedient to do so, or because they are simply too dangerous even for some members of the Ordos to know. These secrets are often held through invisible webs of patronage, fealty and alliance, but sometimes manifest themselves though shadow empires: whole organisations hidden under the wider umbrella of the Holy Ordos whose nature and concerns remain mysterious even to other Inquisitors and Acolytes. Within the Calixis Sector one such group is the Tyrantine Cabal.

Inside the Calixian Conclave, there is no greater divider than the Hereticus Tenebrae, the Tyrant Star. The supreme danger of the Star is not known to all even within the Inquisition's own ranks. Within the Calixian conclave, even those who do know something rarely have anything but a piece of the puzzle. In no small part, the Tyrantine Cabal is responsible for maintaining this ignorance, just as much as it is investigating what the Hereticus Tenebrae represents and how to combat it.

As the years have progressed, this web of secrecy and control has taken on a life almost of its own, and methods and agencies have sprung up to support it and its master's goals. One such powerful agency is the Tenebrae Collegium—a shadow empire all of its own founded by the genius of the renowned Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. The Collegium takes the most promising and suitable of Acolytes and transforms them into subtle and lethal instruments of deception, whose true allegiances can remain secret even from the Inquisitors they serve. These Acolytes are perfectly suited to keeping the Tyrantine Cabals purposes hidden and enacting its will without remorse or apprehension. The existence of the Collegium and its so-called "shadow agents" is a matter officially denied by the Cabal and the source of much secret debate and suspicion within the Conclave Calixis as a whole. How far does its reach stretch? How many agents does it have? And what darkness might go undiscovered lurking at the heart of such a strange and hidden power? Few know, but many outside the Cabal have grave misgivings, and some even have fashioned secret networks of their own in response.

#### **The Shadow Agents**

It is said Cassilda Cognos once quipped in a rare moment of levity that the Collegium "took outstanding dissemblers and accomplished liars and then began their work". Certainly, the results of the Collegium's conditioning do produce agents more than capable of moving through the Imperium in a carefully woven fog of falsity and misdirection. Using tiny gestures, key words and cadences, two agents can communicate vital information in the presence of others who remain none the wiser. Furthermore, using psychic and mental conditioning, a graduate of the Collegium can close his mind to all but the most destructive psychic probing, concealing his deepest secrets around a labyrinth of half truths and falsity to confuse, making them not only extraordinarily proficient spies and agents, but near-impregnable living vaults for the secrets of the Cabal.

The ultimate purpose of these Tyrantine agents is to firstly hold the Cabal above all other masters, to pursue knowledge of the Tyrant Star and to keep that knowledge safe from all outside the Cabal's jealous circle. In most cases, these goals coincide with the agent's duties as Acolytes of the Ordos Calixis. However, where their true loyalties have come into conflict with the Adepta or even immediate superiors outside of the Cabal, this has led to cold and brutal conflict with those the agent would ordinarily call their lords, comrades, or even friends. So far, the Cabal has managed to keep all such "difficulties" from wider knowledge. The time may come, though, when the fate of all is at stake and they will have to act no matter what the cost. Perhaps a civil war will erupt within the Ordos Calixis as a result. This is a nightmare, however, that this secret empire, this order within an order, must bear, for their own fearful secrets are as nothing to the dangers of the Hereticus Tenebrae, and some must be sacrificed lest its truth devour us all.

Born of Prophecy and Shadow: The Tenebrae Collegium

The birth of this shadowy brotherhood is rumored to have occurred several decades ago when Lord Inquisitor Caidin granted leave to (the then) Inquisitor Zerbe to form a special conclave within the Calixian Conclave following new understandings of the revelations of the Propheticum Hereticus Tenebrae. The formation of such an organisation was deeply unpopular amongst many in the broader Calixian Conclave who saw Zerbe raising his own base of power in the Bastion Serpentis, and feared that the inner circle of the Cabal might begin to subvert the Ordos Calixis to one man's blind obsession. Zerbe, however, had trusted the full import of the prophecy to only his closest and most trusted peers, among them the ferociously intelligent and well-respected Inquisitor Cassilda Cognos. It was her voice that swayed Lord Inquisitor Caidin to their cause. It was also she who conceived the plan to form the Tenebrae Collegium, reasoning that while the effort of all the Ordos was needed to unravel the Tyrant Star's mystery, the Cabal's inner circle would need to find their own core of allies and servants—even amongst the vassals of their obstinate comrades if needs be—to carry out their work and ward off utter disaster. So was born the Tenebrae Collegium, a brotherhood of higher purpose, and into it Cognos poured all her skill and brilliance, although she was herself only to survive just long enough to see the first wave of agents "graduate". The Tenebrae Collegium endures as memorial both lasting and terrible to her vision.

#### **Warden of the Divisio Immoralis** Warden of the Divisio Immoralis

*"Sleep well tonight. Dream the sweetest of dreams and remember their careless touch. For it will be the last peaceful sleep you will ever have."*

— Address to newly inducted Wardens by Senior Arbiter Kae Drusil.

Something festers in the fabric of the Calixis Sector, something that eats away at is foundations, deceives its people and gnaws at its sanctity. While some in high authority scorn such melodramatic conclusions, there are others who have the foresight and the will to confront this parasite of heresy and rip it out of the body of the population. This is a disease of deviant faith, a worship of false gods, corrupt ideologies and moral bankruptcy. It is spawning an epidemic of deluded citizens in its wake. It is these citizens who are the malignant flesh of this disease and it is this flesh that must be cut out. Such is the thesis of Senior Arbiter Kae Drusil. It was to combat this groundswell of recidivists, cultists and degenerates that under the authority of the Lord Sector himself, the Divisio Immoralis was founded. To some, Drusil's force is just another brutal tool of oppression built to placate the paranoia of Governor Hax and his inner circle, but to Drusil and those who follow her, they see themselves as nothing less than guardians of civilisation and order in the sector—although in practical terms the force is limited largely to Hive Sibellus itself.

#### **The Work of Diviso Immorialis**

With authorisation to pursue their investigations throughout the sector, the wardens operate alone or in pairs beyond Hive Sibellus, and pursue their own leads, sifted data and lines of enquiry. Such autonomy is the cause for some contention within the Adeptus Arbites, but it is not due to laxness on Drusil's part—as she has explained repeatedly and at length to her contemporaries—but because with so few wardens and a sector to guard, she cannot be everywhere and sign every carta personally. Likewise, their roving and ill-defined remit and poor reputation is the cause of a frequent lack of cooperation by local enforcers and even other members of the Adeptus Arbites. They are often made painfully aware of the limits of their authority. This friction can manifest in ways ranging from a simple denial of resources or by hamstringing the wardens with red tape, to the unfortunate disappearance of several wardens looking into the affairs of the Sollex Tech sect. Though they may not be well-respected, they have been proved right on several occasions; certainly their presence has prevented several atrocities and revolts from occurring in the past.

The Diviso is the child of Drusil's vision and obsession, and the task force of Adeptus Arbites all look to the greyhaired veteran as their mentor and leader. Drusil believes with total conviction that the rise in cult activity and the numbers of those turning against the Creed and law in recent years is no accident; somewhere behind the scenes a dread purpose pulls the strings to propel the sector towards some terrible dark future. Authorised and smiled on by the Lord Marshal it might be, but the Divisio has its opponents, and they are powerful.

Some Arbites within the sector see it as a needless eccentricity at best and a product of the burnt out veteran's paranoia at worst. A few see it as a deliberate overstepping of concerns that rightfully are the sole province of Ordo Hereticus and the Ministorum—just one more avenue by which Hax hopes to consolidate his power. As a result, many shield their most capable and talented officers from transfer to the task force and Drusil must make do with what she can get: eccentrics, burn-outs and the occasional promising novice. The Inquisition for their part have indulged the Diviso's existence at least for now.

That the Divisio Immoralis is comparably small and its senior is held in barely veiled contempt by the Adeptus Arbites across the sector does not detract from their remit or their fierce dedication to their appointed task. In the absence of the best-trained staff, Drusil has selected those who share her obsession. Though they may not be the toughest or most promising arbitrators, most of her "wardens" fully believe in their commander and are incredibly dedicated to the task that has fallen to them. Many have also come to believe some great and overarching moral threat seeks to envelop the sector, and they have dedicated their efforts to combating the rot they see festering at the heart of Hive Sibellus in particular. They are undoubtedly dedicated, but few are prepared for the things they must encounter, lacking the esoteric learning or defences the Inquisition enjoys.

In an echo of their mistress, many wardens are strained and brittle men and women. Hard-drinking is a common, if hidden, vice in the Divisio. Trauma-fatigue and psychological burn-outs are not uncommon in those called to serve in this specialised taskforce.

#### **Becoming a Warden of the Divisio Immoralis**

Deciding to become a Warden of the Divisio at character creation may form an excellent explanation for your induction into the Inquisition. Somewhat equipped with specialised knowledge and a concern with subtle and subversive activity, wardens make excellent Acolytes for Inquisitors of all stripes, even if they have to be "disabused" of a few of the fallacies the Divisio believes true first. If you opt to join the Divisio later in your Career, it is undoubtedly with the consent of your Inquisitor who values having a servant embedded in the Divisio to see all that passes through the taskforce's cramped offices on Scintilla.

Upon becoming a Warden of the Divisio Immoralis, you gain 1d5 Insanity points.

#### **Required Career:** Arbitrator.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 1 or higher (o xp).

You may take this Alternate Rank during character creation. This does not affect your starting Skills and Talents. It only changes where you can invest your starting xp.

### ELITE ADVANCE PACKAGES 

*"As the ancients did, I find travel narrows the mind wonderfully."*

— Lord Sector Marius Hax.

While Alternate Careers represent a fundamental shift in your direction by way of your training, goals or role, there are things that can profoundly effect the way you behave or even the fundamentals of who you are that have little or nothing to do with Career choice. It may be some conviction of belief, some strange event, or even something that has been deliberately inflicted on you. One very good way of reflecting these life-changing occurrences is by the use of Elite Advance packages. These build on the rules for Elite Advances (see sidebar for a summary of these) to allow your character to spend their xp outside their usual development found in their Career Path to gain an unusual Skill or Talent, or, in this case, a package of changes (for both good and ill). In some cases where the effects might be largely detrimental, the cost might be very low. W

Regardless of how your xp are spent, you advance through the Ranks of your Career Path normally.

There is an endless variety of Elite Advance Packages, just as there are a limitless number of potential life altering events, and indeed Elite Packages are intended for use by GMs to be something of a campaign toolbox; providing them a framework through which they can express their own creativity (fiendish or otherwise) and customise the development of their campaign and Player Characters.

There are also no hard and fast rules for creating them. It's up to the GMs own judgement as to what they should cost relative to the abilities or potential advances they grant, but bear in mind firstly that this is the 41st Millennium, a hard, harsh and dark future where nothing should be without its price. This doesn't just mean xp, but also in more direct costs to the character in terms which can be either explicit— Insanity Points, Characteristic loss or Corruption Points or more ephemeral (but no less challenging) costs such as restrictions on behaviour, in-game enemies or secret masters to whom they are beholden.

If you'd rather develop your own ideas, look to the background options shown in Chapter I and the examples that follow for ideas. Astute readers may already have noticed that the rules for Dark Pacts found in Dark Heresy offer a very similar and parallel system for accounting for unusual abilities. Elite Advance Packages should always be narrative led, this is to say they should reflect an in-game occurrence or some force, ideology, faction or event within the *Warhammer 40,000* universe of your games, not just an excuse to string together abilities a player wants that they can't normally have.

The example packages shown here represent ways of adding a new element into a Career, such as the emergence of Psychic Powers of the Nascent Psyker package, or show the aftermath of a terrible event that has befallen a character, such as the restoration of a Critically Wounded PC to life with the Cybernetic Resurrection package. The Cult of the Red Redemption package shows the potential benefits and drawbacks of belonging to the inner circle of a secret cult or society.

The use of Elite Advance Packages is of course an optional rule—as they modify and can potentially upset the balance of the character progression system, they are recommended for experienced groups.

#### **Elite Advances Rules Summary**

Your character's nature and development is broadly defined by their Career Path. However, the Advancements listed are not the sum total of all that your character could learn. Sometimes your character will be exposed to certain Skills or Talents during play or, as a result of their experience, they deliberately seek out new abilities to combat or exploit the things they encounter.

Sometimes your GM will offer you an opportunity to take an Elite Advance as a consequence of your character's actions, or developing events in-game. Sometimes these Elite Advances come with additional side effects, such as Corruption or Insanity Points, or your character becoming indebted to an NPC or part of a conspiracy.

You can also request an Elite Advance for a Skill or Talent not listed on your Advancement Scheme, but this must be reasonable and appropriate for your character and the situation they are in. To make a request you will need the following:

- Logical justification for your character to have the Elite Advance.
- An explanation for how you gained the Advance, how you got it, time taken, resources expended, etc.
- An offer of how many Experience Points or other cost you are willing to pay to gain the Advance. The further a Skill or Talent lies outside your character's normal area of expertise, the more it should cost; likewise for particularly rare or unusual knowledge.

Your GM may decide not to grant you the Elite Advance, or request a higher xp cost than that you have suggested; or impose some other counterbalancing penalty. Your GM may also rule that you need to pass a series of Tests in order to successfully learn the requested Skill or Talent. This usually ties into your explanation for how you gained the Advance.

#### **Sample Elite Advance Packages**

All of the following Elite Advance Packages include key information about the effects of the Advance, restrictions on who can take them, costs and any relevant effects.

#### **Cybernetic Resurrection**

*"He has been born again in the purity of metal and the sweet embrace of the Omnissiah's lightning. The flesh that so recently failed him is but a fleeting memory. Glory is his now, shriven of his weakness and his pain, his is the strength of unyielding iron."* — Magos Volkite Fell, speaking of the reconstructed Inquisitor Herrod.

The Magos of the Adeptus Mechanicus harbour a great many secrets and ancient and terrible arts. If their price is met, they can salvage the most ravaged body so long as the central nervous system is largely intact and the brain is serviceable. Taking a mangled, burned, but still alive carcass or even the merest threads of flesh and bio-matter, they can construct new body from the remains of the old, or even refit a servitor chassis to house the brain if needed. Less heavily damaged bodies are easier to repair, though the results are far from elegant or guaranteed.

#### **Restrictions:** None.

**Advance Cost:** 200 or 500 xp.

You must first have suffered Critical Wounds sufficient to incapacitate you permanently or have death averted through burning Fate Points. The Cult Mechanicus may also charge a price of their own, which is likely to be very high.

#### **Effects**

The effects of this Advance come in two forms dependant on the state of the body to be remade:

Cyber-Rebuild: You are repaired with sufficient replacement limbs, organs and the like to see you achieve functionality once more. The replacement parts are of Common quality unless circumstances dictate otherwise. If you are a techpriest, any previous implants are fully restored. However, the experience of the cyber-rebuild scars you deeply, imposing 1d10 Insanity Points and permanently reducing your Fellowship Characteristic by 1d10.

Full Resurrection: Of all the wonders capable by the machine-smiths, only a few Magos have the skill to perform the feat of full resurrection, and fewer still have the inclination to do it, especially at the behest of others. Assuming that such an individual can be located and their price—far beyond mere money—be met, you are reconstructed with an artificial body, organs harvested from servitor stock or vat-grown synthetics, a process that can have terrible repercussions for the mind. Survivors of this procedure are rarely stable, their personalities and motivations a mere shadow of their former selves. Upon gaining a full resurrection, apply the follow changes:

- Erase your current Strength, Toughness and Agility Characteristics and replace them with 30+2d10 for Strength, 30+2d10 for Toughness and 15+2d10 for Agility. Any previous Advances to these Characteristics are lost. Also, you may not improve these Characteristics without the assistance of a skilled Magos.
- Permanently reduce your Fate Points by 1.
- Halve your Fellowship Characteristic.
- Any Talents you have whose prerequisites you no longer meet are lost.
- Gain 10+1d10 Insanity Points and apply any lasting effects immediately.
- Gain the following Talents: Autosanguine, Prosanguine, Chem Geld, Disturbing Voice, Resistance (Cold), Resistance (Fear) and Resistance (Toxins).
- You gain an in-built rebreather.
- You gain 2 points of Armour to all Locations.
- You may no longer be healed through the use of the Medicae skill.
- You may no longer swim.
- The GM may allow further implant systems. Also, the Magos may do more than augment you; they may tamper with your mind and memories, resulting in all sorts of unexpected and unfortunate side effects.
- Finally, while you retain your approximate size and shape, you are clearly inhuman even at a glance. This may result in a variety of complications as determined by the GM.

See **Chapter V: Forge Worlds** for more information on implants and other devices of the Cult Mechanicus.

#### **The Cult of the Red Redemption** The Cult of the Red Redemption

This Elite Advance is intended to serve as a base for Acolytes who subscribe to the Redemption's violent philosophies. For characters wishing to become respected members or Redeemers themselves, see the Redemptionist Alternate Rank in Blood of Martyrs (page 64).

*"There is only one true path and that is the path of fire and pain."*

— Inquisitor Goldo, Monodomination: The Right of Man to Rule the Galaxy.

The Imperium is swollen with corruption and it must be cleansed by fire and by the weapons of the pure. Only then will it be made into a realm of piety and purity, or so at least the Cult of the Emperor's Red Redemption believes. An extreme militant cult of the Imperial Creed, they believe the only way to achieve redemption for themselves, and ultimately mankind, is to cleanse it of sinfulness. This cleansing is best achieved by fire, which leaves no trace of corruption, and by the death of the corrupt so their taint cannot spread. The Redemption justifies their purpose with a simple belief that the God-Emperor of Mankind is manifest proof of mankind's holy destiny to rule the stars. The sinfulness that is all around keeps mankind from fulfilling its density. So it is the duty of the faithful to remove the sin that holds back mankind, to remove the chains of impurity.

Crucially, the Redemption believes that three sins encompass and surpass all others. These are the sins of abomination, witchery and heresy. Abomination is sin and corruption made manifest by the distortion and corruption of the flesh into unnatural forms, generally referred to as mutation. Witchery is the ability to use unnatural powers. Heresy is refusing the truth of the Redemption or working against its holy purpose.

#### **The Calixian Redemption**

The Redemption came to Calixis long ago from far away in the Segmentum Solar, blown like seeds in the minds of pilgrims, soldiers and priests. It found fertile ground in the slums of the Scintillan underhives and took root. The extremes of the Redemption have always found toleration in certain sections of the Ecclesiarchy and it is this toleration of intolerance that allowed the Redemption to spread, as it normally does to the depths of hives, ship bilges and factory sumps where mankind toils in ignorance. From this willing base, it spread to find adherents in the middle ranks of society: the hab workers, the scribes and tithe counters who note the tides of dissolution that wash around them and feel nothing but hate. It has even penetrated the Adeptus Terra itself, where Administratum prefects tuck their unworn red robes beneath their beds and arbitrators go to sleep reciting the Ludmillan Dictates. Behind it all, many believe there are a few senior pontiffs of the Ecclesiarchy, men and women who know that the Ministorum needs to be as strong in arms as it is in faith.

Within the Holy Ordos, there are very few who directly cleave to the Redemption's creed but there are many who sympathise, even to applaud the sect's aims and methods. In particular, those of Monodominant belief are likely to see the Redemption as little more than a crude extension of their own philosophy. It is mainly these Inquisitors who employ members of the Redemption as Acolytes, trusting to their righteous hatred to guide their Acolytes' actions. Some even use the Redemption as a recruiting tool, taking those who have already realised the rewards of tolerance are treachery and betrayal.

#### **Taking the Red Redemptionist Elite Advance**

In taking this Advance, you aren't simply entering a cult but are subscribing to a fixed and narrow view of everything in the Imperium. If, for example, another player is a psyker or a mutant of any kind, you view them as a heretic and think there is only one correct response—burn them. This Career Path is best taken by Acolytes of an Inquisitor of Puritan view and preferably by Acolytes of a Monodominant or similar firebrand hardliner.

**Restrictions:** Psykers and Tech-Priests or members of any other sect, secret guild or conspiracy (such as the Moritat, the Collegium Tenebrae, etc.) are barred from this Elite Advance Package.

#### **Advance Cost:** 150 xp.

**Effect:** You gain the Flagellant and Frenzy talents, and the Secret Tongue (the Redemption) skill. You also gain the True Believer trait. Additionally, from this point on, you can spend xp on the cult based Advances shown in the table on [page 88.](#page-88-0)

#### **True Believer (Trait)**

As a true believer, you must cleave to the Ludmillan Dictates (see sidebar). Violating these dictates or acting against their teachings (even if under direct order or pain of death) causes you profound discomfort and mental stress. In such instances, you must succeed on a Willpower Test. If you fail, roll on the Shock Table in Dark Heresy (see page 233). The GM sets the Difficulty based on the severity of the breach of faith.

#### **Nascent Psyker** 

*"We are your future both bright and dark."* — The Heretic Thaylon Sol, Rogue Psyker.

A nascent psyker is a person who gives birth to a talent they never knew they had: the power to bend the warp to their will and with it, forge changes in the physical world. Such a metamorphosis is brutal and dangerous, and not only for the psyker. Untempered by training or experience, the undiluted power manifested by a nascent psyker can eclipse anything they may later wield. Slaved not to conscious will but to the capricious fears and desires of the subconscious, the nacent's power is the raw power of a new born child given the keys to godhood.

No matter what their age or position, the Imperium hunts constantly and remorselessly for nascent psykers. This is not only because the survival of the Emperor Himself depends on the sacrifice of psykers, but also because a nascent psyker is a threat of terrifying potential. Daemons and warp predators are drawn to the flailing soul-light of a nascent psyker like carrion to a fresh carcass. To such creatures, the untrained, frightened and barely in control power of a nascent psyker makes them a delightfully helpless prey whom they may toy with or consume with equal ease. Though such possibilities are a reason for the Imperium's constant vigilance for emerging psykers, it is not the only reason: the emergent powers of a nascent psyker are cause enough.

#### **Metamorphosis**

While many psykers' powers emerge during adolescence, this is not so for all. Some are born with their powers, while others can live half their lives of more before the potential within them manifests. In many cases, extreme mental or physical trauma or exposure to the power of the warp can force latent potential to the fore in people who never dreamt that they possessed any psychic ability. From the Guardsman who rends apart an enemy tank with his terror even as he cowers alone thinking his death certain, to the aged savant who wishes he never had read the small hide-bound volume, there are many ways for a hidden power to work its way into being.

To see a nascent psyker's power unbound is to see the potential of man as a god, a god of terror and pain. In many cases, the power wielded at such moments is beyond that of a trained and sanctioned psyker and often beyond reckoning. The records of the Witch Hunters detail many instances which serve to caution any who underestimate the danger posed by a nascent psyker: storms of psychic energy kilometers across, psychic shock waves strong enough to shatter plasteel and towering infernos of power are but a few of the details recorded by servants of Ordo Hereticus.

#### The Ludmillan Dictates

Archdeacon Ludmilla is the self-styled leader of the Redemption in the Calixis Sector, who has crushed those who oppose her with ruthless efficiency. To cement her spiritual ruler ship, Ludmilla released a number of dictates to which all those true and pure should adhere to:

- Red is the color of Redemption; it is the color of fire and blood.
- Do not consume narcotics, alcohol or other substances that give pleasure. They are sin given substance.•
- Do not suffer the witch to live; cast them to the fire.
- Do not suffer the mutant to live; rend their flesh apart.

#### **Dealing with Nascent Psykers as a GM**

Revealing a nascent psyker among a group of Player Characters is as exciting as it is challenging, but it is never something that the GM should spring on an unsuspecting player; since upon acquiring this Elite Advance Package is effectively a "death sentence" for the character. Instead, wait for a player to approach you about their interest in turning their character into a wellspring of potential. If you are amenable to the idea, let them, but wait for the proper time for when the powers reveal themselves. They don't just appear when a player spends the xp; they appear when there is a sufficient trigger (see following).

Once the powers have been revealed, whether or not the other PCs are aware of the fundamental change in their comrade or not, it's up to the player with this Elite Advance Package to stay alive. Keeping these powers secret from other Acolytes (a typical tactic for those in the 41st Millennium) is extremely difficult and almost always discovered and, when they are, they face death or sentencing to one of the mysterious Black Ships to find who knows what fate. Let the events unfold naturally in the game and don't use a heavy hand, either to help the psyker or to hinder. If the Acolyte shows off his powers foolishly, then bring down the hammer, but if the player takes precautions to hide this weird development, don't sabotage his efforts until he makes the fatal mistake that inevitably leads to his doom.

#### **The Effects of Extreme Stress**

Once the player opts to acquire this Elite Advance Package, he just has to wait for the proper moment. Nascent psykers have no control over when their powers first manifest and must rely on stressful experience to unleash their newfound might. Such moments might be when the character takes a large amount of Damage or endures unspeakable torture at the hands of some heretic or warp entity, but never at the player's decision.

When you deem the moment is right, go for it. It's up to you to describe the exact effects of the reveal, whether it's bleeding walls, arcs of lightning bursting from the Acolyte, or a vicious eldritch storm exploding overhead. Feel free to roll or select a Psychic Phenomena from Table 6–2 (see page 162) in Dark Heresy, or just make something up. Allow the Player Character to Test Willpower to regain some control, with a Difficulty determined by the intensity of the event, with degrees of success or failure raising or diminishing the effects as you decide.

#### **The Problem of Sanctioning**

Once it is known that a character is a nascent psyker, they must either become a rogue, dodging capture, or be sanctioned. A character's fellow Acolytes, or even their Inquisitor master, if they are Radically inclined, may help to conceal the character's emerging abilities. This may work for a time, but eventually a nascent psyker has to face being revealed. At this point, the character's only hopes of survival are to flee or to be taken by the Black Ships. In most cases, either of these choices puts the character beyond play ability in Dark Heresy. It is possible that if found strong enough, and if they survive their training, the character could return as a sanctioned Imperial psyker.

#### **Becoming a Nascent Psyker**

Almost any character may become a nascent psyker at any time. It costs nothing to do so and only requires the complete consent of your GM. Taking this Career is a not only a character changing decision, it also has a profound impact on the other players and any campaign your GM is running. Taking this Career Path most likely result in the death, possession or loss of your character to the Black Ships. However, the road to these outcomes can be a deeply enjoyable roleplaying experience, but be aware that ultimately, you doom your character.

**Restrictions:** Imperial Psykers and Tech-Priests may not select this Elite Advance Package.

**Advance Cost:** None (available at the GMs discretion), **Effect:** You gain the Nascent Power trait and you can now purchases Advances from the list below in addition to those on your Career Path.

| Advance      | Cost | Type | Prerequisites |
|--------------|------|------|---------------|
| Deceit       | 100  | S    | —             |
| Psyniscience | 100  | S    | —             |

#### **Nascent Power (Trait)**

**Restriction:** Characters with Psy Ratings can never have this Trait.

You harbour incredible and uncontrollable psychic power. At times, the power within you is so great it threatens to break reality around you. At other times, it submits to your will with ease. You gain a single random Minor Psychic Power (see Minor Powers in Chapter VI: Psychic Powers in Dark Heresy). This power never changes and you can use it automatically without making a Power Roll and without generating Psychic Phenomena. At the start of every gaming session you gain a number of Psychic Powers equal to 1d10 – your Willpower Bonus. If this results in 0 or less, you gain no powers that session. These powers are randomly chosen and can be from several Disciplines. You may use these powers automatically without making a Power Roll, but each use generates Psychic Phenomena.
