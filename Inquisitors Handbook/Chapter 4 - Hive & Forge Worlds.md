# Chapter IV: Hive & Forge Worlds

#### **Cadence "Widower" Dart Caster Device**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Widower)

A weapon of assassination that grew out of the bitter guild vendettas in Hive Magnagorsk on Fenksworld, the Widower is another unique design created by the mysterious artisan cult known as Cadence and is now perhaps their most widely known creation. Using a much more powerful version of the magnetic/las impellor found in Imperial needle weapons, the caster fires not a crystalline poison sliver, but an armour-piercing adamantine dart, fractal edged and designed to penetrate light body armour with ease. The darts are subsonic, their passage sounding only a slight hum as they speed through the air, and the weapon itself makes no flash whatsoever when fired, making it an excellent killer from the shadows.

The profile listed here assumes a standard razor-dart, although poisoned or explosive darts are not unknown. Cadence supplies the weapon with an attachable frame-stock and a long-barrelled impellor that turns it into a two-handed Basic type weapon with a base range of 150m and a weight of 4.5 kg (although its Damage, etc., remains the same.)

Razor darts are also Rare items with a base cost of 15 Thrones each.

#### **Flamers Cadence Promethium "Destroyer" Incineration Device** Flamers

#### **Class:** Pistol (Flame)

A weapon produced only to order by special commission by the artisan-masters of Cadence, the Destroyer is a highly advanced pattern of hand flamer that uses force-compression technology similar to that of a plasma weapon to create a superheated thermal-incandescent blast that burns far hotter and with greater fuel efficiency than that of a usual flamer. If the stories are to be believed, the first commissioner of this weapon was none other than the legendary Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Ark-Ashten, although this is likely to be apocryphal.

#### **Cadence Arms and Incunabula**

Although nominally a commercial enterprise, many would label Cadence as some form of secret society or even heretical tech-cult, whose services may be bought by the highest bidder. Based in the rarefied halls of Nova Castillia on Fenksworld, Cadence is also known to have offices and agents in dozens of hives and chartist vessels. Cadence offers weapons, servitors and other arcane devices of the highest order and sophistication to its private clientele (among which elements of the Holy Inquisition are whispered to number) and it is said they are able to fashion any device a buyer might desire for the right price. Certainly, many of their creations seem to "skirt the edge" of techno-heresy. Just why the Cult Mechanicus hasn't clamped down on them remains something of a mystery, and the tech-priest authorities remain curiously and firmly silent on the matter.

#### **Gas Torch Flamer**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

The "torch" or "gas-lighter", as most call it, is not strictly a weapon but an industrial tool that uses incandescent vapour to burn debris and clear the fungal growths that plague many hive duct-systems. The "gas-lighter" also serves well enough as a flamer for many low-rent hive gangs who can't afford the real thing and is frequently found in the hands of insurrectionists. The "torch" is nowhere near as effective (or stable) as a true flamer, but it is easy to procure and the wash of burning gas can still crisp flesh to cinders.

Gas torches use bulky, ill-protected canisters to carry their fuel. If an individual carrying a gas torch flamer suffers a Wounding hit to the body from the rear, there is a 50% chance that the canisters explode—treat this as a four metre blast, causing 2d10 E Damage, the wearer suffering double rolled Damage and catching fire.

#### **Tox Spray**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

The tox spray is a terrifying weapon found in the hands of the worst kind of gang scum in the most polluted hive sumps. The weapon uses an unholy mixture of highly corrosive industrial residue and toxic waste contained under high pressure, unleashed through a jury-rigged spray gun. The effects of the mixture on flesh are truly horrific and all but the best armour is little protection from the burning poison. Notoriously, the tox spray is used by the gangers of Hive Volg on Fenksworld to execute traitors and informants in the most gruesome manner possible—and without doubt there are few worse ways to die.

If the tox spray suffers a Jam (on a roll of 94–00), the weapon ruptures explosively, inflicting the weapon's damage as a two metre blast with double rolled Damage to the user.

#### **Las Weapons Civitas Pattern Laspistol** Las Weapons

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

A simple utility weapon, the Civitas is another model whose origins date back far into Imperial history. The Civitas is both somewhat bulky and inefficient (owing to lower quality components than a military-grade laspistol), but remains popular due to its ease of manufacture, longevity and simplicity of maintenance. These pistols are made on almost every major hive world for planetary defence armouries and civilian hands. Millions of these pistols are in circulation, from a simple polysteel and resin model an underhive declamator might own in hopes of defending his wares in the Tranch warrens, to a family heirloom furnished in hand-carved night corral and worn with pride by one of the sailwrights on the edgeworld of St Astrid's Fall.

#### **Sollex Pattern-IX "Death Light"**

#### **Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Made to the requirements of the Magnagorsk guilds by the Mechanicus sect of Sollex, the Death Light is an extremely powerful compact lasgun with a folding stock designed to fire high-energy blasts. These blasts, considerably stronger than a normal lasgun discharge, can easily burn through the thick insulation suits worn throughout Magnagorsk hive. Their power hungry nature, however, means Sollex guns are far less efficient than most las weapons and dangerous if overcharged.

Sollex weapons use standard power packs. However, owing to their more powerful charge they get commensurately fewer shots from them. It is possible to hotshot or overcharge Sollex weapons but it is dangerous. If this is done, they become subject to the Overheats rule. Sollex weapons have Scarce Availability in Magnogorsk and are Very Rare elsewhere.

#### **Drusus Prime Pattern Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Made in large numbers for Calixis PDF use, the Drusus Prime is in fact a local copy of the ubiquitous Ryza-M pattern lasgun made by numerous forges and manufactorums. All weapons of this type made in the Calixis Sector are named in honour of the warrior saint and bear a crude stamp of his profile on their casing. A simple charge repeater lasgun, the Drusus Prime is perhaps the most widely produced long arm in the sector, and the sheer numbers stolen from armouries and legitimately traded over the centuries make it the most likely of its type to be found in the hands of gangers, criminals and low-grade guns for hire from Scintilla to Baraspine.

#### **Khayer-Addin Duelling Las**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

A masterwork of the gunsmith's art, these weapons are handcrafted to the highest quality by the Khayer-Addin and designed around the "single shot kill", using a unique charge cartridge which is, in essence, a pre-loaded hot-shot pack. This single powerful blast is particularly effective against armoured targets and belies the pistol's elegant appearance. The duelling las holds a special reverence and place in folklore in Gunmetal City where they are known as "Valentines" in local parlance, named for a near mythical gunslinger from Metallacian history. Conversely, in some of the more rarefied climes where duelling with pistols remains popular, such as the high spires of Sibellus, some consider this class of weapon's power "unsporting" and so lethal as to take all the skill out of things (particularly if you wish to wound or maim).

The Valentine uses special single-shot cells rather than standard power packs; these cells are Rare items with a base cost of 20 Thrones each. The Valentine cannot be combined with an overcharge pack or an additional hot-shot charge.

**– Ol' Sulla, Proprietor of Hellespont Bar, Gunmetal City.**

#### **Minerva-Aegis Las Carbine**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Popular with the more notable mercenary companies and private guild armsmen, the Minerva-Aegis is a sophisticated las carbine that unusually features a high cycle-charge chamber allowing it a rapid pulse mode comparable to fully automatic fire. Fruit of the Aegis Fragment and currently produced under title to the Takara Fane of Gunmetal, the high-grade materials needed for its construction mean its cost is significantly more than more commonplace lasguns. It is an undoubted sign of discerning professionalism in a hired scummer (or aptitude in stealing from their betters), for them to be wielding a Minerva-Aegis.

#### **Takara Palatine Compact Laspistol**

Launchers

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

A superior weapon, thanks to its advanced manufacture, the Palatine loses no stopping power despite being half the size of most military model laspistols. The Palatine has been produced exclusively for the last century by the Takara Fane of Gunmetal. As popular with the Scintillan nobility as it is with hardened mercenaries, the pistol is carried mostly for personal protection (by those that can afford it), and many of the noble scions that own one seek to further embellish their weapons with intricate lacquer work and inlays of precious metals to distinguish their weapons from those of "mere tradesmen", a service the Takara also provide for the right fee.

#### **Belasco Series-S "Venom" Compact**

#### **Laspistol**

**Class:** Pistol (Las)

An unusual pattern and one befitting the treacherous reputation of its origin world, Malfi. The Venom is a highly compact laspistol designed for covert use. It takes the shape of a flat disk

that is grasped in the hand, with the short barrel-emitter projecting between the middle fingers, fired by applying pressure to a hidden trigger. Eminently concealable, the Venom is an excellent tool for murder and espionage and widely favoured both on Malfi and beyond, although it is neither as expensive nor rare as its other local rival, the infamous Mariette pistol.

Owing to its unique design, the Venom does not use standard power packs. Instead its internal power cell must be recharged between uses (via a standard port).

#### **Sollex Pattern-VII "Steel Burner" Heavy Laspistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

Produced by the enigmatic Cult Mechanicus sect of Sollex, this hugely powerful pattern of laspistol (described by some as a "lashand cannon") has rapidly garnered a lethal reputation beyond its origins on Fenksworld where it's the chosen sidearm of the guild retainers of Magnagorsk. Although offered for small-scale trade on Fenksworld, Sollex weapons are almost impossible to obtain otherwise despite the efforts of many including Belasco, Skaelen-Har and Takara to duplicate the weapon—all have failed.

Sollex weapons use standard power packs. However, owing to their more powerful charge, they get commensurately fewer shots from them. It is possible to hotshot or overcharge Sollex weapons but dangerous. If this is done they become subject to the Overheats rule. Sollex weapons have Scarce Availability in Magnogorsk and are Very Rare elsewhere.

#### **Launchers** Launchers

#### **Gorge Pattern Grenade Launcher**

#### **Class:** Basic (Launcher)

The Gorge is a simply made, single shot break-open grenade launcher. Its simplicity does not diminish its effectiveness, though, and it is also relatively compact and very reliable, facts that make it one of the most widely used squad support weapons carried by enforcers, mercenaries and PDF troopers. Thanks to its widespread availability on the black market, the Gorge is also one of the most common ways for recidivists and rebel groups to obtain weapons for insurgencies and attacks.

#### **Melta Weapons Melta Cutter** Melta Weapons

#### **Class:** Basic (Melta)

Used to cut and weld sheet metal in macro construction facilities, the melta cutter is extremely large and cumbersome and not designed as a weapon, but it takes little imagination to turn this piece of industrial equipment into an unwieldy but highly effective killer. The melta beam produced by the cutter is of a very short range but can quickly breach most sealed bulkheads and reduce a fully armoured Arbitrator to hot gas and ash with ease.

The melta cutter has a maximum range of 10 metres. It also receives no bonus to hit for firing at closer ranges than this. Melta cutters require a Strength Bonus of 4 or more to be used effectively as a weapon. Weaker characters suffer a –10 WS penalty for each point of Strength Bonus below 4.

#### **Primitive Weapons** Primitive Weapons

#### **Drive Nailer**

#### C**lass:** Basic (Primitive)

One of the first weapons to appear in the hands of heretics in a hive uprising, the drive nailer is simply a high-power nail or rivetdriving gun of the type common to the millions who toil in hive construction and reclamation crews across the Imperium. With its power setting turned up to maximum and its safety features disabled, the drive nailer can make a messy but effective weapon.

#### **Impaler**

**Class:** Heavy (Primitive)

Carried by the most slab-muscled of gang heavies and other degenerate scum, Impalers (also known as the "harpoon cannon"), as primitive as they are, can still launch a spear of metal capable of punching straight through a human body with ease. Usually made by desperate and ill-equipped hive or mutant gangs from discarded industrial springs and hightensile cable, the harpoons used are often little more than a length of metal piping with its tip ground to a wicked point. Up-hive gunslingers and enforcers may scoff at the crudity of these weapons but sometimes find that it is much harder to laugh when pinned to a wall by a metre-long spear.

A Strength Bonus of at least 4 is required to operate the mechanism to reload an Impaler.

#### **Scrap Cannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (Primitive)

For underhive gangs who cannot steal or buy more effective heavy armament, the best they can bring to a turf war is a scrap cannon. Made from a crudely reinforced length of pipe packed with black powder and rammed with nails, bolts and anything else nasty scraped from the underhive floor. Scrap cannons are hugely unwieldy and not actually very lethal. However, they look scary and make an impressively enormous bang and pyrotechnic blast when fired, added to which the ammo is more or less free!

Individuals successfully hit with a scrap cannon must Test for Pinning. Scrap cannon are Very Rare items outside of the Underhive, and have Average availability in their depths.

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **.54 Tranter Hand Cannon**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

These massive gas-operated stub automatics, sometimes mockingly referred to as a "poor man's bolter", are undoubtedly powerful but often plagued with mechanical problems and notoriously prone to jamming. This does little to alter their appeal, though, with those who like their weapons hugely menacing and capable of taking a man's head clean off in one shot. Underhive and heretek workshops, from the bowels of Infernis to the rookeries of Solomon, produce Tranter knock-offs for eager buyers, while the Belasco Deathworks production models are actually little better in terms of reliability.

Owing to their sheer ungainly size and recoil, as well as being classed as a hand cannon, unless the firer has a Strength Bonus of 4 or more, the Tranter counts as a Basic weapon and must be used with two hands. The weapon Jams on a roll of 94–00.

#### **Armageddon Pattern Autogun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

First imported to the hive factories of Calixis to supply loyalist forces in the Tranch insurrection and the massive wave of mutant uprisings in Tranch's Soot Warrens that followed, the Armageddon pattern proved itself both in the Tranch conflict and the decade of petty cult-inspired civil wars that plagued the Malfian sub in the following years. Still manufactured primarily on Malfi itself, the Armageddon is loud, lethal and uncomplicated; a heavy-hitter for an autogun, it fires large calibre solid slugs from a fifteen-round short box clip and can stand a phenomenal amount of abuse and keep firing. Since the uprisings, the Armageddon has become a staple of the arms trade in the Malfian sub and has started to make inroads into frontier areas where its stopping power and robust design rapidly gains converts.

#### **Hax-Orthlack Armsman-10 Pattern Service Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

This bulky and intimidating high-capacity stub pistol is a common sidearm for enforcers, household troops and mercenaries throughout the Calixis Sector. A copy of the traditional Scipio pattern Naval pistol, the Armsman has been mass-produced for centuries under contract to arm the Magistratum cadres of Scintilla and many other worlds. Most are manufactured with the sigil or cipher of the contracted buyer machine-stamped into their grips, and examples without such a mark (or "rogues" as they are known) are often considered unlucky by the superstitious.

#### **Scatheros "Blackhammer" Defence Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

Notorious for its sheer destructive power, the Blackhammer comprises of a carefully crafted barrel fitted to an equally well-crafted stock and firing mechanism, all constructed to safely fire a single massive shell, more than twice the size of a standard shotgun cartridge with many times the power. Each shell is custom-made and filled with dozens of heavy pellets the size of stubber rounds, backed by a huge charge; the quality of the barrel breach and stock are vital to keep the weapon from tearing itself apart with every firing. The Blackhammer itself is a rarity whose fame often precedes it. The weapon's short range and single-shot capacity are often overlooked in favour of its immense stopping power, although, like many such weapons, it can prove dramatically less effective against targets with substantial "hard" armour.

Such is the weapon's ferocious recoil it imposes an additional –10 to hit unless the firer has a Strength Bonus of 4 or more or the weapon is braced. The Blackhammer's shells count as Exotic ammunition.

#### **The Aegis Data Fragment**

A technological jewel and prize beyond price, the Aegis Data Fragment alone was, for the Adeptus Mechanicus, worth the millions that died during the Angevin Crusade. Discovered during the horrific Adranitian phase of the crusade, the technoarchaeological find, known as the "Aegis", contained templates for all manner of systems, as well as a treasure trove of other data and logos. The granted licenses for the use of the more mundane templates from Aegis helped form the basis for the fortunes of several famous houses and cartels, and their dispersal cemented the rights and properties of the Mechanicus within the fledgling power structures of the Calixis Sector. The Mechanicus has never revealed whether the Aegis Data Fragment yielded more than a few new small arms patterns, systems schematics and augur interfaces, or whether it posed further questions yet unanswered, or was merely a part of some larger undiscovered whole. It has not escaped the notice of the Ordos Calixis, though, that the Mechanicus maintains several secretive outposts bordering the Adrantis Nebula still, and it is thought that at least sixty-four known explorator expeditions have been sent into the untamed volumes of the nebula at the behest of the secretive priests of the Machine God.

#### **Westingkrup Carnodon Pattern Precision Hand Cannon**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

No mere blunt tool, the Carnodon is a finely made and well-balanced weapon, distinctly based on the internal mechanism and layout of an Imperial bolt pistol (which aside from its long barrel, it superficially resembles), it is both powerful and extremely accurate in skilled hands. A high priced and exclusive item, the ownership and ability to use a Carnodon is a mark of high status among the criminal gangs of Scintillan hives, and this superior weapon is also found in the armouries of the Adeptus Arbites and the elite Janissary Lifeguards of the powerful House Krin.

#### **Hax-Orthlack Creed-9 Autogun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

The Creed-9 is a compact autogun designed for closequarter warfare and constructed to a local variant of a long established design intended for Naval boarding troopers. Made using lightweight materials and fitted with a telescopic stock, the Creed-9 is not much larger than a military autopistol in size and is the favoured weapon for many enforcer kill squads, as well as the private armies of numerous noble houses and Chartist Captains. Because of this "elite" role, it's common to see Creeds sporting numerous upgrades and modifications such as red-dot sights, expanded mag-ports and fire selectors.

#### **Sulymann Encarmine Service**

#### **Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

A sophisticated autopistol no larger than the average compact stubber, the Encarmine sacrifices stopping power for a reduction in size and increase in clip capacity. Widely carried for personal defence and as a sidearm by "second liners" (such as plainclothes enforcers, hauler rig crews and merchants' factors), the Encarmine packs a lot of firepower into a relatively small frame. Unfortunately if faced with armoured opponents, the firer is likely to wish for something with a good deal more kick.

#### **Khayer-Addin Forge "Fate Bringer" Long Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

This elegant and perfectly balanced stub revolver is a prime example of the kind of pistol commonly used to "settle affairs of honour" among the nobles of Sibellus and their off-world imitators. Deceptively simple in design and exquisitely well-made from the finest materials, the Fate Bringer is perfectly suited to its role as a duelling piece and also makes for a good target and assassination pistol, although its lack of clip capacity and slightly ungainly size make it a poor choice for real combat in the eyes of some.

#### **Fykos Forge "Flametongue" Howdah Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

The Fykos Forge of Gunmetal is a prestigious clan of master gunsmiths who specialise in elaborate and finely made hunting weapons, and the Flametongue is no different. This simple and reliable weapon is a compact twin-barrelled hand cannon, chambered to fire huge, custom-made soft alloy rounds that break apart on impact to cause horrific wounds. Intended as a powerful last line of defence should a hunter be ambushed or have the tables turned on him, anything that can't be put down with the Flametongue's twin shots you probably shouldn't have been hunting anyway.

Flametongue rounds count as Exotic ammunition with the Primitive quality.

#### **Hack Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Known by a wide variety of nicknames on different worlds, this is a conventional double-barrel shotgun, cut down to the smallest possible size and rigged to fire both of its barrels at once from a single trigger pull. Although very short-ranged and hardly a precision weapon, the twin blast is still devastating against "soft targets" (such as unarmoured civilians), and the sight of one can have a very salutary effect on bystanders. A Hack is no substitute for a true combat weapon though, as many a ganger faced with carapace-armoured enforcers has found to their cost.

Although it only fires a single blast, it uses two shotgun shells at once (if loaded with a single shell it only inflicts 1d10+4 Damage without the Tearing ability).

#### **Hecuter 9/5 Heavy Combat Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Often regarded with some justification as a "prince among pistols", the Hecuter manufactured by the Orthlack of Gunmetal is actually a copy of a famed out-sector design, whose pattern was awarded as part of some long-forgotten trade war. A firm favourite among Metallican gunslingers and Malfian bloodsworn, the weapon is tooled and balanced to exact tolerances, making it quite controllable despite its large calibre for an autopistol. The Hecuter's clip projects somewhat from the angled grip, giving the weapon a distinctive profile, while despite its size, its excellent design makes it an "easy carry" from shoulder rigs and quick-draw holsters.

**Hecutor 9/5 Heavy Combat Autopistol**

#### **Mariette Cylinder Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Named for the Malfian noble house said to have originated the design—or at least first championed its use within their assassin cadre, the Mariette is an extremely concealable compact stub pistol crafted from polyflex and ceramics with no metallic or powered components. Its four-chamber barrels are self-contained and the whole pistol is designed to easily break down into a handful of small parts. Disassembled, the Mariette can be easily concealed about the person or inside some innocuous object (such as a lamp or data-slate) with almost no chance of detection and be re-assembled to fire in mere seconds.

The Mariette when disassembled and hidden is virtually impossible to find (–30 penalty on Search Tests) as the parts don't show up on scanners or auspexes as weapons. The ammunition-barrel cylinders for the Mariette are themselves Rare items and cost a base price of 100 Thrones each.

#### **Volg "Meat Hammer" Scattergun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

While shotguns can make for brutally effective weapons, the gangers of Volg have created an even more savage variation to stamp their authority on those that dare to cross them. The "meat hammer" (so-named for its tendency to turn flesh into unrecognisable chunks), is a specially constructed, triple-barrelled, open choke shotgun that can all but destroy a living body with a single blast. Usually fired from point-blank range, a meat hammer hit is intended to kill, obliterate and to discourage others, and is a particularly loud and messy way to die.

Although the meat hammer has a clip of "1" listed, it actually takes three shotgun shells to load.

#### **Volg Mercy Killer**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

So named because it's a "mercy if it kills what you're aiming at", this weapon exemplifies any number of crude, often scratch-built handguns used by the desperate and oppressed across the realm of mankind. Fashioned from whatever materials are to hand, these single-shot stub pistols are wildly inaccurate and often as dangerous to the firer as the target. In Hive Volg however, the provision of Mercy Killers has gone somewhat further than enterprising criminals bodging up home-brewed pistols, and the "higher powers" of Fenksworld manufacture Mercy Killers en-masse as part of their drive to arm the Volgites as inexpensively as possible. Indeed, a Mercy Killer and a handful of bullets cost less in Volg than a trencher of parboiled murk fungus to eat and a demi-litre of recyk water to wash it down with.

If a Mercy Killer suffers a Jam result, roll 1d10. If the result is "9" the pistol explodes, inflicting its Damage on the firer and destroying the gun.

#### **Fykos Forge "Nomad" Hunting Instrument**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

Possibly the most famous weapon Gunmetal produces, the Nomad well deserves its superlative reputation. The designs for the instrument are said to be the work of Angevin's personal gunsmith, who in turn held them from an ancient line that could be traced back to ancient times on Holy Terra itself. Whatever the truth of that somewhat fanciful accolade, the Fane of Fykos makes only perhaps ten Nomads to commission every standard year, and each is in some way different and personalised to the purchaser, be it the grinding pattern of the trigger or the choice of material for the stock. Such perfect workmanship combined with the capability to empty a carnosaur's brainpan at two miles, they say, makes it worth every Throne.

#### **Phobos Stubber**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Found across the length and breadth of the Imperium and no doubt predating its founding in design, these cheap stub automatics are turned out locally in the tens of thousands by both the Fane of Doru in Gunmetal City and by the Belasco Deathworks on Malfi (where it is known as a "rake" in local parlance) and exported across the sector. This commonplace pistol can be found everywhere from the stalls of underhive scav-traders, to frontier mining camps and Administratum supply depots (where it goes by the nickname of the "Sigma-9", after the opening code-line of the relevant requisitioning forms needed for an adept to get hold of one).

#### **Arms and the Imperial Citizen**

The Imperium is a universally militarised culture, beset from without and within. Throughout its history, weapons and warfare, or at least the fear of conflict, is omnipresent for most. On many worlds the carrying of arms is an accepted part of life and, despite the efforts of some paranoid planetary governors, there are often too many weapons in circulation to enforce control. This is particularly the case on hive worlds as many are centres not only for arms production but also for the mass storage of weapons; a hive that cannot arm at least a core of its massive population in a crisis or invasion would be found wanting in the eyes of the High Lords of Terra, and its rulers soon replaced. In order to retain some measure of control, however, in most hives the powers-that-be impose heavy taxes on the legitimate sale of weapons and other arms among the public. This tends to have a polarizing effect—placing arms in the hands of the wealthy and a hard core of professionals (be they bodyguards, duellists, mercenaries and the like), and of course criminals and underhivers who resort to the thriving black market trade in weaponry simply to survive.

#### **Hax-Orthlack Puritan-14 Execution Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

The Puritan is a squat dual-barrelled autopistol with an integral single shotgun cartridge chamber. An ugly weapon whose appearance signals its brutal purpose very well, the Puritan is designed for use by covert kill-squads and produced in small quantities both for the Adeptus Arbites and the elite Magistratum "Crimson Sashes" of Sibellus, (although a few copies have found their way into the black market as well). The Puritan may fire either as an autopistol or as a shotgun, but not both at once. If used as a shotgun, it imposes a –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests if not used with two hands.

#### **The Fanes and Forges of Gunmetal**

Gunmetal City on Scintilla is justly the most famed, respected and commercially powerful provider of arms and munitions in the entire Calixis Sector. The city's industry and culture revolves around weapons at all levels and the city's lawless and violent reputation is largely the result of the fact that any man or woman's worth in Gunmetal is largely decided by whether they are wiling to defend what's theirs with blood and bullets.

Most of Gunmetal's famous weapons are produced and controlled under the auspices of loose manufacturing cartelcombines known as "fanes", with membership of these fanes crossing all social strata from the highest armsmaster to lowliest unskilled labourer, with only a rare few strong enough or desperate enough to court independence outside of them. Being part of a fane is elective rather than an accident of birth (although familial and local tradition do hold great sway), and a Metallican may shift their oath and their allegiance between fanes or even go independent, although these matters are never taken lightly. As well as being a territorial structure and a commercial power, the fane also has a spiritual and techno-arcane dimension, and each has, at its heart, a great temple of arms at the centre of which is the high altar on which the fane's master-archetypes and weapons of legend are laid in reliquaries exalting the power of the gun. The fanes paradoxically offer some small measure of stability and protection for their members, and at the same time drive much of the city's conflict with their rivalries and trade-wars. Some fanes even act as covert backers of the infamously savage and well-armed gangs and gun-clans of the Infernis—Gunmetal's notoriously deadly underhive.

There are scores of different fanes and smaller independent "forges" on Gunmetal, all vying for prestige, money and power in a shifting quagmire of loose alliances and bloody feuds. Here is a sampling:

**The Fane of Doru:** While possessing a great deal of money and resources, the fane of Doru garners little respect or influence among its peers. Regarded by the rest as "artless panel beaters and skulking cowards", Doru is seen as little more than a front for the Skaelen-Har Hegemony, and they face an uphill struggle to consolidate or expand their power in the hive, (they are continuously beset on all sides by backstabbing and petty indignities). In terms of arms, the Doru is largely limited to the mass-production of PDF patterns, generic spares and ammo.

**The Forge of Fykos:** Perhaps the most famous and wealthy of the Metallican independents, the Fykos dynasty has supplied the elite of the Calixis Sector with the most potent and exclusive of hunting weapons and arms for centuries. Many on Gunmetal regard them as dangerously arrogant and insufferably effete.

**The Forge of Khayer-Addin:** The family of Khayer-Addin are reputedly of fallen Rogue Trader stock and their family forge has provided master-gunsmiths for five generations. They specialise in one-off commissions, duelling pieces and a variety of artfully disguised guns and blades. To the Scintillan nobility, a Khayer-Addin weapon is a highly desirable item, often an exquisite and ornate work of art whose lethality is rarely exceeded.

**The Fane of Orthlack:** Allied to the ascendant power of House Hax of Sibellus, the Fane of Orthlack hold the ironclad contracts to arm the Scintillan Magistratum and the enforcer cadres of many other worlds. Old, powerful and influential, the Orthlack are among the most conservative of the great fanes and arguably the strongest.

**The Fane of Takara:** A rising power, the Takara are creators of superior las weapons of all types. They have strong Cult Mechanicus ties and recently fought off a takeover by the Fane of Doru, forcing a radical reassessment of their power and influence by others in the Metallican hierarchy.

**The Fane of Westingkrup:** A powerful and aggressive fane, and one with a long history of survival despite the odds, Westingkrup specialises in revolvers, hand cannon, shotguns and other "low tech/high-quality" arms with a just reputation for crafting robust, no-nonsense weapons. Westingkrup is also infamous for the number of regulators and gunslingers it routinely employs and its willingness to go to war over the slightest provocation.

#### **Volg "Ripper Clip" Autopistol Class:** Pistol (SP)

Known locally as the "zip gun" or "chopper", this bulky autopistol is purposely designed to be a cheap as possible to manufacture and maintain. Rather than caseless ammo, the Ripper Clip uses basic stub rounds and the weapon itself is made from industrial spares and crude pressed metal parts. A further eccentricity of its design is its loading mechanism, a vertical strip of bullets wrenched through the autopistol as it fires (a feature copied from a common rivet gun). This unusual arrangement creates a distinctively loud banging-rattle when used, often ending with a clatter as the spent strip hits the floor—unfortunately advertising that the user is out of ammo! Despite the gun's many shortcomings there's no shortage of buyers on Volg, where any extra firepower you can lay your hands on might keep your corpse from the meat-sumps just a little longer.

Ripper Clips have a Common Availability on Volg and are Scarce elsewhere.

#### **Sulymann Holdout "Salvation"**

#### **Auto**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

An extremely compact handgun, (small enough to fit comfortably in a waistcoat pocket or lady's purse), the Salvation is designed as a personal defence item for merchants, adepts and affluent citizens untrained in weapons as the pistol is entirely self-contained and very easy to use. Intended only for use in emergencies, the Salvation's internal magazine rounds cannot actually be reloaded without partly dismantling the pistol first, giving it a reputation as little more than a "disposable toy".

#### **Westingkrup Model 20 "Scalptaker" Stub Revolver**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

An enviable example of robust and utilitarian design, the Scalptaker is a fantastically reliable pistol, firing true after almost any amount of abuse and mistreatment. This fact is not lost on professional fighters, frightened hivers and frontier colonists alike, who often choose the Scalptaker as a backup sidearm over more powerful pistols for this very reason. However, in the depths of the Infernis on Gunmetal, where the Scalptaker is made, the average ganger seeks to carry almost anything else, as its ubiquity brands it a "hab-proles" gun in their eyes and an object of some quite unfounded derision.

#### **Westingkrup "Slayer" Pump**

#### **Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

The Slayer is a classically functional design from the Westingkrup Fane intended to be a back-up weapon for vehicle crews and PDF troopers, but is now common across Calixis. Endlessly copied with minor variants on the design and fittings to its compact, stockless frame, it is said that almost as many of these weapons make their way into the hands of deep-hive scum as are supplied to the Munitorium. One unusual variant of the Slayer, known in the local cant as the "Bonefinger", is crafted from heat-resistant ceramics and scrimshaw. These are used in the hunting of dangerous Scoldbats in the burning heat of the upper reaches of Hive Tarsus, where a standard weapon might warp and fail in the extreme conditions.

#### **Cadence "Spectre" Assault Device**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

One of the few widely known weapons produced by Cadence. Technically, the Spectre Assault Device is an autogun and chambered to standard caseless rounds. However, the Spectre is far more than a mere "standard" rifle. Featuring a tri-mag shot selection system, it not only has a huge capacity of fire, but the flexibility of freely switching between multiple loads. Beneath the blocky barrel-shroud, the Spectre also mounts an integral shotgun unit giving the user even more options for dealing death and a hidden heavy punch. The weapon still has its detractors who consider it a "poor cousin" in comparison to the raw firepower of a bolter or hellgun.

The Spectre may fire either as an autogun or shotgun, but not both during the same Action. The Spectre has three magazines and has a fire selector.

#### **Steadholder Lever Gun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

Made in millions by the Fane of Westingkrup (and copied by a dozen lesser sources), the Steadholder is a heavy calibre rifle, loaded by a simple and distinctive lever mechanism. The Steadholder may not be the finest or most famed weapon to come from the forges of Gunmetal, but it is all that stands between starvation and an unpleasant death on the margins of many a world and justly respected for that. Although mainly intended for frontier settlements and agri-worlds, many Steadholders spill onto the black markets of the worlds where they are manufactured, ending up in the hands of gangs and low-rent hired guns. Considerable numbers have found their way into the hands of Redemptionists where the gun's ease of use and low cost make it suitable for fresh and untrained converts to the cause. These so called "saviour guns", often rippling with prayer parchments and votive tokens, have sent many a soul unwillingly to the Emperor.

#### **Stormchild Hand Cannon**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Another venerable and proven design, the Stormchild is essentially a scaled-up stub revolver with a hinged breach and a five shot cylinder. A heavyweight by any standards, the Stormchild is fully capable of demolishing armoured targets and a well-placed shot from one can even cripple civilian vehicles. What's more, the weapon is huge, loud and intimidating to boot. No wonder the Stormchild finds a particular home in the hands of many gang heavies, bounty hunters and hired guns. The Stormchild and numerous near identical weapons, such as the "Saint Varnae's Wrath" boarding pistol and the Scatheros-16 "Blackheart", are produced sectorwide from a variety of forges and makers. The Stormchild's size, weight and robust construction allows it to be used as a club in close combat without damaging the weapon.

#### **The Nightmare Hives of Fenksworld**

To most outsiders, Fenksworld has a reputation as a grimy, roughshod place, a hive world that, while notoriously independent in sector politics, is seen as lacking the significance or sheer size of the likes of Scintilla or Malfi. The truth of the matter is that Fenksworld's independence and measure of self-sufficiency is bought at a price, and its bustling façade hides a number of dark secrets.

The Fenksworld that most outsiders see is Nova Castillia—a vast towering edifice of sky-piercing spires and busy supply depots, noble enclaves, covered hab-stacks and bustling neon-lit entertainment 'burgs. Although a little ramshackle and dirty, it is not unlike many other hives across the Imperium. While Castillia houses much the planet's famously mercurial ruling elite and the bulk of the planet's population, what is not widely realised is that it also holds two subordinate hives in a merciless grip to ensure this position, hives that most off-worlders, if they are fortunate, never see.

The first, Magnagorsk, sinks deep into Fenksworld's crust. Heavily industrialised, it is a hellish place of molten metal and volcanic fires, where warship armour is forged and poisonous ash fumes the air. The hive exists purely to serve the Battlefleet Calixis port anchorage in high orbit. The conditions are so harsh that a native of Gunmetal City or the Lathes might count themselves fortunate on seeing them. Magnagorsk is controlled by the fractious and pitiless foundry guilds. To them labour and metal are only coins of the realm, and one guild master would think nothing of sabotaging or murdering their rivals, or kidnapping entire work gangs to help meet their production quotas. Life is cheap in Magnagorsk, violence commonplace and death and maiming everyday hazards, but the helots that toil thanklessly there know that it could be worse; they could be exiled to Volg…

Rather than towering above or delving into the earth, Volg sprawls for hundreds of square kilometres like a vast cancer of corroded gantries and phosphor-lit domes that have spread over Fenksworld's acidic salt-fens. The sprawl itself is made up of vast moisture-traps, reprocessing plants, waste-biomass recycling reservoirs and the mad clusters of stilt-supported shantytowns that cling to them. The simple truth is without these facilities' output, famine, pollution and poisoned water would destroy Fenksworld in a few short years—the toil of millions is needed to keep billions more alive. Named by some as the vilest and most misbegotten place in the whole Calixis Sector, the toxicity and terrible conditions in Volg are on the very limit of human survivability. Matters are made worse by Fenksworld's many unutterably lethal and horribly mutated native creatures.

Volg was initially set up as a vast open penal colony for Fenksworld and the surrounding sub-sector, and the inmates were left to found their own societies and to make what they could of their lives—so long as clean water and protein flowed up-hive to where it was needed. Control was further maintained through the trade in cheap arms and vital supplies, and it transpired that Volg's population was mostly too occupied trying to survive to attempt escape or plot revolt. Over the centuries Volg, to the surprise of many, prospered and became a hive in its own right with a population in the tens of millions. While new inmates (or "clean meat" as they are known in local parlance) are sentenced to exile there still, the majority of its inhabitants are now freeborn, some "six generations in the Volg" and free to leave—if they can afford the exorbitant passage out. Life in Volg is violent, anarchic, blighted and often very brief, but as for the Volgites themselves, they are born survivors. Few death worlds breed hardier or more ruthless fighters.

#### **Talon Mark III Short Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Another common Imperial pattern, manufactured to a high standard by the Fane of Sulymann in Gunmetal (along with several other makers), the Talon is a medium calibre, fullyautomatic caseless cartridge pistol of a sturdy and practical design. Easily maintained, capable of laying down a hail of fire and handy enough to be easily used in confined spaces, autopistols such as the Talon are very popular for hive warfare and used extensively by enforcers and scum alike.

Like most military autopistols, the Talon may also use an extended 30 round clip, but if this is the case, it may not be holstered and must be fired two-handed or the weapon imposes a further –10 penalty to Ballistic Skill Tests.

#### **Volg VI "Crank Cannon" Heavy Stubber**

**Class:** Heavy (SP) The Volg VI has one simple virtue—its ease of manufacture. The "Crank Cannon" uses cheaply prefabricated parts and standard heavy stubber ammo. Its firing mechanism is purely hand-powered, the firer literally cranking the firing handle to grind the ammo belts through the breach and rotate the weapon's quad barrels. Originally produced as an inexpensive and

mechanically simple weapon to defend against Hive Volg's many treacherous forms of wildlife, the "Big-Six", as it is also known, has proved to be a great success despite its drawbacks. The weapon is produced in huge numbers on Fenksworld and exported to cheaply supply low-grade PDF forces and the private arms market across the sector. A real brute to use, especially for long periods, it's unsurprising that "Crank" gunners are often marked by massively overdeveloped right arms.

#### **Choke Gas**

A particularly indiscriminate and potentially lethal weapon designed for crowd control and riot dispersal, choke gas contains a powerful irritant that attacks the eyes and respiratory system. A few lungfulls of the thick bluish gas can reduce the most ardent of mobs to a sobbing, coughing morass. Despite its undoubted effectiveness, choke gas is not a weapon of first choice for the Adeptus Arbites and is usually relegated to heavy raids or serious civil crackdowns, as it has a tendency to spread through the air filtration systems common to many hives, and is powerful enough to kill or seriously harm those of weak constitution.

Each Turn that a character is caught in the blast radius of choke gas, they must Test Toughness. A failed Test indicates the victim gains a level of Fatigue (multiple Rounds are cumulative). The harmful effects of choke gas last while the character is in the blast area plus 1d10 Rounds. If a victim of choke gas fails the Test by four or more degrees, they also reduce their Toughness Characteristic by 1d10 for 1d5–1 hours. Choke gas clouds linger for 1d5 × 3 minutes. Choke gas comes in the form of canister grenades and as launcher rounds.

The confines and dense crowds of a hive make weapons such as frag grenades perfectly suited to sowing terror and destruction there. For this reason anti-personnel devices are usually heavily proscribed, but that doesn't stop the more inventive criminal scum from fashioning their own. The nail bomb presented here is an explosive charge packed around with rusted nails, metal spoil, crushed glass and other assorted nastiness, all packed into a convenient length of pipe or an old food canister and fitted with a home-made fuse that hopefully is reliable enough not to kill the user.

#### **Riot, Revolt and Calamity**

That any civilisation is "three missed meals away from anarchy" is an adage that has held true since long before the Imperium and applies doubly in the case of a hive world. In any given hive, millions must live together in jostling proximity, utterly dependant on a complex and gargantuan infrastructure for the mere basics of daily life such as food, power, light and even clean air. If widespread rioting, unrest or serious disorder is allowed to ferment it is possible that the threads binding the hive together may be broken—and millions may suffer as a result. It is said by some that this is one reason why the phenomena of the "underhive" is allowed to exist in some form or another on most hive worlds, as a vital sinkhole for the city's malice, sin and discord.

Despite unceasing vigilance and totalitarian control, catastrophic unrest does sometimes occur in even the most tightly ordered of hives, and the history of the Calixis Sector is littered with such calamities: Fenksworld's infamous Tyburn food-tax riots saw Volg's population almost double inside a year (before natural attrition reduced it again in the following few months), while the two-decade long period of petty revolts and near civil anarchy caused by the misrule of House Koba on Malfi left near a billion dead and saw the final ruination of what had been one of the most powerful noble families in the sector. In more recent times even the mighty and prosperous Hive Sibellus has not proved to be immune. When heavy-handed Magistratum tactics stirred up a hornet's nest of trouble during what came to be known as the "Reinholt Blackouts", open warfare broke out between the Magistratum and criminal gangs, spilling over from the slums and no-go zones into the hive's infrastructure. Power was cut to several dozen middle-hive districts for days—fear and anarchy took hold and tens of thousands died, with whole regions gutted by raging fires. Many sections of the hive, damaged by the blackouts, remain as burnt-out ruins, collapsing into the underhive; they are now the haunt of dregs and worse. Also as a consequence of the rioting and thanks to their loss of face and perceived failure, the Sibellus Magistratum has become even more brutal in the execution of their duties.

*"Life's mysteries are all but ripples in the steel."*

— Landrian proverb.

The many and varied ranged weapons employed on hive worlds are matched by the hand weapons used by their populations. The tight confines and cramped quarters often mean that a hand-held weapon is preferred. Selections included here include Primitive, Chain and Power weapons. T

#### **Bolo Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Owing its origins to the time long ago when the hive world of Malfi was once largely covered in dense jungle, the bolo is a heavy single-edged cutting tool that for centuries has doubled as a brutally effective weapon. Crafted from mono-serrated plexsteel, the average bolo has a distinctive 40 centimetre long, inwardly curving blade that widens somewhat before the tip. This shape makes the bolo perfect for heavy slashing blows and, in skilled hands, it can lop-off limbs or open-up a man gut to gullet in a single stroke. Still used on Malfi as an everyday tool, it retains a murderous reputation and a favoured place in local folklore. The bolo is also favoured as a gang weapon among Malfi's jacker-gangs and dacoits, who traditionally mark noteworthy kills and exploits by acid-etching their blades with crude murder-glyphs known as "gris".

The weapon has Common Availability on Malfi and is Rare elsewhere.

#### **Chain Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Chain)

The chain knife works on the same principle as its larger kin: the chain sword. It often appears similar to a short cleaver or wide dirk, with a squat and murderous look to it. Powered by a compact cell in the hilt, the weapon's buzzing teeth rip through flesh with ease and splatter onlookers with hot gore. Chain knives, also known variously as "buzz blades" and "chain rippers", are almost entirely a hive-bound weapon and common from the infamous shredder gangs of the Sibellian underhive to the fighting cages of Malfi. On Landunder, the buzz blade is famously the province of the labour gangs that control the docking airlocks of the eight cities, notorious as they are for quelling dissent with a single ragged cut to the belly, the art of which is to leave the victim screaming as long as possible before death.

#### **"Devil's Kiss" Landrian Stiletto**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The Devil's Kiss is a long narrow blade that is quenched in blood during forging and sharpened only along the last five centimetres, leading to the needle-like tip. In the cities of Landunder, the Devil's Kiss is also the name of a blade clan notorious for quiet and subtle killing, their victims bleeding out from a single, almost invisible, puncture wound. It is said that unless you are learning the fatal tricks of the clan, you will never see this deadly blade except with your own blood wetting it.

#### **"Emperor's Whisper" Landrian Blade**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The Emperor's Whisper is the blade carried by members of the powerful Tithe Guild—the powerbrokers of the eightfold cities. Crafted from ceramics and unique alloys, the result they say is "as sharp as sin". Each is a deadly work of art, capable of slicing a hand off with a single blow and punching easily through light armour. On Landunder, the Whisper blade is more than simply a weapon; it is a badge of office and a sign of great status. To be gifted with a Whisper blade, if you are not of the Landrian Tithe Guild, is viewed as an incredible honour.

#### **The Blades of Landunder**

The crust of Landunder floats on a toxic chemical sea, shifting over the planet's surface at the whim of the undersea's deep tides. On the underside of that crust cling eight great cities, their armoured shells covered by intake vents, portals and docking bays like ancient organic growths. By ancient accord, no citizen of Landunder is permitted to carry a firearm because of the danger they pose to the structure of the city itself. Over the generations, the use of blades has become universal and this world has birthed some of the greatest knife-fighters in Calixian history. Their weapons (known to outsiders as "Landrian blades") have become so much a part of the culture of the world that the guilds, crews and gangs of the eightfold cities are each separated and distinguished by the blades they favour. Each has a highly developed art of wielding their chosen blade and, from the highest born satrap to the lowest chem-scummer, everyone who lives in Landunder does so with a knife less than a sudden gesture away. It is rare indeed for a Landrian child of either sex to pass to adulthood without at least one good scar (and usually more than that) to prove their honour. Tales of the Landrian blades and the skill of their wielders has spread throughout the Calixis Sector, and wealthy collectors on Scintilla often pay large sums for "blooded" blades of good provenance.

#### **Magistratum Chastisement "Punisher" Baton**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A byword for brutality on Scintilla, this heavy baton is not intended to incapacitate or capture but rather to smash limbs, crack skulls and wantonly crush any resistance with overwhelming force. The baton is a polymer sheathed, metre-long rod of strengthened plasteel with a hollow core part-filled with a dense liquid metal alloy to augment the force of blows struck with it. These weapons are widely carried by many enforcer cadres as a cheap and effective alternative to shock weapons, and many also find their way into "private" hands where they command equal fear.

#### **Render, Landrian**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Considered a cursed and ill-omened blade on Landunder for its dark history, the Render was created to take its victim apart slowly, piece by painful piece. A butcher-blade as long as man's forearm, its double cutting edges are covered with dozens of intricate serrations and hooks to maximise the victim's suffering and blood loss. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Render clan, nominally meat-mongers and tanners, have been repeatedly linked with murder cults and the worst criminal atrocities, and of all the Landrian clans they have the most sadistic and sinister reputation.

#### **The Khayer-Addin "Serpentine"**

#### **Power Blade**

**Class:** Melee (Power)

Although blade weapons concealed in walking canes, rods of office and even umbrellas are far from uncommon among the Calixis Sector's rich and powerful, few such weapons are as potent or as exclusive as the Serpentine. A thin rapier-like blade of the highest quality adamantine alloys and equipped with a miniaturised disruption field generator of great sophistication, it is a lightweight weapon and potentially devastating "surprise" for the unwary. Serpentines are custom made by commission and most take the form of elaborately carved walking sticks that disguise the weapon's nature until activated. Famously, the notorious duellist and libertine, the Marchioness Alyssa Marque, formerly of House Llahst, is said to have a Serpentine variant concealed in the form of an exquisite lady's fan that springs into lethal shape when triggered.

#### **Landrian "Sigilite" Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Named after a half-forgotten holy figure from a time long past, the Sigilite is a curious weapon wielded by the gelt-brokers of Landunder, (it is they who barter the price with crystal miners for the load yielded from the deepsea mineral chimneys). Traditionally a defensive weapon intended to protect the broker from robbery, the weapon is formed outlandishly from a set of intersecting steel crescents, sharpened along their edges, tapering-off to wicked points. The blade's curious shape, combined with the twirls and circling passes of the gelt brokers knife-work, allows it to deflect incoming blows before delivering savage raking counter-attacks.

# ARMOUR Armour

<span id="page-125-0"></span>*"To fail is to be flesh, only metal endures."* — On Mortality, Vol. XII-ΩΩ, Archmagos Paracelsus.

Most forms of armour, from primitive hides and scraps of metal to carapace armour worn by the PDF and military forces, can be found on nearly any hive world. The following armours are noted for originating from hive worlds in the Calixis Sector and include a new category of armour: Advanced Armour. M

Advanced Armour covers all forms of high-tech protective gear that does not fall into the four traditional types of Imperial armour: Mesh, Flak, Carapace or Power. This is usually because they are either developed for a special purpose or are made from rare materials that prohibit mass production. Advanced Armour has no special advantages or disadvantages.

**Hardened Body Glove**

#### **Hardened Body Glove**

Intended as a covert form of personal armour, the hardened body glove comprises a form-fitting suit made up of a flexible mesh fibre material that tenses when struck to disperse the impact. Additionally, the suit is also reinforced with a micro-scale insert of hardened ceramic lamellar plating over vital areas. Wearable under other loose or specially tailored clothing, hardened body gloves are a common choice for elite troops engaged in covert operations, bodyguards and anyone who wishes to protect themselves without an overt show of doing so.

For three times the listed cost, hardened body gloves can also be purchased with a sealable hood (covering the head) and inherent stealth features, making the wearer harder to detect with auspexes, IR vision and the like (imposing a –20 penalty on Tests to notice the wearer).

#### **Volcanis Shroud**

The shroud is the common name for an integrated suit of heavy protective gear including a temperature-insulating under-suit and a heavy, hooded blast coat of polymer and ceramite-alloy weave. The shroud takes it name from the vast magma-fed forges of Volcanis deep beneath the surface of Mars, and has long been a staple of heavy industrial hives and forge world gear, not least in Magnagorsk on Fenksworld where it is the universal garb of the foundry guilders, though it finds equal use in the industrial vaults of Gunmetal City and Ambulon.

The protection provided by the shroud is doubled against fire, acids and corrosives. Unfortunately, because of its substantial bulk, the shroud also imposes a –10 penalty on Agility Tests while worn. The suit also has a built-in rebreather and photo-visor.

#### **Mirker's Greaves**

These rather unusual forms of leg wear and boots are common in one form or another to the ill-fortuned (but often well-paid) men and women who are sent to hunt vermin and clear debris in the thousands upon thousands of kilometres of sewer and drainage systems that riddle a hive city. The blind, rancid things encountered in these sumps are usually more than capable of biting (or even burning) though most fabrics, and mirker's greaves are usually reinforced with polyflex and metal plate, and often razored or studded for good measure. Although used in nearly every hive city to some extent, they are unsurprisingly widespread daily wear on Volg.

The wearer can also kick with the same effect as if they were punching using knuckle dusters.

#### <span id="page-126-0"></span>**Hax-Orthlack MKII Magistratum Combat Carapace**

Produced by Hax-Orthlack for the Lord Governor's Magistratum enforcers, this suit of light articulated carapace is fully enclosed and features both a respirator and flash reactive eyepieces built into the helm. While most commonly encountered in the unforgiving grey-steel of the Scintilla Magistratum, Hax-Orthlack also produces this armour for the authorities of several other worlds in the sector, and a small number also find their way into the hands of the private retinues of powerful houses.

The suit of armour also has a built-in respirator, commbead and photo-visor.

> **Hax-Orthlack MKII Magistratum Combat Crapace**

*"We are doomed often to be caught unprepared by life. Personally I choose to insult fate by trying anyway…"*

— Olmen Zaryhk, gentlemen thief.

I n addition to arms and armour, the following items are particular to hive worlds, being used by indigenous populations to survive in the often harsh environment of the sprawling hives. I

#### **Axe-Rake**

A heavy multi-purpose tool, common to hive smelteries, foundries and work crews. The axe-rake is taken almost universally to symbolise labour and the manual workforce of the hive in the Calixis Sector. The axe-rake is frequently rendered as an icon both in industrial architecture and guild livery on most hive worlds. The genuine article can also make for a handy weapon in skilled hands.

The axe-rake grants a +10 bonus to Climb Tests, as well as on Tests made to force doors or locks open. It can also be used as a melee weapon, dealing 1d10+2 I or R Damage with the Primitive and Unbalanced qualities.

#### **Cognomen**

"Cognomen" is the official Administratum designation in the Calixis Sector for a hiver's identity card. In a hive, it is one of the only viable means of tracking, taxing and identifying the citizenry. Cognomen are usually blank iron-grey, punched-metal squares (about the size and shape of a playing card) and designed to be read by data-slates and cogitator systems. The only feature on the face of a Cognomen is the symbol of the issuing hive, guild or Adepta whom the citizen serves. In some ways, ownership of a cognomen is frighteningly important: it represents the only legal proof of identity, a right to work and even to be fed and housed for the average mid-hiver. Its loss might genuinely mean starvation, abandonment, arrest or even being cast down into the underhive in the blind face of Imperial bureaucracy. There is, of course, a thriving trade in the theft and falsification of cognomen, the price for a "face" varies on the identity fabricated or stolen, and can range from a few gelt to thousands.

#### **Forgery Kit**

This represents a catch-all category of tools and materials, from special parchment inks to task-dedicated codifiers intended to help the user forge or duplicate official documents, cognomen, passes and permits. Using this kit in conjunction with the relevant Skill (Trade (Copyist) or Tech-Use) grants a bonus to copy, forge or fabricate such items, depending on the quality of the materials involved and the difficulty of the task. The price shown is for a common quality kit that provides a +10 bonus. A Good Quality kit gives a +20 bonus, while a Best Quality kit provides a +30.

#### **Heretic's Wake Deck**

In the centuries since the sector's founding, the Ministorum has been unstinting in their efforts to stamp-out the game of "Heretic's Wake", but with little success. The game is played with a deck of cards made from a twisted and debased version of the Emperor's Tarot and to possess a set is a crime punishable by "having one's fingers dipped in molten gold"—for the blasphemy of holding such lies and creations of wickedness. The images on each card are rumoured to have been designed by the heretic illuminator, Cassilda, and it is said that if the cards are drawn in a certain pattern, the player will find themselves granted a vision of a far greater game, or perhaps simply go mad. The potential consequences have not prevented Heretics' Wake from spreading throughout the sector to the point where a game can be found in almost every dark recess.

#### **Holo Wafers**

Intended as fealty-badges, bargaining chips or signal-markers, holo wafers are small ceramic discs, each about as thick as a coin and no wider than a palm. Each is keyed to show a particular small holographic image when triggered. The devices have another, more sinister, use as so-called "death markers" or "kill claimers". Holo wafers displaying images such as a winking skull, a weeping mother or a burning tower are de rigueur items in the Scintillian underworld, serving as "calling cards" for many assassins, gunsells and contracted blades who leave them on the corpses of their victims to enhance their mystique and their reputation.

#### **Mantle-Shrine**

Common devotional items in the Calixis Sector, these small portable shrines take the form of a triptych wooden or flakboard box that can be closed into a case for carrying. Traditionally, mantle-shrines feature three hand-painted icons, the central being one of the aspects of the God-Emperor and at his right hand Saint Drusus, and at the left, an image or saint determined by the painter. The base unfolds to hold candles, an incense burner or a tack for votive papers. Most of these mantle-shrines are crafted in the pilgrim shantytowns of Hive Tarsus and exported by the Ecclesiarchy across the sector. One can find mantle-shrines even in the homes of the very poor on many worlds—indeed families often club together to buy them as wedding gifts. Many hive scummers, intent on robbery, also know that a locked mantle shrine is a favoured hiding place for many a poor stack-family's few coins, if they dare desecrate it.

#### **Ocular Catechizer**

A device favoured by ranking adepts, sages and Administratum officials, these arcane and intricate-looking eyepieces are designed to magnify objects and help identify and analyse visual patterns and data. They are somewhat temperamental instruments, requiring stillness and concentration to use; their machine-spirits are notoriously easily vexed, much to the pain of the operator.

Using these devices gains a character a +10 bonus on Literacy, Lore and Search Tests where the close examination of objects, symbols and deciphering written text is involved. Other Actions cannot be attempted while using an ocular, and if a failure by four or more degrees is rolled on a Test involving the device, feedback through the eyepiece inflicts 1 level of Fatigue on the user. The eyepiece can also record its impressions to an attached data-slate for later study.

#### **Penthrift Dreadfuls**

The "penthrift dreadful" is a Calixian slang name for a small, cheaply printed pamphlet containing lurid stories of sordid murders, gang violence, fanciful tales of xenos atrocities and other strange occurrences, all couched in the form of morality tales or scaremongering religious tracts in order to evade censorship by the authorities. A popular, slightly licentious pleasure in the mid-hives, these publications are generally allowed to continue by the powers-that-be as they serve to reinforce the justly held fears and hatreds of the population, although, the Holy Ordos often keep a weather eye on their contents, just to ensure that no dangerous "truths" slip through amid the purple prose.

#### **Salvation Auger**

About the size of a pocket chrono, the salvation auger is designed to detect the presence of harmful radiation, airborne toxins and pollutants. These devices are common on most hive worlds, particularly for up-hivers venturing into the depths. Augers alert the wearer when danger is encountered, coming in a variety of patterns and makes, varying from ornate hololithic dials to utilitarian lapel-boxes that shriek alarms when triggered. Basic models do nothing more than signal danger, while the better models can be read with a Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test to determine the exact nature of the hazard.

#### **Volgite Gloom Eyes**

In the deepest regions of Volg, where light of any form rarely penetrates, the dripping, polluted waste occasionally forms strange amber-like deposits. Globular and glassy, these forms often glow with a strange luminescence that slowly changes and shifts in shade and colour. Rounded lumps, hacked from these deposits, are known as "gloom eyes" and are often carried bound into thongs around the necks of Volg gangers or mirk-stalkers as a form of charm. Though the light they shed is useful, the bearers of these curious objects believe that the eye's glow changes to warn them of danger. Whether true or not, you need any edge you can get if you live in Volg and the belief is widely held.

These items count as a superior charm (see page 146 in Dark Heresy) and they also shed light equivalent to that of a candle when uncovered. Characters from Volg that wear this charm gain a +10 bonus on Tests made to avoiding Pinning.

#### **Vox-Phonograph**

A domestic toy of the wealthy, phonographs are bulky table-piece devices of clockwork-cogs, switches, vox-grills, sounding horns and lens-projectors, built to play music or provide flickering holo-lantern shows. The usual fare for a vox-phonograph is orchestral symphonies, inspirational Ecclesiarchy sermons, issued guild reports and pict-slides, each recorded on a micro-etched metal cylinder which plugs into the machine's loom to be played. Better models (twice the listed price) may record cylinders of their own and play media from other sources such as data-slates. Sadly such entertainment is well beyond the price of the masses in most hives.

#### **Vox-Thief**

This complex device of the Omnissiah's arts is designed to pick up, store and analyse both vox and data transmissions in the surrounding area. They can either be used by an operator or can be covertly hidden to record in a particular area. Using a vox-thief 's basic functions requires a successful Difficult (–10) Tech-Use Test and may be made considerably harder by the nature of the task. Additionally, heavily encrypted signals need further analysis to break their code. Short-range vox-thieves are the size of a data-slate and have a range of about two to three kilometres, while long-range models are larger units, containing a powerful in-built cogitator and are comparable to military vox-casters in size (a large backpack), with a range of up to 50 kilometres. In both cases, this range can be reduced dramatically by local conditions.

#### **Ward Accessor**

Although often ritualised and little understood by most who use them, ward accessors are electronic passes that allow access to certain areas that are otherwise restricted. Such security measures are commonplace in hive cities where individual citizens and workers usually find certain places off-limits. Individual accessors vary widely in appearance, from simple cards to holo-coins, badges of office or even great seals, depending on just where the security is located and what is being guarded. The cost listed here is for a "blank" accessor (a potentially dubious but not illegal item) ready to be programmed with a code.

Drugs

#### **Hab Life**

For most hive citizens who spend their lives trudging from their hab-stacks and mid-hive tenement blocks to dreary and repetitive jobs in the manufactorum, the service-corps and work crews, life represents a somewhat bleak monotony against which they struggle to make something of their sparse conditions, raise families and hope never to suffer the attentions of the nameless horrors that they fear are lurking in the dark universe beyond. On most Imperial hive worlds (and those of Calixis are no different), what little mass media exists is rigidly controlled by the Ecclesiarchy and state for reasons of security and moral instruction. Rampant materialism, outside of the rarefied classes of the highborn and wealthy, is all but unknown. But even the most unimaginative hab-dweller needs some kind of diversion and entertainment to take their minds off their hardships and fears. While the Imperial Creed and the Ecclesiarchy provide great solace for many, the average hive-worlder likes their pleasures simple, direct and visceral—taverns, refectories, music halls and cook-shops offer the most commonplace daily escapes, while visits to holo-lantern shows, the carnivora or circus, or the greenery of a sealed arbour dome, are costly and rare excursions.

There are, of course, some for whom these diversions are not enough; they plunge past the bright lights of the entertainment 'bergs into the shadows that stretch all the way down to the dangerous sinks and stews of underhive. There they find darker forms of quasi-legal and outright forbidden escapes, including the blood sport pits, wager-halls and fighting arenas, pound bars and dust dens, and all manner of other vices offered by a seething criminal underclass—watched over by enforcers often either corrupt themselves, or more interested in maintaining order than the law. Worst still for those who seek such escapes, weakness, ill-fortune or fatal curiosity lead to far more forbidden fruit, whose cost is greater than mere life.

#### **Consumables Gorsk White Gyn** Consumables

Originating from the Fenksworld hive of Magnagorsk and distilled from modified engine coolant (hence its name), this caustic, icecloudy spirit is an extremely powerful brew and favoured by those with a taste for something with a bigger kick than even triplestilled amasec can provide. As well as making you feel as if your head has been staved in, Gorsk White, as a dilute measure, can also mitigate the effects of some tainted water and foods. Such "gyn mixes" are popular in the Metallican Infernis, the rookeries of Solomon and in the Soot Warrens of Tranch for this reason, though the Gorsk White remains the most infamous.

Drinking unmixed Gyn requires a Hard (–20) Carouse Test.

#### **The Wines of Quaddis**

Although amasec may be the most popular fine spirit across the sector, and many local ales and vintages hold sway where they are made, the most sought-after alcohol is the wine of Quaddis. The garden world of Quaddis is considered by most to be nothing more than a myth, or perhaps a place that once did exist but is now long gone to dust. Regardless, the wines produced by its viniculture are valued above all others and almost preternaturally potent. Many hive nobles and guilders pay huge sums for them and, in some cases, plot, murder and steal to attain them; seeing them both a mark of ultimate opulence and good taste. Three such wines are listed here: the first, the Sorrowful Vintage, is widely regarded as a pale imitation of the real thing (but still highly desirable), the second, the Golden Tokay, is perhaps the most accessible "true" Quaddis wine, while the last, the Kataline Malmsey, is the stuff dreams are made off—hugely valuable and, legend holds, capable of killing an over-indulgent drinker with pure pleasure.

#### **Drugs Night Dust** Drugs

The predatory Nightwings of Dusk produce a potent narcotic dust that they use to subdue their victims, lulling them into a nightmarish stupor, while the haemovoric Nightwing quickly sucks them dry. This substance, harvested from captured or slain creatures and rendered down into a concentrated form, is a powerful and prohibited drug. Usually burned as incense or, for a more powerful effect, dissolved in amasec, the dream-racked stupor that night dust induces can last for days, and the term "dusk dream" has long since become local parlance on Malfi for an unexpected disappearance or bout of madness.

A single dose imposes a –20 penalty on all Tests, while the imbiber experiences mild hallucinations and becomes disassociated from their emotions. After 2d10 minutes, the afflicted character slips into a deep feverish slumber filled with vivid and often violent dreams reflecting the darkest facets of their own mind. This state lasts for 1d10 hours and upon wakening the character must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points from the experience. Drinking the dust is far more potent and dangerous: the effects last 41d0 hours and the Willpower Test to avoid Insanity Points is Difficult (–10).

#### **Cults and the Lure of the Forbidden**

Cults find hive worlds their most fertile hunting grounds., and both the soulless drudgery of the mid-hive and brutalising criminality of the underhive make for easy converts, while many a powerful patron can be found among the jaded and dissolute of the hive's ruling elites. In a hive city, a cult can easily hide amidst the faceless masses of humanity, as hives are places where a dozen strangers or even a thousand can go easily unseen until their dark work bears fruit. In recent decades, both the hives of Fenksworld and Sibellus have suffered at the hands of two very different groups, the highly organised and resourced techno-heretics known as the Logicians, and the warp-worshipping nihilistic cult known as the Pilgrims of Hayte. Both have been responsible for thousands of deaths in dozens of plots and insurrections, and despite best efforts, neither one has ever been fully purged from the sector. Fenksworld has long become infamous as a proving ground for conspiracies that are later let loose on a larger stage, while Malfi—long a hotbed of intrigues and deceit—has proved especially vulnerable, with dozens, perhaps hundreds, of competing cults and sects suspected to be operating there at any one time. Indeed, as famously remarked by Lord Inquisitor Marr, "The only thing keeping Malfi from becoming a charnel house is nobody, not even the heretics, dare turn their backs on each other long enough to do the deed." For every conspiracy and heresy rooted out of a hive it is said that two more fester unseen, and the shadows cast by the tallest spires are dark indeed.

#### **Panimune**

This highly potent medicinal compound serves to greatly enhance resistance to most forms of toxins, contaminations, micro-parasites and infection for a period of hours after its application, although repeated use can cause physiological damage. Panimune is found in the med-kits of many enforcer squads, tech-priests and other parties wishing to descend into the underhive or travel through hazard zones.

The dose is usually applied by pressure-hypo directly to the neck and provides a +30 bonus on Toughness Tests made to resist toxins and diseases. As well, this bonus also applies to all Carouse Tests. The effects of a single dose lasts 1d5+1 hours.

After the dose expires, the subject becomes Fatigued until he rests. The subject may immediately re-dose himself (which also negates the Fatigue), but each time this is done without a period of 8 hours rest, he must pass a Toughness Test or take a –10 penalty on Strength and Toughness Tests for 1 hour and permanently reduce Willpower by 1d5.

#### **Slam**

Originating in the infamous Hive Volg on Fenksworld, slam is the worst kind of combat drug imaginable. Harvested from the chemical residue found in the intestinal tracts of the man-sized corpse roaches infesting the meat-sumps, it is first crystallised and then ground into a bile-yellow dust. Slam triggers a biological reaction, causing a massive boost in pain resistance and physical power. The user's muscles and veins visibly spasm and pulse under its influence. Though the effects are short-lived, it is highly sought after despite the long-term damage to the nervous system that even the smallest dose induces.

A character who consumes a dose of slam gains the benefits of the Unnatural Strength (× 2) and Unnatural Toughness (× 2) traits for 1d5 Rounds. Once the drug has run its course, a user permanently reduces their Strength and Agility Characteristics by 1d5.

#### **Somna**

An unusual and powerful drug to say the least, somna is a synthesised extract taken from the pollen of the Nephyis Orchid of Iocanthos. In its refined form, it is capable of producing a powerful coma-like effect in the subject, shutting down the metabolism and life processes, almost to the verge of death, and plunging the mind into a bottomless oblivion beyond the deepest sleep. The subject of somna appears to all but the most probing medical examination to be dead and can survive in this state for days or weeks without food or water and with almost no air. Aside from its medical uses, somna has been put to numerous nefarious purposes in the past from kidnapping, feigning death to evade capture and even as a particularly cruel murder weapon (with the victim waking up to find themselves buried alive.) In recent years, the more vicious narco-gangs of the Sibillan underhive have also used heavily adulterated somna to create "spiral black", a highly potent and extremely dangerous variant of obscura.

Services

Safely using somna, (the exact dosage must be calculated for each subject), requires a successful Difficult (–10) Medicae Test. A failed Test leads to unpredictable results, such that a failure by four degrees or more results in death. A successful Test places the subject into a deathlike trance for a period of time between one to ten days. The subject can be roused before this predetermined time by applying a stimm directly to the heart, but this is risky, and the subject must succeed on a Toughness Test or die from cardiac arrest.

#### **Verita**

The existence of verita is largely a secret and the Ordos Calixis are very happy to keep it that way. A powerful and singular hallucinogenic, once taken, the drinker's perceptions shift slowly to reveal the seeming interplay of distant realms, past, present and future; leading its addicts to claim that they can "see through time" to uncover unknown truths and witness incredible visions. Whether verita's gifts are mere illusions or a sudden immersive vision unfettered by the mortal perceptions of time, is a matter that remains unresolved, but its effects alone are enough to have the Ordos declare it a Moral Threat.

The substance's composition is unknown with many of its trace constituents completely defying analysis. When encountered, it usually takes the form of a viscous deep blue liquid, with a scent suggestive both of flower blossoms and subtle rot. Verita is a drug restricted by its rarity and cost to the very wealthy.

Consuming verita imposes a –10 penalty on Willpower Tests and a –20 penalty on Perception Tests for 3d10 minutes. While affected, the imbiber experiences visions and altered perceptions as determined by the GM. The user is always convinced of the truth of these visions and indeed, the contents of their "waking dream" can be valuable for overcoming some challenge or difficulty. Once the drug has run its course, the imbiber must succeed on a Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Insanity Points. Those victims who gain at least 1 Insanity Point also have a 20% chance of gaining 1d5 Corruption Points as well.

#### **Services Luminum Tats** Services

Common particularly in Infernis and Tranch, but not unknown in Sibellus, lumimum tats (or "shine-jobs" as they are also known), are subdermal circuit and chemical tattoos that are essentially the "poor cousin" of the electoos crafted by the Cult Mechanicus. Displaying luminous and sometimes animate images, markings, slogans and gang-glyphs, they mark membership to one of the many underhive gangs, ward the superstitious from evil and brag about the deeds of the wearer. The more elaborate luminum tats are often the work of hereteks and some of the more radical tech-priests are known to favour their forcible removal from offending flesh, whether the wearer wishes it or not.

#### **The Pale Pits**

As with all else in Volg, entertainment is polluted and brutal. While most hives favour some form of blood sport pit or fighting arena, the "Pale Pits of Volg" are perhaps the most famously debased. The pits feature savage and unwholesome beasts pulled up from the depths below and dumped into a broad, high-sided tank filled up to a half-metre depth with corrosive waste. Driven into a pain-fuelled frenzy by the burning mirk, the creatures rip each other apart whilst the onlookers place wagers. For more "entertaining" games, human fighters (usually either prisoners or outright psychotics who have volunteered), also do battle on a treacherous series of platforms, I-beams and cables set above the pit where the creatures scream and die—any loss of footing leads to a horrific demise either in the corrosive sludge or at the creatures' less than tender mercies.

#### **Finding a Game (Volg)**

Pale Pits are Common on Volg and Scarce on other worlds. Usually, there is no limit to wagers. As well, Pale Pits are also home to a thriving black market and illicit or illegal goods can be found along the pit's periphery—but beware you don't end up on the night's show bill!

#### **The Resusatrix Chamber**

A medicae device intended to speed and aid the healing process. The resusatrix takes the shape of an upright tube-chamber in which the subject is placed and hooked up to sedation, drug-regulation and life-support systems, suspended in a thick curative solution of fluids, antinecrotics and proteins. Thanks to the level of sophisticated technoarcana required in their construction and maintenance, these chambers are often confined to the medicae facilities found on hive worlds and other tech-advanced locales, although some noble houses, ship's captains and guilds are resourced enough to have their own.

The chamber halves the length of time normally taken to heal Wounds naturally. It also prevents infection and adds a +10 bonus to Toughness Tests to overcome the effects of most poisons and diseases. In the case of serious injuries, surgery and other attention may still be needed as appropriate. While in the chamber, the character may do nothing but float in a drugged sleep. The various bio-auguries fitted to the chamber also count as a medical auspex and grant +20 bonus to Medicae Tests to diagnose the patient.

The chamber may only be operated successfully by a character possessing both the Medicae and Tech-Use skills.

# <span id="page-132-0"></span>Forge Worlds Forge Worlds

*"There is no truth in flesh, only betrayal. There is no strength in flesh, only weakness. There is no constancy in flesh, only decay. There is no certainty in flesh but death."*

— Credo Omnissiah.

F orge Worlds are the sovereign domains of the Priesthood of Mars and places where wonders and terrors abound. A

There is no accounting for all the technological marvels and arcane miracles of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and so what follows is a mere sampling of what might be encountered in the forge worlds and domains of the Machine God's priesthood in the Calixis Sector. Each forge world is a leviathan of industry, a realm of metal and fire, smoke and ceaselessly turning gears, where superstition has overturned reason and ritual has murdered progress, a thing of vast scale and tireless motion, where human life is worthless and the quest for power and control are everything. Here are the devices employed by those hailing from forge worlds, techno-arcane devices of such potency and sophistication they have no rival in the wider Imperium, hand weapons, personal gear, servants and cybernetics, each no less strange nor any less potent in their own way than the striding Battle Titans or the city wide foundries one might more readily associate with a forge world.

### Ranged Weapons Rang ed Weapons

The Tech-Adepts are capable of creation weapons of incredible destructive ability. The following ranged weapons are but a sample of their curious arts. T

#### **Exotics Graviton Gun** Exotics

**Class:** Exotic (Graviton Gun)

An extremely rare device, the so-called graviton gun is a little understood relic unlikely to have been originally designed as a weapon at all. When fired at a target area, the energy field generated by the gun creates a sudden and powerful gravitational flux. Whilst unlikely to do more than knock living creatures violently to the floor, the effect can be extremely damaging to the internal mechanisms and moving parts of vehicles, and can be particularly lethal to skimmers and other devices with their own grav-engines quickly destabilised and overloaded by the flux-field.

Everything caught in the gun's blast area is violently pressed to the floor and must take a Very Hard (–30) Strength Test or be knocked down. Being thrown to a solid surface from a standing position and forced to the ground in this way is enough to inflict 1d5 I (Primitive) Damage—treat this as effecting the Body

location—although what the character or object is thrown against and how far they fall may well make this effect far worse.

Additionally, anyone attempting to move or perform physical actions within the blast radius for 2d5 Rounds afterwards must first pass an Opposed Strength Test versus Strength 60 (Unnatural (×2)) each Round—see More Than Human on [page 226](#page-226-0) for more details on this kind of Test).

At the GMs discretion, the flux may shatter brittle objects, collapse loose flooring, rupture containment vessels, damage vehicles and machinery, plus wreak any other chaos deemed appropriate.

#### **Rad-Cleanser**

**Class:** Exotic (Rad-Cleanser)

Rad-cleansers are potent weapons said to be relics of the longpast Dark Age of Technology, and they are certainly powerful and terrible enough in effect to justify that mythic claim. Victims caught in the rad-cleanser's blast suffer an agonising death as their tissues are blown apart on a cellular level and they are boiled alive from within. Even metals may combust in the powerful blast created by a rad-cleanser. These horrific weapons are extremely difficult to manufacture and heavily proscribed by the Cult Mechanicus They are however not as rare amongst the Magos retinues of the Calixis Sector as they are elsewhere, pointing to some Archmagos or facility in the sector that possesses the baleful secret of their construction.

The "toxic" effect listed on this weapon's profile actually represents massive radioactive contamination, and should be treated accordingly. Rad-cleansers must be reloaded by refuelling their bulky reactor-core units, which cannot be done during combat.

#### **Aegis Anbaric Shock Blaster Pistol**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Shock Blaster)

This unusual weapon is a rarity, even among the Magos militant and the Skitarii, and is doubtless a product of the legendary Aegis Fragment. Taking the shape of a bulky, tubular pistol, when fired it discharges a blast of electromagnetic force capable of completely overloading a human's nervous system or just as usefully disrupting the control systems of a rogue servitor. These weapons are configured to use standard laspistol power packs, though because of their high-energy requirements, they get only a relatively few shots from each pack.

#### **Las Weapons D'laku Crusade-Pattern Hellgun** Las Weapons

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Dating back to the Skitarii cohorts that joined in the Angevin Crusade to conquer the Calixis Sector, this pattern of high-power, rapid discharge lasweapon remains unchanged as the standard armament of the elite Skitarii Secutor squads. As well as delivering a larger charge, hellgun blasts are more focused than those of a lasgun and capable of easily punching through light armour, inflicting distinctive "through-and-through" burn wounds on their victims. These matte-black weapons receive energy from a power capacitor usually attached to the backpack of the Secutor's carapace armour, but can use standard lasgun power packs if needed, although they will only get twelve shots from a pack before exhausting it. The D'laku hellgun as an availability of Scarce in the Lathe system and Very Rare on other Forge Worlds.

> **D'laku Crusade-Pattern Hellgun**

#### **The Lathes Of Calixis**

The greatest forge world of the Calixis Sector is not a single world at all. The Lathe System, gifted to the Adeptus Mechanicus in perpetuity during the Agevin Crusade, is a place of strange wonder and arcane science. A trio of semihabitable planets in anarchic, fluxing orbit around their violent blue-white sun, Lathe-Het, Lathe-Hesh and Lathe-Hadd lie at the centre of the system. The population toiling in the massive macro-foundries based there to exploit the unique gravitation fluxes are huge, heavy set brutes more Ogryn in stature than man. They are but one part of the story, for scattered throughout the planetary system are dozens of vast city-sized orbital stations and hundreds of mining and research ouposts, hulks, asteroid bases and scores of vast steelglass-domed agrology platforms—arbours of green and blue that provide food and water amid the frozen void. Access to the inner system is strictly controlled by automated ward ships and the Magos Militant commanding the massed power and might of the Mechanicus, capable of calling in extremis on the dread might of the Titans of Legio Venator who are said to have a hidden fortress on the dead moon of Lycosidae at the system's heart. The outer fringes of the system are somewhat more receptive to visitors, and it is here at the trans-shipping orbitals that the great Chartist vessels and Mechanicus high-liners put in to trade and to export the Lathe System's vast output, whilst also feeding its equally vast hunger for ore and metal. Fiercely independent and beholden to none but the lords of distant Mars, the Lathe System's near five billion inhabitants answer only to the Archmagos council of the ruling Lathe-Covenant, and here the rule of the Omnissiah holds absolute sway.

#### **Plasma Weapons Kronos Mk III Plasma Pistol** Plasma Weapons

#### **Class:** Pistol (Plasma)

In addition to seeing military service, this sophisticated plasma pistol is offered for sale by the Mechanicus weaponsmiths of the Lathes at an exorbitant price for those who wish to purchase its sacred power. Just why this rare and potent device of the Omnissiah's divine wrath is available for sale while other lesser weapons are not remains another inscrutable mystery of the Mechanicus.

The Kronos has two settings: on the maximal setting it consumes three shots from the clip at once, and requires two Rounds after firing to recharge.

**Kronos Mk III Plasma Pistol**

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons Panoptic 0-5 Automata Pistol** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

The construction of these weapons is, by ancient tradition, one of the tests of craft that each would-be techpriest armourer must undertake under the tutelage of the Myrmidon Warsmiths of the Panopticon Orbital in the Lathe System. Aspirants are given a complex and randomly incomplete pattern for the weapon, and through skill and divination must produce a working gun to their master's satisfaction. The successful finished articles are then offered up to the Omnissiah as a sacrifice, and vaporised on the plasma-fire altars of the Machine God. It is quite common for the tech-priests who have studied at the Panopticon to continue to make these pistols in this ritualistic way as a form of mediation and to hone their skills, either using them as personal armaments or giving them as gifts to favoured servants, or more rarely offering them for sale.

These intricate automata-guns feature two separate ammunition cylinders and count as being fitted with a Fire Selector (see Dark Heresy page 142).

#### **Skitarii Vanaheim-Pattern Assault**

### **Shotgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

A robust and tested design, this compact auto-loader shotgun is the standard armament of the Skitarii-Provosts who take the role of the enforcers found on other worlds. Provost enforced law and order is as coldly and absolutely maintained as their machine-minded masters could wish, and any sign of disorder, be it the discovery of a petty crime ring in the worker-habs or a full blown labour-helot uprising, is brutally put down with uncompromising and lethal weapons such as this.

The Vanahiem shotgun features an inbuilt red-dot laser sight and a melee attachment in the shape of a retractable saw-bladed bayonet as standard.

*"Mark then sins that laid our mighty forbears low and learn well their lessons:* 

*Make not a machine that suffers to think as a man, Worship not the false god of progress, And stare not too long into the darkness within,*

*For in the first lies horror, the second ruin and the third eternal regret…"*

— Principia Esoterica.

#### **Breacher**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Breacher)

A breacher is a high-power drilling device made from hyper-dense adamantine alloys and fitted with a matter-wave generator, designed to drill through the toughest materials and ore deposits, break up blocks, and puncture bulkheads. Sometimes carried as a heavy slung rig, but more commonly implanted into the flesh of a servitor or bonded labourer, the breacher can also be used as a devastatingly potent weapon, cable of ripping through armour and flesh like paper.

Because of its bulk and vibration when activated, unless mounted as a purpose-built implant, a Strength Bonus of at least 5 is required to wield a breacher as a combat weapon. Weaker characters suffer a –10 WS penalty for each point of Strength Bonus below 5. If a breacher successfully causes Righteous Fury (see Dark Heresy page 195) the additional Damage caused is 2d10 rather than 1d10.

**"Strike fast and suddenly. Attack without warning. Secure victory before the foe is aware of his danger. Remember always, a war is easily won if your enemy does not know he is fighting."**

#### **Sollex-Aegis Energy Blade**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

A product of information obtained from the Aegis Data Fragment and utilising the properties of the Sollex focusing crystals, this is one of the rarest type of weapons in the Imperium—a blade of coherent high-energy plasma which materialises from the armoured hilt as a blazing, roaring column of blue-white fire. Devastatingly powerful, only a few Sollex-Aegis energy blades are held by individuals outside of the Mechanicus, and their secrets are little understood even by their makers in the mysterious Tech-Priest sect of Sollex. Although potent beyond even most power weapons, they can also prove treacherous to the unwary as the energy blade can fluctuate, the laser containment fail or the insubstantial blade slip unexpectedly.

Whenever a wielder successfully Parries another weapon while using an energy blade and succeeds with two or more degrees of success, the wielder automatically destroys the other weapon. While the energy blade does have a degree of density and mass, physical force applied to the swing contributes nothing to the weapon effect and the wielder's Strength Bonus does not increase its Damage. Should an Attack or Parry attempt with one of these weapons suffer a failure by five or more degrees, resolve the energy blade's Damage against the wielder.

Owing to the harsh actinic light and furnace-blast roar that the blade produces, the wielder cannot attempt to be stealthy while it is switched on. Additionally, the blade consumes canister fuel, just as a plasma pistol does, with each canister worn on the belt and fed via a cable to the hilt (good for 10 rounds of continuous operation).

#### Table 5–2: Forge World Melee Weapons

# IV: Hive & Forge Worlds

# **Omnisian Axe**

**Class:** Melee (Power) A holy icon of the Cult Mechanicus, the Omnisian axe or glaive is granted to adepts who have shown their faith to the Machine God in battle. No common weapon, it is forged with the finest materials and using secrets of tempering and field generation. These fearsome weapons have no equal amongst power weapons. Saw-toothed and marked with sacred equations, to the followers of the Machine God, the bearer of an Omnisian glaive is a most blessed figure, a furious incarnation of the Machine God's power in war.

The bearer of an Omnisian axe receives a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests involving followers of the Machine God. The Omnisian glaive also functions as a multi-tool. An Omnisian axe may never be bought or deliberately obtained—it is gifted only to tech-priests by their superiors.

#### **Vivisector**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Vivisector)

The Vivisector is a long ornate gauntlet that locks over the user's forearm. Servo-augmented articulation extends over the fingers, which are tipped with laser cutters, bio-solvents, shears and flensing instruments. While the ignorant may confuse the Vivisector with a medical device, this is no instrument of healing. Designed to dissect and portion organic tissues in the flesh works of forge worlds, it can be turned into an unwieldy but horrific weapon at a whim.

A Vivisector grants the wielder a +10 bonus on Interrogation and Intimidation Tests, as well as a +10 bonus to Medicae Tests for the purposes of repairing servitors or conducting autopsies. For an additional 500 Thrones, the Vivisector may also be fitted with injector rigs, giving it the additional quality of Toxic.

#### **The Warriors of the Machine God**

In the Calixis Sector, the fiefdoms of the Machine God maintain a strong martial tendency as befits their origins as domains first conquered and won during the Angevin Crusade. As well as the awesome might of the legendary Titan Legions, it is the Skitarii Tech-Guard, also known as the Forge Guard, that form the rank and file of the armed forces of both the Adeptus Mechanicus and the ancient War Houses linked to the Cult Mechanicus. The Skitarii serve to defend their master's domains and carry the priesthood's wrath to their enemies. The Lathe System and their dominion territories are known to maintain large and heavily armed Tech-Guard forces to protect their interests, commanded by the feared Secutors and Magos Militant, tech-priests devoted purely to the science of war and the art of destruction. It is also whispered among the Omnissiah's faithful that more ancient and terrible forces than the Skitarii can also be found in the secret holdfast of the Panopticon Orbital station hidden at the centre of the Lathes' treacherous asteroid belts. Here it is claimed the Myrmidons walk; masters of the mysterious Ordo Reductor, they are said to be towering and fearful figures decked out in blood-red and black robes, bearing the forbidden weapons of a bygone age. Even wilder legends speak of this place as the home of mech-assassin covenants and the dread Magister Samadhi – beings who most Magos consider no more than a dark myth. Some even speculate that the Panopticon's rulers are members of a secret order known as the Lords Dragon, an ancient and powerful cabal of Archmagos tasked with policing the Mechanicus itself. Whatever the truth of these tales, the Panopticon is regarded as a bellicose and dangerous place, and a destination of perilous pilgrimage for those of the Omnissiah's faithful who wish to perfect the lores of weaponcraft. Not all who journey there return, and those that do are often darkly changed by the secrets they have learned.

# Armour Armour

<span id="page-137-0"></span>*"From the weakness of the mind, Omnissiah save us, From the lies of the Antipath, circuit preserve us, From the rage of the Beast, iron protect us, From the temptations of the Fleshlord, silica cleanse us, From the ravages of the Destroyer, anima shield us, From this rotting cage of biomatter, Machine God set us free."*

— Chants of the Journeyman, Verse III/w-k-03.

The same innovation and expertise that tech-priests bring to weaponry can be found in their various forms of armour. T

#### **Amulet of Warding**

Often fashioned into the familiar cog and skull symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus, these rare, fist-sized amulets contain powerful refractor field generators capable of warding off the fiercest blows and most violent assaults. Rarer yet, the Mechanicus might offer such an item as a gift or to seal some great bargain, fashioning the generator into some other pleasing or appropriate form.

This amulet functions as a force field. Any time the wearer is attacked, he may roll 3d10 and reduce the Damage dealt by the sum of the dice. Should the wearer roll double ones, the attack bypasses the field completely (do not reduce the Damage). If the wearer rolls double tens, the field overloads and shuts down for 1d10 Rounds. In the case of an overload, the wearer must roll an extra 1d10. On a result of an 8, the amulet is burned out and cannot be used again.

While activated, the air around the user visibly ripples and crackles intermittently with static discharge. This effect imposes a –20 penalty on all Concealment and Stealth Tests. A field may not be activated for more than one hour without burnout occurring: the amulet requires two hours to recharge once it has been used. Activating a field is a Half Action.

#### Table 5–3: Forge World Armour **Armour Location(s) AP Wt Cost Availability Covered Advanced Armour** Dragon Scale Head, Arms, 8 20kg 7,500 Tech-Priest Body, Legs Only **Force Field** Amulet of Warding Head, Arms, † 1kg 30,000 Very Rare Body, Legs

#### **Dragon Scale**

Worn by the warrior tech-priests of the Magos Militant and the field enginseers assigned to frontline duty with the Imperial Guard, each set of dragon scale is individually hand-forged from adamantine and ceramite plating and woven with prayers of permanence and micro-etched with fractal incantations of defence. Offering protection equivalent to the finest powered armour, dragon scale's greatest advantage is that it is designed to interface directly with the tech-priest's cybernetic body and draws its power from his potentia coil, never needing to be recharged while worn.

This armour includes a photo-visor and a respirator. In addition, it increases the wearer's Strength Characteristic by +10. This armour requires the user to be fitted with a cybermantle and potentia coil.

#### <span id="page-138-0"></span>Implants & the Blessings of the Omnissiah Imp lan ts & The Blessings of the Om n issia h

*"No flesh shall be spared."*

— The MkXIII Cantos.

The following systems and implants expand on those described in the Cybernetics section of Dark Heresy and follow the same rules for cost, quality, surgery and recovery as presented in the core rulebook. These enhancements represent a sampling of the kind of modifications that flesh endures on forge worlds in service to the Omnissiah, and the sorts of blessings a Magos might perform on others for the right fee or boon. T **Injector Rig**

#### **Chem Implants**

These internal systems are often copies of ancient biotech designs made to automatically dispense stimms and other drugs directly into the user's bloodstream. The most advanced of these systems are rare and arcane surgical implants whose use is often limited to elite Skitarii warriors and the dreaded mech-assassins. For the right price, however, the Mechanicus will perform this surgery on anybody, and many great house or guild agents and even nobles undergo it. Far cruder, but no less effective, are more primitive injector-rigs, the product of heretek workshops and renegades made for eager gang-heavies, blood-hungry mercs and cyborg pit fighters—they can turn the most unwilling subject into a savage killer.

#### **Chem Gland**

These rare and expensive implants are wonders of the biosculptor's craft. Invisibly concealed within the body are miniaturised chemical factories that consume the user's own natural resources to synthesise powerful chemical agents.

Pick up to three substances when the implant is performed (such as Stimm, Panimune, and so on). The character can "gland" any one of these at will as a Half Action by succeeding on a Routine (+10) Toughness Test. A failed Test however inflicts a level of Fatigue. A failure by four or more degrees deals 1d10 points of Toughness Damage.

#### **Injector Rig**

These relatively crude cybernetic systems are obviously artificial and might include arrays of intramuscular hypodermics or flesh-wielded drug tubes linked to bulky chem-canisters sutured to the user's back. These rigs may contain ten doses of up to four separate substances at once (most commonly Frenzon, Slaught, Stimm and De-Tox).,Injecting one of these is a Half Action and the effects are instant. Depending on the nature of the rig, it may be triggered either by manual control or by remote control by some other individual (particularly if the user is a slave fighter). As well as the normal dangers of excessive drug use and the drugs themselves, if the user suffers a Critical Hit, there is a chance that the injector malfunctions and poisons him. The character must succeed on a Toughness Test or the injector deals 2d10 points of Damage, ignoring Armour Points.

#### **Concealed Weapon Bionic**

Using a pre-existing bionic arm, a pistol or a short, singlehanded melee weapon can be modified and implanted as a concealed device. Weapons concealed in this fashion can be deployed and readied as a Half Action.

**Poor:** The bionic weapon functions as normal, but gains the Unreliable Quality. In addition, the weapon cannot be removed with a Disarm, and locating the weapon requires a detailed inspection or a successful auspex scan.

**Common:** As Poor, but the weapon loses the Unreliable Quality.

**Good:** As Common, but the weapon functions as being best craftsmanship.

**Disadvantage:** Any catastrophic Jam or Overheat automatically disables the limb in question as well as the weapon.

#### **Hermetic Infusion**

As another departure from the frailties of the flesh, the infuser system replaces human blood and blood processing organs with a far more efficient biomechanical serum, the most advanced forms of which contain legions of microscopic homunculitic machines that can search out and repair damage on a cellular level with frightening speed.

**Prerequisite:** Tech-Priest, Autosanguine talent.

**Common:** The tech-priest gains a +10 bonus on Tests made to resist toxins, diseases and radioactive contamination. As well, the tech-priest gains the Die Hard talent.

**Good:** As Common, but the bonus on Tests increases to +20 and the tech-priest gains the Regeneration trait.

**Disadvantages:** Aside from a greying of the flesh and visible withering of the tissues, Hermetic Infusion has one marked side effect: the tech-priest's body can no longer use human blood, and so cannot be treated for Blood Loss or severe injuries by transfusion or regular medical treatments. Instead, the tech-priest must look to his own care (if possible) or that of a Magos Biologis to replace his lost serum.

#### **Mining Helot Augmetics**

A forge world is a hungry monster, devouring raw materials without pause or satiation. This hunger is fed by the blood and sweat of countless indentured labours (known as helots) and servitors who toil to feed the macro forges and titanic foundries. The Machine God is not without gifts for those that labour to feed it. In the deep mines, the helots are fitted with massive implant-drills and rams bonded into their nervous system, and their bodies are augmented to better perform their duties. Such improvements are often crudely fitted, and endlessly recycled for use again after the failure of their current fleshy housing.

**Common:** Mining Helot Augmetics give the character an extra limb fitted with a breacher (see [page 135\).](#page-135-0) This implant increases the character's Strength and Toughness Characteristics each by +10, thanks to surgically implanted muscle tissue and bionic skeletal reinforcement.

**Drawbacks:** Unfortunately, the side effects of these somewhat crude and bulky flesh-metal fusions reduce the character's Agility Characteristic by –10. These implants are performed with little thought given to the level of pain or discomfort they inflict, thus recipients gain 1d10 Insanity Points.

#### **The Calixian Domains of the Mechanicus**

While the Lathes are the most widely known and undoubtedly powerful Mechanicus domains in the Calixis Sector, there are numerous other minor holdings, ranging from unmanned explorator way stations, to mining outposts, colonial satrapies and research facilities. Here are a few of the more unusual domains.

#### **Heterodyne Station**

Once little more than a forgotten feudal world of Uziel on the edge of the Hazeroth Abyss, a century ago this colony was ceded as a result of political manoeuvrings into Mechanicus control. The Magos have maintained a surprisingly light hand, subtly influencing the planet's development and infiltrating its ruling elite with advisors. As a result of their efforts, the world has thrived. Now feudal primitivism and the techno-arcane exist side-by-side. It is a world where cyber-augmented beasts pull the ploughs in fields still sown by hand, and liveried gun-servitors patrol the battlements of stone castles. The aristocracy has begun to embrace the Omnissiah and its servants as the ultimate guarantee of their power. Whether this unusual approach by the world's distant overlords is some generations-long experiment or some rarely used but established practice of the Mechanicus remains unknown.

#### **Sheol 17**

In the icy outer sphere of a star that has no name other than a blank codifier sequence, lies the Mechanicus facility known in encrypted transmissions as Sheol 17. Built around a jagged ferrous asteroid mass, the facility is a vast, open framework of struts and pipes that carry life support feeds to the sealed units that hang there like spiders' nests clustering in the shadowed branches of a dead tree. Each isolated unit is up to half a kilometre in length and holds up to a thousand breathing souls. Sheol-17 is a prison; here techno-heretics that have sinned against the holiness of the Machine God are condemned to be kept until the Mechanicus is certain that their heresy does not reveal some truth or lead to accomplices yet unpunished. When certainty is reached, prisoners are taken to the heart of the machinery and their flesh put to use as a servitor, their bodies blessed to serve the Omnissiah until it proves its weakness and fails, the graven rune of Sheol burned into their skin as a warning to others.

#### **The Hippocrasian Agglomeration**

The Hippocrasian Agglomeration orbits the lifeless world of Morwen VI, a planet whose life was stripped from it by orbital bombardment at the outset of the Adrantian phase of Angevin's great crusade. The Hippocrasians are a sect of the Biologis concerned with the death of flesh: how it occurs, what brings it about and how it can be halted. What purpose the Adrantine fringes are to them is not known, but the planet's scorched and ash-coated surface suits the needs of the Hippocrasian sect. The area has drawn more and more Magos who hold common fascinations with the nature of life and death, and who wish to pursue their work undisturbed. Today, Morwen VI is orbited by an irregular agglomeration of ships that now make up one of the largest and most secretive Mechanicus independent facilities in the sector, and a frequent layover for explorator ships wishing to travel the Nebula.

#### **The Rite of Setesh**

Utilised by the rich and powerful whose fear of death is sufficient to overcome their love of humanity, these augmetic rigs (known in Mechanicus lore as the Rite of Setesh) involve the living mummification of a dying body and its emplacement in an all-encompassing exoskeleton designed to keep an advanced aged or disease-ravaged body alive long past natural limits, trapping the body in what amounts to little more than a semi-mobile iron coffin devoid of human contact. The use of these augmetics is largely frowned upon even by the Mechanicus as skirting the edge of technoheresy in form and function. In the Calixis Sector, only the isolated and independent Magos Biologis of the Hippocrasian Agglomeration are willing to fashion these implant systems, and only then for a price that would beggar a king.

**Common:** This rite grants a character the Machine (4) trait (except this Trait does not affect his or her mind) and the Regeneration trait. Wounds and mental characteristics are unchanged.

**Drawbacks:** The character reduces Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Agility to half (round down). Life in one of these devices is nightmarish and painful. The character gains 2d10 Insanity Points. Also, the rotted biology contained within adds +5 to any Critical Effect inflicted against the character.

#### **Vehicle Interface Circuitry**

Interface circuitry is one of the greatest treasures preserved from the golden past by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Glimmering neuron-interface circuitry implanted into the tissues of the hands allows an intuitive interface between a pilot and his craft. The most famous examples of implanted interface circuitry are from Galvia in the Scarus Sector, but certain forge worlds have the designs and capacity to create such wonders, one being the vast Myromentz orbital station in the Lathe System.

**Common:** Interface implants grant a +10 bonus on Pilot Tests when operating any vehicle with interface receptors. In addition, a character equipped with this circuitry may also make a Perception Test (Difficulty set by the GM) to determine a vehicle's status and condition as a Free Action.

# <span id="page-141-0"></span>Servitors Servitors

*"Once We Were Gods."*

— Opening statement of the *Proscribed Techno-Heretic Text "In defence of the future; a logical discourse",* M.38.

Servitors are automatons or robots whose basic control components are organic and most often human in origin. The process of creating a servitor purges the higher brain functions and psychic pattern of the subject thus destroying the personality and will, rendering it a blank slate to be programmed. Servitors can vary very widely in form and function, from crude but powerful industrial models, to the faceless mass of basic labour drones, to gilded and unique creations built to serve the needs of the wealthy and powerful. S

#### **The Janus Simulacra**

These human-form servers are advanced indeed, often containing only the barest minimum of living tissue. They skirt the edge of the direst techno-heresy with their cogitator-assisted cortex functions and seeming parody of human responses. Playthings of the most fantastically wealthy, simulacra are often fashioned in the shape of gilded works of art—human-sized dolls come to life or seemingly animate statuary. But beneath their resplendent finery lives a clockwork heart and hydraulic-fed piston limbs slaved to a harvested living cortex and splicedin nerve ganglia. Despite the wonder and sophistication of these creations, only the most depraved or foolhardy would attempt the sin of passing one as human or aping sentience too closely, for to do so would provoke the unbridled wrath of the Cult Mechanicus, and entire worlds have burned for this transgression in the past.

# Familiars Familiars

<span id="page-142-0"></span>F amiliars are artificial creatures and constructs that slavishly follow and attend to their master. These are restricted to creatures smaller than an adult human (anything else would class as a servitor), and by their nature cleave to a single master unless instructed otherwise. Mostly, familiars do not possess any significant degree of intelligence and are trained or programmed to perform certain tasks on command. Familiars are either living creatures controlled by the mind of their master via arcane psyber neuro-implants or are cybernetic creatures controlled by voice or coded vox-signal command. Such slaved creatures are the strange fruit of ancient sciences and arcane superstitions, and the ownership and command of familiars utilise many technologies that the Machine Cult considers sacred. A trailing throng of bonded familiars is a sign of status both within the Mechanicus and the Imperium at large. F

#### **Controlling Familiars**  Controlling Familiars

In many respects, familiars function as other creatures. They have Characteristics, Skills, Talents, Traits and more. However, because of their servitude to their controller, they require special rules.

Familiars are controlled by their masters through the use of simple commands. These are generally single words, short sentences or the equivalent, and so giving a command is generally a Free Action. At the GMs discretion, the familiar may have to succeed on an Intelligence Test to interpret a contradictory or complex order.

Should a master come under attack, the familiar automatically moves to its master's defence, attacking the assailant unless it receives specific instruction (or possesses an instinct) to the contrary.

Upon completing a task, the familiar returns to its master's side unless it's received prior instructions or some other instinct applies.

#### **Creating a Familiar** Creating A Familiar

Familiars can be based on a wide number of living creatures, bio-constructs or pure automata. The easiest way to handle this is to create one by taking a creature from the Animal and Vermin list (Chapter XII: Aliens, Heretics and Antagonists of Dark Heresy) and applying one or both of the following modifications that follow. Servo-skulls and cherubim are very particular kinds of familiar common to the Adepta of the Imperium, and are dealt with separately.

#### **Cyber-Creatures**

Cyber-familiars are semi-intelligent machine versions or cybernetic adaptations of living creatures controlled by a master, loyalty to whom is hardwired in the creature's brain. Some cyber familiars are created as assistants to serve prominent adepts and the Mechanicus, or merely as amusements for the wealthy, while others are fitted for war with implanted weapon systems and all manner of crude but effective augmetics.

**Modifications:** Any bestial creature of Scrawny Size or less may be upgraded into a cyber-familiar and is subject to the following changes:

- The creature gains the Machine (2) trait and +2 Wounds.
- The creature's natural attacks no longer count as Primitive.
- Increase the creature's Strength and Toughness Characteristics each by +5 and decrease Agility by –5.
- Very heavily augmented cyber-creatures intended for combat (or with little or no living tissue left), increase their Machine trait to (3 to 5) and gain the Fearless talent. In addition, if their creator wishes, they also lose the Bestial trait.

The cyber-creature may also have numerous items of equipment or weaponry implanted within their bodies just as a human can, such as a respirator, auspex or gun (see Cybernetics on page 153 in Dark Heresy). Specific programming or systems that duplicate the effects of pertinent Talents, Skills or Traits to use such devices can be included by means of cortical implantation.

If a cyber-familiar ever suffers from a failure of four or more degrees on a Willpower Test or suffers a Critical Hit to the head, there is a 50% chance for its programming to break down catastrophically and a debased form of its organic mind will take over. It then goes mad, savagely and randomly attacking everybody and everything in its path until it is destroyed.

# IV: Hive & Forge Worlds

#### **Berserker-Chip**

Also known as "lobos" and "butcher-jobs", these devices are surgically imbedded in the creature's brain. When triggered, the chip sends it into a near uncontrollable bloodlust and frenzy, backed by heavy doses of combat drugs pumping into its remaining organic tissues. These chips are activated either by a command word or signal sent directly to the beast.

Creatures under the influence of a berserker-chip gain the Frenzy talent (triggered instantaneously by codeword or signal from its master). While the implant is active they also gain temporary immunity to Characteristic Damage and Stunning (although they will suffer the effects as normal once the chip is shut off ). The chip is deactivated again by a command word or signal, after which the creature takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue. Unfortunately there is a 10% chance each time the chip is used that it fails to deactivate, leaving the creature in an uncontrollable, frenzied state (although after a few hours the creature dies in any case from overexertion and shock).

#### **Example Cyber-Familiar: Adeptus Arbites Cyber-Mastiff**

Cyber-mastiffs are usually deployed under the control of Adeptus Arbites or enforcer units to bring down recidivists and heretics. Shaped in the form of a hound made of metal and guided by the brain and nervous system of a hunting creature, they are a fearsome extension of the Emperor's law, and a truly terrible sight to see unleashed.

**Traits:** Armour Plated, Brutal Charge, Enhanced Senses (Smell), Machine (4), Quadruped, Size (Scrawny). **Weapons:** Bite (1d10+3 R).

**Armour (Machine):** Head 6, Forelegs 6, Body 6, Hindlegs 6. **Gear:** (Implanted) IR vision implant, filter plugs.

#### **Psy-Bonded Familiar**

A psy-bonded (or psyber) familiar is a living creature bonded to its master by arcane technology. Interface circuitry in both familiar and master (called a psyber-lure) allows the creature to be directly and precisely controlled, with the master having access to the sensory experiences of the creature and able to give it instantaneous commands at great distance.

Owing to the idiosyncrasies of the little understood technology, usually only small non-sapient creatures can become psy-bonded. The creature must begin with both the Bestial trait and a size of Scrawny or less.

The range at which a character can influence a psy-bonded creature is equal to their Willpower Bonus in kilometres, although local conditions might limit this drastically.

A creature may be given both the Cyber and Psy-Boned upgrades. The cost of this implant is included in the cost of the familiar but note that the character will need to follow the rules for attaching implants (see page 153 of Dark Heresy).

Modifications: Increase the psy-bonded creature's Intelligence and Willpower Characteristics each by +5. Also, the familiar gains +1 Wound.

Special: A character with a Psy Rating of 2 or more treats their Psyber-familiar as a Psy-Focus and can extend the effects of their relevant psychic abilities to affect their psyber-familiars by increasing the target number of the power in question by +2.

#### **Example Psyber-Familiar: Psyber-Eagle**

Psyber-eagles are created as gifts from the Adeptus Mechanicus to the grandees of the Imperium. Within the Calixis Sector, most famously, Lord Hax himself is accompanied by a pair of psy-bonded eagles of prodigious size and splendour, gifts from the Mechanicus Fabricator-Lords of the Lathe System. The eagle's circle above him in the vast vaulted halls of the Lucid Palace, their eyes those of their master scanning from on high.

#### <span id="page-144-0"></span>**Servo-Skulls**  Servo–Skulls

Servo-skulls are human skulls (often that of a favoured servant or low ranking tech-priest) that have been fitted with rudimentary machine-spirits, support systems as well as an anti-grav motor to provide lift. These constructs are devoted to a particular task and have the basic equipment to carry out the purpose that they have been programmed to perform. Their advantages are their small size and manoeuvrability, which allows them to enter otherwise inaccessible spaces or hazardous areas that would endanger their operators, as well as the ability to act as additional "eyes and ears" for their masters. The servo-skull is synonymous with the Adeptus Mechanicus, who regard these creations as excellent servants and their machine-spirits as exceptionally faithful and pure. Servo-skulls can also be found serving faithfully with the other Adepta and the high-ranking elites of many hive worlds.

#### **Servo-Skulls as Familiars**

In most respects, a servo-skull behaves exactly like a voicecontrolled cyber-familiar. The greatest difference is that a servoskull has different instincts (programmed responses) and may be given additional commands. All servo-skulls hover above the ground and may remain stationary for any length of time.

#### **Guardian-Skull**

Designed with a somewhat reinforced structure and fitted with a single efficient weapon system and targeting selection programs, guardian-skulls (also known as gun-skulls and combat-skulls depending on their armament) are uncommon but prestigious and effective bodyguard devices. Their small size, tireless vigilance, and ability to hover in the shadows silently make them surprisingly discreet and effective servants.

| Guardian-Skull Profile |          |    |    |    |     |     |    |     |

#### **Movement:** — **Wounds:** 5

**Skills:** Awareness (Per +20), Concealment (Ag +10), Dodge (Ag +10), Silent Move (Ag +20).

**Talents:** Fearless, Weapon Training talents appropriate to its armaments.

**Traits:** Dark Sight, Flier 6, Machine (3), Programmed Instinct, Size (Puny).

**Weapons:** Unarmed (1d10–3 I; Primitive), see following. Armour (Machine): Head 3.

**Combat- or Dissector-Skull:** Articulated limbs tipped with mono-edged blades dangle from the combat-skull. At their master's word, the combat algorithms embedded in the skull's circuits can be activated and it becomes a murderous device of whirling and slicing razor edges and mono-blades. The skull's usual natural attack is replaced with one that inflicts 1d5+2 Damage, Pen 2. The skull may not Parry with its mono-blades. Occasionally, combat-skulls are fashioned with other more potent weapons such as electro-flails and chain knives, but these are rarer and more costly.

**Gun-Skull:** A gun-skull is fitted with a single ranged weapon, such as an autocarbine or las carbine, although conceivably any Pistol or compact Basic weapon could be fitted—this might obviously increase the purchase cost and availability. The skull's gun is also fitted with a red-dot laser sight.

#### **SPECIAL RULES**

**Commands:** A guardian-skull can be commanded as per a cyber-familiar. In addition, the skull may be given the following orders:

**Guard:** Follow and protect its master or an assigned individual.

**Search and Destroy:** Methodically search a given area and terminate everything not on a predetermined list of exceptions.

**Sentry:** Guard a specific location, object or patrol a given area. **Programmed Instinct:** Unless the guardian-skull has been expressly ordered otherwise, it attacks and destroys anything that directly attacks or threatens its charge (with a "tolerance level" set by its master). In addition, it defends itself with deadly force if attacked. If its master is seriously injured, it interposes itself preventing further harm at the cost of its own destruction if needs be.

#### **Life In the Shadow of the Omnissiah**

Life on a forge world is harsh even by Imperial standards. The Adeptus Mechanicus grade, quantify and measure every child born in their domain to best find their use and how they might serve within the Omnissiah's great pattern. The most promising are inducted into the ministries of the Machine God, destined, in time, to find their place among the ranks of the priesthood. Of the rest, a percentage of the most physically able are subjected to the trials of the Skitarii and other more secretive castes. For the majority, however, there is a place, willing or not, within the forge world's vast webs of production. Such life-long service forms the mass of skilled workers that maintain the forge world's industries. These menials (or labour units as they are known) are free to make what lives they can for themselves in conditions largely no different from those found on most hive worlds, that is so long as work quotas are met, order maintained and their masters' arcane pursuits are not disturbed. For those that fail in their service, fall badly injured or are proven guilty of some crime, punishment is harsh as new labour-helots and organic servitor components are always in demand.

#### **Monotask-Skull**

The most common form of servo-skull encountered, monotask-skulls are designed and equipped to offer assistance with a particular task, and most are fitted with a basic set of extendable manipulator pincers and whatever else by way of gear their duty requires.

| Monotask-Skull Profile |          |    |    |    |     |     |    |     |

#### **Movement:** — **Wounds:** 4

**Skills:** Awareness (Per +20), Concealment (Ag +10), Dodge (Ag), Silent Move (Ag +10).

**Talents:** Fearless.

**Traits:** Commands, Dark Sight, Flier 6, Machine (1), Programmed Instinct, Size (Puny).

**Weapons:** Unarmed (1d10–3 I; Primitive).

**Armour** (Machine): Head 1.

**Gear:** The skull is fitted with a pict-relay allowing it to record or transmit what it sees and senses to its master or a linked cogitator, as well as onboard systems allowing it to navigate its surroundings, identify creatures and objects, and faultlessly retrace their paths. A monotask-skull is also specially fitted to conduct a particular simple task; some of the most common are listed here:

**Auger:** The skull is fitted with an auspex and vox-data system to relay its findings.

**Courier:** This skull is used as a messenger and comes fitted with a specialised identity scanner as well as extensive programmed maps of the local area and the like. The skull may simply carry a physical message such as a scroll or dataslate, or replay a recording from an internal holo-system.

**Illuminator:** The skull is fitted with a powerful lamppack or glow-globe, or indeed a burning brazier of coals (a particular favourite with the Ecclesiarchy).

**Loud Hailer:** The skull is fitted with a powerful public address system, and may replay recorded messages or sounds, or its master may speak through it.

**Medicae-Skull:** The skull has a built in medi-kit and medical scanner. It adds Medicae (Int +20) to its Skills, which it will use to administer first aid at its master's direction.

Utility: The skull is fitted with a multi-tool, and while it can perform simple programmed maintenance tasks, its real use is via its master operating the skull remotely as an extra pair of hands and to reach areas he could not otherwise access.

#### **SPECIAL RULES**

**Commands:** A monotask-skull can be commanded as per a cyber-familiar. In addition it is programmed to perform simple repetitive tasks based around its function (such as illuminate a certain room, conduct a message to a designated location, and so on).

**Programmed Instinct:** The skull will not attack or even defend itself unless expressly ordered to do so by its master, and even then it removes itself from harm's way if damaged. Likewise if stymied, interfered with or damaged, a skull returns to its master's side or base of operations.

#### **Cogitator Systems**

Machines created to sift and consider data, to calculate and to process the sacred language of algorithm, these devices range from small portable models to larger logos tabernacles and matriculation-engines integrated into manufactora, star ships and archive centres.

Using a suitable cogitator grants a bonus on Literacy, Logic and Lore Tests when having to compare or sift through large volumes of data.

#### **Emplaced**

These cogitator systems analyse and process vast quantities of data (planetary tithe records, genotype reconstructions, and so on). Most also feature auto-quills to print data-scrolls, machine-spirit shrines and symbiotic operations-savants or holo-projectors incorporated into their structure. They grant a +20 bonus on relevant Tests. Proper rites and rituals must be observed during cogitator operations on this scale or they will become subject to severe inaccuracies and glitches, perhaps even possession by malign spirits.

#### **Personal**

These portable units are capable of analysing the information from data-slates and similar sources, and provide a +10 bonus on relevant Tests.

#### **Grey Devices**

Strange brushed-metal boxes that seem to eat power and make chiming noises in response to unknown factors, socalled grey devices are small pieces of technology that have no clear purpose, carry a peculiar aura to them and seem to answer questions in some way. These odd devices first turned up in the ancient Pellucidan Tunnels, and are considered sacred mysteries to the Priesthood of Mars

but also have become a blasphemous item of superstition and forbidden games of prognostication for others. These heretics bait the machine-spirits of the grey devices hoping to make them respond, making a gambling game of it, while others treat them as auguries or links to the beyond. Some say the devices respond purely randomly or in ways barely understood let alone mimicked by a player, others that some contain "malifica", vile unclean spirits that lead the unwary astray.

**Finding a Game:** Trying to find a place offering games with a grey device requires an Availability Test on a forge world or Mechanicus domain with a –30 penalty. It is allbut impossible if the person trying to find it is a techpriest or in the company of tech-priests. If a device can be found, however, aside from its worth, it will often provide an introduction into darker things.

#### **Holo-Projector**

Cased in brass, crawling with chrome-sheathed cables and hissing steam, a holo-projector is a feature common to the briefing rooms of the various arms of the Adepta. The rituals of constructing and maintaining these devices are some of the most ancient and sacred. The flickering cone of blue-tinged imagery it projects is the product of muttered prayers and burning tapers. A holo-projector can be linked to a cogitator or other data feed.

#### **Hyper-Density Penetrators (Ammo)**

Famously nicknamed "Lathe Body-Blowers" for their appalling effect of ploughing through vulnerable flesh, these bullets are cast from a unique dense metal alloy only made possible by exploiting the strange gravitational forces within the Lathe System. Because of their great mass, they must be propelled by a far more powerful explosive charge than a normal round, and so are limited only to the sturdiest firearms capable of handling them.

**Effects:** Reduce the base range of the weapon by half. Increase its Penetration by 2. The weapon gains the Tearing Quality. Finally, an average man-sized target hit by one of these rounds must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test or be knocked off its feet from the impact.

**Weapons:** Hand cannon, hunting rifles, shotguns (lose the Scatter effect), bolt pistols and boltguns (weapon Damage type changes from X to I).

#### **Isotropic Fuel Rods**

A basic building block of Imperium technology, and truly a surviving wonder of the High Dark Age, these metre-long metal rods contain a concentrated liquid metal storage medium capable of holding vast quantities of energy. A single fully-charged rod is able to power a small settlement or entire hab-block for several weeks. The technology to create isotropic fuel rods is a jealously guarded Mechanicus secret, and the rods themselves are highly valuable commodities.

#### **Lathe Blade (Weapon Upgrade)**

The astronomical and gravitic alignment of the Lathe worlds creates the conditions for the production of metal alloys of rare and singular properties. Such a strange metal is used to fashion the legendary Lathe blade. So phenomenal is their strength and structure that they can have paper thin edges yet be flexible enough for the blade to resist breaking under the impact of the most powerful blows, and can even be unaffected by the devastating action of a power field. Some, including Lord Hax himself, favour a Lathe-forged blade over a power weapon such is their quality and repute.

**Effects:** A Lathe-bladed weapon loses the Primitive quality. Increase the weapon's Damage by 2 and its Penetration by +3. Wielders of these weapons gain a +10 bonus on Weapon Skill Tests. A Lathe blade cannot be destroyed by the effects of a power field and counts as having an Armour value of 25 if directly attacked. A Lathe blade is automatically of the Best Craftsmanship (the effects of this have already been included in these rules). This upgrade cannot be combined with the Mono upgrade.

**Weapons:** Knives, throwing knives, swords, axes and great weapons.

#### **Opus Machina**

One of the ancient names given to the skull and cog wheel symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Opus Machina is known throughout the Imperium and is as sacred to the servants of the Omnissiah as is the Aquila is to the Ecclesiarchy. The versions presented here are no simple symbols, but contain broadcasted code-ciphers and data-djinn to proclaim their master's worth to those that are pure enough to hear.

As long as the character knows how to employ it properly that is, has the Common Lore (Machine Cult) skill—the bearer of this symbol gains a +10 bonus on all Fellowship Tests concerning tech-priests and followers of the Machine God.

#### **Greater Icon of Passage**

This devices functions as a standard Opus Machina, but it also carries numerous code ciphers, over-ride decrypts, and effector fields, making it the equivalent of a set of multikeys (see page 151 of Dark Heresy), granting a +10 bonus on Security Tests made to disable alarms and commune with machine-spirits.

#### **Tempest Bolt Shells (Ammo)**

Tempest bolts shells are manufactured in one place only, Mars, the only world capable of exploiting the rare and potent technology needed to produce such arms. Tempest shells contain a powerful miniaturised plasma-shock generator that releases a pulse of electromagnetic and thermal energy as the shell detonates. Quantities of Tempest shells are held in the armouries of the Magos Militant of the Lathes and used to equip the tech-priest Destructor Covenants sent out to destroy hereteks and other rogue elements, as they are particularly effective at destroying corrupted or abominable machines.

**Effects:** Change the weapon's Damage class from X to E. The weapon also gains the Shock quality.

**Weapons:** Bolt pistols, boltguns and heavy bolters.

#### **The Tears of the Dragon**

The Adeptus Mechanicus makes extensive use of artificial psycho-viral infection to condition the minds of their servants via the use of so-called meme-viruses. The Tears of the Dragon is the name of one such rare and hazardous agent, used most often on the elite Skitarii Centurions. Once infected, the subject falls into a deathly fever, and is confronted with pre-programmed visions and sense-recordings of the worst horrors the Mechanicus have encountered in its long history. Those that survive this meme-virus fever with their minds intact have conquered fear and the frailties of human sanity.

After infection, the subject must succeed on a Difficult (–10) Willpower Test or gain 1d10+10 Insanity Points. A successful Test grants the character the Fearless talent but permanently reduces his Fellowship by 1d10 points.

*"The soles of my boots are caked with the dust of a hundred worlds, so mark what I say well for I know whereof I speak: the Emperor's Galaxy is filled in with hot, cold, steamy, dank, polluted, airless, swampy, gassy, icy and otherwise miserable planets. I'll allow that there are a few pleasant worlds, but docking fees alone will likely pauper ye on those. I say expect nothing pleasant in yer travels and you'll seldom be surprised."*  — Rogue Trader Kobal Aizdar.

The Calixis Sector sits on the very rim of the Imperium, beyond which lies only the cold dark. A considerable number of the planets within the sector are classified as feral or frontier, and even many of the so-called "civilized" worlds consist merely of a few hives set amidst environs as lethal as a fair number of death worlds. It is not a place that suffers fools lightly. To travel the Calixis Sector unprepared is to engage in protracted suicide. While a reliable weapon (or two, or three, or… well… many) is a good idea, no amount of force will hold off the deathly cold of Soryth or quench one's thirst amidst the Soot Warrens of Tranch. There are bioforms on Dusk that no Magos Biologis has ever heard of, and there are predators on Fedrid that would think nothing of consuming a Land Raider whole—with the right equipment one can come away from dealing with either relatively unscathed. As with all things else within the Imperium, knowledge is power. On the frontier, preparing to deal with the myriad of environments that one can and will face is at least as important as knowing how to fight. T

# Armour Armour

*"I've heard the vast number of hivers will never see the sky of their own home world, save once perhaps, the day they leave it forever as a member of the Imperial Guard. Having spent the greater bulk of my life under hostile alien skies that have frequently tried to kill me, I can say with some confidence that they haven't missed a thing."*

— Nikus Monns, Mercenary.

#### **Environmental Body Glove**

The rare travellers of the Imperium often despair over the many environments they must prepare for as they travel between systems. Bulky void suits are frequently impractical, especially when a given world's atmosphere is known to be merely unpleasant as opposed to fatal, and few are the sealed suits that actually provide any armour to their wearers. Travellers on the frontier have an especially difficult time of it, for if they discover a planet with unexpected environmental conditions, the proper equipment may be long months or even years of travel away. Several of the worthies of the various Malfian noble houses decided that the situation was intolerable and set about designing a series of body gloves designed to withstand multiple extreme conditions while still maintaining their wearer in relative comfort. The suits were a great success and various models are produced in small quantities on Malfi, Vaxanide, and Scintilla. "Environmental body glove" is a generic name for a wide variety of suits. Most are actually named after the house line that produces them, such as the "Mariette Envelope" or the "Hax Hostile" field body glove.

Environmental body gloves are full body suits designed to sustain their wearers at a constant temperature, despite external conditions, making them ideal as outerwear for desert worlds and a useful inner layer for particularly cold environments. Pockets within the suits recycle sweat and other bodily fluids, cooling or warming them as necessary, in order to regulate temperature and provide emergency water rations. The suits are waterproof, which makes them useful in marshy terrain and capable of doubling as a wetsuit when necessary. Environmental body gloves add +1 Armour Point to all locations and grant a +10 bonus on Survival Tests.

Such suits are almost invariably equipped with a re-breather, comm-bead and photo-contacts.

#### **Slither Boots**

There are a number of polluted environments within the Calixis Sector where the very soil itself is both destructive and toxic. Whether one has to trudge within the salt-fens of Acreage, over the acid storm wastes of Grangold, or through one of the deadly slime jungles of Vaxanide, the journey will be a short one if the ground itself eats away a traveller's footwear directly exposing them to their surrounding's toxicity—a common and frequently deadly occurrence for the unprepared. The destitute that live within such places cope as best they can, whilst the wealthy few acquire slither boots.

Slither boots are highly advanced footwear, incorporating a variety of materials including ceramite-woven leather and a circuitry embedded inner frame. Slither boots are designed to withstand the most hostile of environments, releasing chemicals to shield the wearer from acidic and alkaline environments. Slither boots do not slip; regardless of how tractionless a surface may seem, small tendrils emerge from the soles of the boots to help compensate for the movements of their wearer.

Slither boots provide a +10 bonus to Agility Tests made to maintain footing in treacherous or slick conditions and provide 6 AP (Legs) versus corrosives.

#### **Wind Armour**

A seemingly fanciful name for a suit of protective gear that deals with a very real problem, wind armour is produced by the Fane of Doru on Scintilla for the many worlds of the Calixis Sector that boast powerful storms. The infamous Splinter Winds of Barsapine travel at over 700 kilometres an hour and are more than capable of stripping a lightly armoured person to bone in less than 30 seconds. Against such force, even void shields are hard pressed to cope. Realizing that standing against the wind was ultimately foolhardy, the designers came up with a clever idea of creating a series of auto-reactive ceramsteel plates that would redirect wind force, allowing an individual to advance in lighter dust storms and, at the least, survive in the heavier ones.

Wind armour is formed from fully enclosed suits of medium articulated carapace. They incorporate a series of heavy air filters with a re-breather connected to an extra tank, allowing a wearer to breathe normally in all but the heaviest storms, with three full hours of breath should they be completely buried in dust. Each suit also has an inbuilt vox-system along with a photo-visor. Wind armour was primarily designed to defend its wearer from harsh environmental conditions, not opponents. While it is popular with explorers, it isn't nearly as useful in a fight as many other armours of similar class.

The wearer is immune to environmental effects of strong wind and dire storms.

<span id="page-152-0"></span>*"The key to overcoming failure is never accepting it."* — Magos Genetus Halix Redole.

#### **Aerial Pinions**

A somewhat misnamed apparatus, aerial pinions were not designed to allow a user to soar through the air, but rather to prevent divers from sinking to their deaths in the chemical oceans of Landunder. The "hanging" colonies of Landunder are mounted on the undersides of the planet's continents floating upon a vast chemical sea. Chemical mining, research and undercity maintenance must all be done "outside", which is when aerial pinions are employed. A set of pinions resembles a webbed body harness festooned with articulated blades each of which is connected to a coiled, reinforced ceramite line. The lines are in turn attached to small motors that contain integral highly specialised logic-engines. A diver using a set of aerial pinions typically connects two or more lines into the city or ground above, using the blades as either grappling hooks or spiking them deep into the crust of the planet, as the pinion's logic-engines dictate. Most harnesses support four blade-and-line sets, allowing a user to set two lines, while using the other two for cautious movement. Skilled users eventually upgrade to a six blade-and-line set and are capable of moving at truly remarkable speeds. A fully extended set of aerial pinions resembles a great pair of wings from a distance, hence the name.

There are rumours of acrobatic individuals finding uses for aerial pinions far from the chemical oceans of Landunder. There is no shortage of dark places where it would be useful to hide, unobserved and unsuspected, on many worlds. The upper shadows of a hive city are an excellent spot for an agile aerial pinion-equipped assassin to attack from. A character using aerial pinions can move at half his normal rate, but can neither Run nor Charge. A character using the advanced six blade-and-line aerial pinions can make an Agility Test in order to move at normal rates for as long as he wishes, until he comes to a stop. A separate Agility Test is required to use a Run or Charge Action. Failure indicates that one of the lines doesn't connect or one of the logic-engines fails momentarily, instantly halting the character. Three or more degrees of failure mean that the character has overstretched his aerial pinions' lines and become unmoored. On Landunder, that means he's sinking; elsewhere that he is probably falling.

#### **Beetle Tent**

The Cestelle Alliance was instrumental in the original creation of a series of collapsible bio-dome structures now known as "beetle tents" due to their distinctly insectoid profile, an easy to assemble portable bio-dome formed from polycarbonate sidings reinforced with plasteel rods. While not as easily transportable as a shelter made from cloth, beetle tents are far more durable in the face of hostile creatures and uncertain weather. Beetle tents have since passed into common use and are greatly favoured by officers of the Imperial Guard. The Cestelle Alliance's manufactora remain the largest producers of beetle tents in the sector, creating them in a variety of shapes and sizes. All of the Cestelle's bio-dome structures are modular, allowing them to be linked into larger structures as necessary. The exterior of a beetle tent invariably includes some sort of camouflage scheme, usually a jungle-based one, though desert camouflage is also common. Beetle tents have AP 8 (Primitive), though they can be reinforced with armoured panels for travellers expecting to encounter particularly hostile native fauna. There are two sizes of tent listed, holding up to a maximum of three or six adult humans respectively. The Extra Armour upgrade for a beetle tent increases its AP value to 12.

#### **Calixis Survival Kit**

One of the most basic pieces of gear any traveller should have, a survival kit contains a wide variety of equipment and supplies, all of which are intended to help their users survive in less than optimal conditions. Generally, if the owner of a survival kit is forced to rely upon their kit's contents, something has gone wrong—a particularly deadly prospect on an alien world. Several trade guilds within the Calixis Sector manufacture portable survival kits, with the ones produced by Haal-Lorden of Cantus particularly favoured, as that guild has held a contract to produce kits for the Imperial Guard for several centuries. There are many variants to be had and well-travelled users frequently tailor their personal survival kits to the specific environments they intend to find themselves within. A typical kit includes: two blade razors, an igniter, a Helite flexible wire saw, 14 multi-shape fishing hooks, five press weight lures, 25 metres of heavy fishing line, 1 very large hook, 10-metres brass snare wire, 1 highpowered pocket illuminator, one calibrated button compass with a Calixis Sector world specific guide page, four doses of stimm, six Alozith tabs (Alozith is a strong general-purpose antibiotic), 20 Ionis water purifying tablets, two flexi bags, one metre adhesive tape, three metres long Spinlin cord, half a metre of reinforced ceramite-woven tape, three metres of cotton sewing thread, three sewing needles of various sizes, one surgical needle, eight safety fasteners of various sizes, a metre square piece of foil, one narrow-quill with Watersure ink, two sheets of rolled Sure-Write paper, a mirror-finished plasteel case to hold the kit's contents and serve as an impromptu signalling device.

Survival kits add a +10 bonus to Survival Tests—the kit itself doesn't supply knowledge of how to survive, but it can provide the tools to do so.

#### **Camp Warders**

Travellers to the feral worlds of the sector often choose devices that encourage passing hostile native creatures to go elsewhere and without a fight if possible. One of the more sophisticated of these is the elegant camp warder, a small techno-arcane device with an appearance reminiscent of clockwork scorpions. Data-linked to a screamer (see page 151 of Dark Heresy), camp warders are buried within the soil surrounding a campsite. When the screamer detects an intruder, instead of releasing an audible signal it sends a silent alarm to the camp warders, which immediately converge on the intruder by swiftly burrowing underground towards it. Upon arrival, the camp warders begin quickly stabbing their tails up out of the soil into the intruder. The camp warders then begin "herding" the creature away from the main campsite with continuous painful jabs. While this doesn't cause any real damage, the frightening nature of the unseen assailants cause any being with the Bestial trait to immediately attempt a Hard (–20) Willpower Test or flee the area protected by the camp warders.

The listed cost includes a modified screamer and half a dozen camp warders.

#### **Redole Re-breather**

Widely considered amidst the greater triumphs of a muchcelebrated career, one of the legendary Magos Genetus Halix Redole's final contributions to the Imperium was an alternate form of re-breather that followed the philosophies by which he lived his life. Unsatisfied with what he deemed to be the "dual and therefore unfocused" use of the standard Imperial re-breather, Redole set out to create a device that would allow a user to stay underwater for a greater period of time than its predecessor. Instead of using purely mechanical components, Redole integrated vat-grown flesh versions of piscine gills with a series of increasingly complex helmets till he found the combination he sought. The Redole Re-breather is a helmet that literally draws breathable oxygen from the water around it, allowing a user to stay underwater indefinitely. As long as a Redole Re-breather's flesh components are kept wet, each has a functional life of around a decade before needing to be replaced. Even so, due to the effort and materials required to create one, only nobles and their elite cadres can afford to use them. Note that unlike a "standard" re-breather, Redole's device provides no protection against harmful air-born toxins as it only functions underwater.

#### **Poi-Savant**

Spending time in xeno environments means that sooner or later one will have to sample the "local" cuisine, which may not resemble anything one is used to. Indeed, some travellers try to opt for a plant or creature that has a "familiar" appearance, but this is no less dangerous—for the assumption that a given thing must be safe to eat based on resemblance is a foolhardy one. Enter the poi-savant. A hand-held cogitation device, the poi-savant measures various levels of bio-chemicals and searches for signs of a diverse number of dangerous toxins in any substance that it is used to analyse. Any substance the poi-savant clears as "edible" is safe for human consumption, though not necessarily appetizing.

Originally developed on Malfi, where the noble houses even now use them at every meal, poi-savants tend to be remarkably accurate devices as they have had well over a thousand years of field-testing. Indeed, many Malfian nobles make a point of commissioning their own personally tailored poi-savant, generally by miniaturizing them into elegant wands or ornate rings that they can simply pass over

their meals without appearing unduly concerned (or rude). Personal poi-savants must be updated regularly as new toxins are identified, leading to an ongoing race between their cogitators and the cunning of the countless assassins who constantly seek out new poisons in the hope that they will thwart their target's poi-savant. Poi-savants were specifically designed to be easy to use; their operator need only make a Routine (+20) Tech-Use Test to employ them correctly. A failed Test gives inconclusive readings, while a failure by three or more degrees indicates that a blameless substance is toxic or vice versa (GM decision).

#### **Shade-Servitor**

Hot environments are often doubly dangerous to travellers because they can compel visitors to a new planet to strip off their armour in order to withstand the heat, almost invariably a fatal mistake. Shade-servitors have no organic parts and are not, in fact, servitors in the strict Imperial sense of the word. They are relatively small devices resembling a cone surmounted by a series of ceramic lamellar blades that swiftly rotate in different directions. The devices hover about their master, using their blades as natural fans and parasols, occasionally supplemented with a cold blast of air sent over an internal cooling coil. Shade servitors have a small internal battery with a 12-hour reserve that constantly recharges via a series of photonic cells along their blades, allowing them to function near ceaselessly in hot, sunlit environments.

A shade-servitor is as much a statement of wealth as a practical device. They do assist in removing penalties due to heat and help to fend off Fatigue in hot environments (GMs discretion). Otherwise, they are merely a clear indicator of a given individual's wealth and tend to be adorned with intricate wood engravings or careful scrimshaw work. There are rumours of severely upgraded models, ones capable of hurling their blades to inflict lethal cuts or installed with a powered shield, but the veracity of such rumours is difficult to confirm.

#### **Sky Eye**

A techno-arcane device of great sophistication, a sky eye incorporates a small hovering sphere slightly less than two fingers wide with an elegant docking station containing a variety of holo-display modules. The sphere scouts out a chosen area within 15 kilometres of the docking station, a process that can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on the distances involved and the level of stealth asked of the sphere component. Upon the eye's return, the docking station produces perfect three-dimensional holomaps of the scouted area that can be downloaded to standard data-slates. Within the Calixis Sector, only the Adeptus Mechanicus brethren of the Lathes are known to be capable of producing such devices. Rumour has it the Inquisition has access to ultra-quiet sky eyes that incorporate camouflaging materials, which they use to scout out the interiors of rooms and buildings before entering.

The sky eye drone is a Minuscule object that can sustain only a single point of Damage before it is destroyed. It has the Flyer (8) trait. Attempts to detect the sky eye either by sight or hearing are at a –30 penalty.

#### <span id="page-154-0"></span>**Thermal Gloves**

To coreward of the Adrantis sub-sector lies the unique mining colony world of Soryth, an icy satellite famous for its rare frozen gas deposits. While the miners of Soryth are a hardy lot, the precision required for their work with tools is impossible to achieve with ice-numbed hands. A single spark from a misplaced strike can be fatal (and costly) in the sub-zero gas mines; so thermal gloves are somewhat of a necessity.

Thermal gloves are slender but sturdy gauntlets; thin enough to allow for delicate manipulation and lined with an assortment of circuitry that keeps them comfortably warm despite external weather. The power cells are incorporated into thin forearm shields in order to protect them from the elements. The energy in these cells can be used to power-up emergency ports on other equipment and, when doing so, provide a +10 bonus to Tech-Use Tests to restart generators, power up old data-slates and similar tasks. A full discharge from the generator cells can also be used to part-recharge a lasgun or laspstol clip as well, providing 1D5 shots of charge before draining the power cells entirely.

### Drugs & Substances Drugs & Su bstan ces

#### **Dryas (Drug)**

Dryas is a compound originally derived from a series of desert dwelling lizards native to the agri-world of Dreah, synthesized by Mechanicus explorators and available commercially as an emergency survival tool. Dryas causes biochemical changes in the human body enabling extended periods of survival in arid atmospheres or when there is no fresh water. Side effects of taking dryas include atrophied taste and smell, and a very unpleasant sense of weakness and lassitude. Few take dryas without an extreme need to do so.

A single dose of dryas lasts for three days. During that time, the character taking it receives a +20 bonus to Survival Tests made in arid environments and he requires only half of his usual water intake. However, he suffers a –10 penalty to all Strength and Perception based Tests while under its influence. In addition, those under its effects also suffer a –5 penalty to all Fellowship based Tests due to their slurred speech and vacant manner. Dryas is not addictive, but extended use can cause permanent systemic damage.

#### **Polygum**

*"Wot can yer do with it? Ha! Easier to figure out wot yer can't do with it, eh?"*

— Hrobe Dolson, Polygum Harvester.

A remarkable substance discovered by accident within the wide verdant forests of Ganf Magna, polygum was stumbled upon several centuries ago by a group of frontier farmers in the midst of an engagement with a large tribe of the feral Orks that continue to infest their planet in present times. Their weapons' fire had opened up the boles of a number of ancient trees, which proceeded to exude a thick sap. In between bouts of combat, one of the farmers observed that wherever the sap had blended with the dust of the dark purple lichen that covered the tree, it had ceased to flow. He soon discovered that the resulting matter had somewhat the consistency of rubber, but that it could be stretched and readily retained whatever shapes it was formed into. At first a useful curiosity, polygum drew even more positive attention when analysis indicated that it had substantive antibacterial properties, presumably due to its lichen component.

Polygum can, and has, been used to form countess items, though tarps, ponchos and makeshift slings are the most prevalent. It readily serves as a weather sealant and a few techpriests have been known to bless polygum in order to employ it as a suitable makeshift repair substance for holding machine parts together. An individual with the Medicae skill can employ a ball of polygum to automatically staunch a bleeding wound without a Test and it also serves as an excellent dressing. however, such use causes the polygum to crumble soon after. Polygum is now used throughout the sector, though its rarity makes it costly. It is one of Ganf Magna's sole exports and it is sent forth in small, cylindrical, carved wood containers.
