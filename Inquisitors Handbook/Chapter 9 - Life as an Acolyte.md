# Chapter IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### <span id="page-217-0"></span>**Does the Alter Ego have any special powers?**

This is an important part of an alter ego and one most likely to test its strength. If an identity is just used for hiding, it probably doesn't need to do anything special: for example, "Dufra the hab worker" is good to use when you don't want to be noticed, but she certainly doesn't have any kind of special clearance or authority. Pretending to be a PDF lieutenant or even a planetary governor can put all sorts of options at your fingertips, though they are markedly harder to get away with. Any kind of special abilities related to an alter ego should be discussed with the GM.

#### **Do you need to do anything to maintain the Alter Ego?**

Do you need to keep in contact with anyone, log reports or make appearances to keep your alter ego alive? This is important for identities with any kind of authority, special access or those who are very "visible". You might find that your secret identities come with responsibilities and obligations that must be honoured in order to keep them from getting into trouble.

#### **How often do you use the identity?**

How often you use an identity often directly relates to how real it is. In some cases, you might use an alternative persona more than your real one. In fact, it is even possible that your fellow Acolytes don't know for sure who you really are

#### **Example**

*John wants to create an alter ego for his character Morden in order to be able to travel to the world of Sentinel unnoticed. As a shrine world, Sentinel sits on one of the many pilgrim trails that criss-cross the sector. John therefore decides that Morden's alternative identity is a pilgrim. Firstly, he comes up with a name, Horpus Feldor. He then creates a sad story about how Horpus lost his family to the Simpering Rot on Scintilla and how he donned the pilgrim's mantle to find peace. Finally, John spends some Thrones on various pilgrim medallions and badges to complete the disguise. Thus Horpus the Pilgrim is born.*

#### **Buying Alter Egos** Buying Alter Egos

While an alternative identity is more about roleplaying rather than hard rules, if it affords your PC significant powers above and beyond what they could normally employ, the GM may require an xp cost to pay for it. This should be rare, and only if the identity is one you can use in almost every game session. For example, if the Acolyte was believed to be a high level Administratum Overseer and he used his connections in every game to gain information he would not normally have access to, this is a strong advantage that should require the player to spend xp upon. Of course, if he was merely a bounty hunter with the right to claim money for bringing in the occasional criminal, this is not really a great benefit to the player beyond being a way to hide his character's true persona.

When determining the cost of such connection and abilities, the GM can use the cost for contacts as a guide (see [page 220\).](#page-220-0)

More often, the cost of having an alter ego is only monetary, for such things as false IDs, records, disguises and bribes. In such cases, the player may decide how little or how much money they wish to spend in creating the identity. The GM should consider the Difficulty of obtaining these things when working out the price, taking into account the Skills and Talents that the Acolyte might be able to use to obtain them (such as underworld contacts, scribing skills for forgery and so on).

#### **Using an Alter Ego**

Whenever you are to deal with someone, you must decide what identity you will use. This is especially true when you travel from one place to another or first enter a new locale such as an organisation or a hive. The GM should decide how curious people are about you and how good your alter ego really is.

An Acolyte talking to people in a bar could give a false name and be fairly confident that most of the patrons would not think to question him (mostly because they wouldn't care). Even if someone was looking for him, unless they have a detailed description, a false name would be enough. However, if the Acolyte wanted to make contact with a local gang in the same bar, he might be subjected to far greater scrutiny.

If at any time the GM decides that the alter ego is coming under scrutiny, he may require the player to make a Charm, Blather, Deceive or Disguise Test. The GM should determine if any bonuses apply, depending on how detailed the player has made their identity, or what penalties must be taken into consideration for how suspicious the questioner is. Typically though, even someone on their guard will accept an identity if it seems genuine enough and if it can be "backed-up".

Should the identity be tested in other ways, such as checking official ID, seeing if they exist on records or taking genetic scans, it comes down to how many of these bases the Acolyte has covered. Clever Acolytes have at least one form of officially endorsed ID and one credible person somewhere to vouch for them, as this is usually enough to convince most authorities. Again, the GM will determine what, if any, bonuses or penalties should be applied to Tests. Typically, the more a player has spent (in terms of xp and/or money) will provide a greater Test bonus, in addition to how well the player has "maintained" the persona (where the alter ego is a long-standing or well-known personality).

# Contacts Contacts

<span id="page-218-0"></span>*"I know a guy who talked to this enforcer that arrested this girl who had a drink with this other guy who swears he saw Drusus's ghost down on hab level three two nights ago."*

— Ungel Slib, Information Broker.

Amidst the undulating sea of humanity, Acolytes find a myriad of citizens they can utilize for their own ends. Whether it is because of their position, influence or special talents, these people can provide an Acolyte with things they could not otherwise obtain, possibly even with the weight of the Inquisition at their back. Over time, an Acolyte may even create a web of such people, hailing from diverse worlds and backgrounds, to act as allies and informants throughout the sector. However, finding a range of good contacts can be a full time task, as is keeping them. A

#### **What is a Contact?** What is a Contact?

A contact is anyone the Acolyte knows that is willing to provide information, equipment or favours. This might be out of the goodness of their own heart, because they feel obligated to the Acolyte or perhaps it is for money or favours in return. Contacts might be individuals, groups or even entire Adeptus. Acolytes may even cultivate members of the Inquisition as contacts, which could be other Acolytes (though not PCs) or other Inquisitors. Fundamentally, to be considered a contact, the NPC must have some kind of relationship with the Acolyte and must be able to provide him with something useful in game play.

#### **Creating a Contact** Creating a Contact

During the course of their career an Acolyte comes into contact with countless people, not all of them intent of killing him. Some of these may be ripe for cultivation as contacts. There are two main ways in which a Player Character might gain a contact: either when they first create their character or during play by meeting likely NPCs. In both cases, it is up to the GM to approve a contact for the game, though in the latter case the player can choose whether or not to turn an NPC into a contact. When a contact is created, whether it is by the GM or by the player, you can use the following questions to help you determine who they are and what they can offer the Acolyte.

#### **Who is the Contact?**

More than their name, you need to decide whether the contact is an individual, a group or something larger. For instance, having the ear of Sabius Gout the local Enforcer Captain is different from being able to receive favours from all enforcers in Hive Secondus on Malfi.

#### **How powerful is the Contact?**

This is probably the most important aspect of your contact. Most contacts will only be able to provide limited information or help specific to their area of expertise and almost never beyond the bounds of their world. For instance, a colonel in the Barsapine PDF, while quite powerful within the ranks of the general military, would have limited influence with other organisations on Barsapine and none beyond its borders.

#### **What can the Contact give you?**

The easiest commodity, and often the most useful, is information. However, a contact might also be able to get cheap or difficult to find equipment. Some might even be able to provide items not normally available within the Imperium. Contacts could also provide favours, ranging from something as simple as putting in a good word with their bosses up to "lending" out an Imperial Guard infantry battalion.

#### **What is your relationship to the Contact?**

Your relationship with your contact is the result of many factors, such as how you came to find and "recruit" them, their social background in contrast to yours and how you intend to use them in the future. In most cases, the Acolyte exploits the contact's obligation to the Emperor or their greed. Sometimes an Acolyte may form a bond with a contact and they come to be close friends. Equally, some contacts may actually hate the Acolyte and only "serves" them out of fear or for the chance to one day get even for some past slight or harm.

Some contacts might adore you while others hate your guts. How the contact regards you aids the GM in portraying your contact appropriately, as well as shaping the contact's general actions. It is worth mentioning, that whether or not a contact likes you does not have to affect their trustworthiness or reliability. Someone who hates you might still take pride in their work and do a good job, while someone who loves you might do something misguided.

#### **How trustworthy is the Contact?**

Stemming from the Acolyte's relationship with the contact is their trustworthiness. While ultimately it is up to the GM to decide just how loyal a contact is, a PC may already have a fair idea, especially if they continually treat the contact badly. While many players might reject the idea of using a contact they cannot fully trust, sometimes the benefits they offer make it worth the risk.

#### **How did you meet the Contact?**

This is an important question for helping the GM to decide where the contact "fits" into the game. Most contacts don't travel about (though they may be contactable from a great distance) and in all probability live somewhere within the Calixis Sector. Where they live and how you came to meet them will give you an idea of the role they might play in the future.

#### **Do any of your fellow Acolytes know about the Contact?**

Contacts are often personal things and while an Acolyte might share the information he gains grouping order for the group to meet its objectives, it is unlikely he will let others make use of his "special" sources. Clever Acolytes keep their contacts to themselves, but you need to decide whether others in your group may be aware of your connections.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Example**

*John wants to create a contact for his PC—Morden—that can get him high-spec weapons. Working with the GM, he decides that Morden's contact is an arms merchant from Gunmetal City, named Kout. Kout owns his own shop but beyond that has little power or influence. He can offer information (only pertinent to Gunmetal City), but is mostly useful for procuring arms. They met when Morden was investigating arms smuggling between the hives of Scintilla and he used the information he gained to "convince" Kout to work for him. Kout does not like him very much but Morden doesn't care as long as he gets what he needs.*

#### **Contact Reliability**

Some contacts are more reliable than others and some are downright dangerous to associate with. The quality of a contact determines such things as how frequently you can use them and just how good the services they provide are. There are three grades of contact: Trusted, Common and Dubious.

#### **Trusted**

Some rare contacts actually like the Acolyte and may even have become fast friends with them. These are people who assist out of duty and honour and go to great lengths to provide help. A Trusted contact in the right place at right time can be worth more that a squad of storm troopers.

A Trusted contact can be used as many times as the Acolyte likes, provided he has some way of getting in touch with them. If the Acolyte is actually operating in the contact's immediate locale, it is even more likely that he will be able to provide good information or access to equipment, as well as being freer with favours.

#### **Common**

Most contacts fall into this category. These are contacts who, on the whole, are reliable and able to offer good information or equipment, though, they don't usually go out of their way for the Acolyte.

A Common contact can be used once per game session provided the Acolyte has some way of getting in touch with him. If the GM decides that he should play a larger role in the adventure (i.e. the Acolyte's mission is taking place in the contact's immediate locale), you might be able to use the contact more than once.

#### **Dubious**

Some contacts are of questionable value or who are mostly unreliable. These are contacts that either don't like the Acolyte and who resent being used or are simply fickle by nature. They can sometimes offer good quality information and access to equipment, but there is a greater chance that they will be unhelpful.

A Dubious contact can be used once per game session provided the Acolyte has some way of getting in touch with them. Unlike Common contacts, there is a greater chance they provide false or misleading information.

### **Example**

*John and the GM decide that Kout, even though he doesn't like John's character, is a solid individual that knows his trade well. This makes him a Common contact—far from the Acolyte's best friend, but reliable nevertheless.*

#### <span id="page-220-0"></span>**Buying Contacts** Buying Contacts

Whether gained through play or during character creation, GMs may require players to pay a cost in xp for their contacts, especially if they are particularly useful and give them an advantage. Once you have decided who your contact is and what he can do for you, use Table 9-1: Pricing Contacts to work out how many of these benefits apply and add up the cost in Experience Points. Some aspects of a contact will reduce their overall cost, but no reduction in price can make a contact worth less than 0 xp.

| Table 9-1: Pricing Contacts               |                |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Contact…                                  | xp Cost        |

| *PC must have related Peer talent.        |                |

#### **Contact is an Individual**

**Cost:** 10

The contact is a single named individual, such as an Arbitraitor or Administratum clerk. He might be powerful within his position, however he remains a single person and the Acolyte can only deal with him. Individuals are the most common kind of contact, though also the most vulnerable.

#### **Contact is a Group Cost:** 50

The contact is a group of some kind, usually limited to a specific place or world. This could be an underhive gang or a cult. Like an individual, a group is usually limited to influencing a single area of expertise or locale. However, they enjoy several benefits over individuals. These include added resources and the advantage of being less vulnerable to the Acolyte's foes.

#### **Contact is an Adeptus**

#### **Cost:** 200

**Special:** You must have a related Peer talent.

The contact is an arm of the Imperium. This could include such star-spanning organisations as the Ministorum or the Adeptus Arbites. Unlike other kinds of contacts, adeptus have vast resources and power covering many worlds. While having an adeptus as a contact does not automatically guarantee that every member of the organisation will be disposed to helping the Acolyte, it gives him much greater access than he would normally enjoy. Adeptus are also the most resilient kind of contacts as they are practically impossible to destroy.

#### **Contact has Military Connections Cost:** 50

The contact has access to military forces or equipment. This could be because he is part of the Imperial Guard, local PDF or some other kind of paramilitary organisation. Contacts with military ties have greater access to weapons and equipment as well as classified information. In addition, the contact can sometimes offer direct military assistance in the form of Guardsmen, fighting vehicles or even warships.

#### **Contact has Special Powers**

**Cost:** 200

The contact has some kind of special power, such as the unquestionable authority of an Inquisitor or the mental powers of a psyker. The contact can perform special feats that would normally be beyond the ability of the Acolyte. Such contacts are rare and difficult to find.

#### **Contact has a Skill**

#### **Cost:** 10 per Skill

The contact has a useful Skill. Usually this will be Inquiry when trying to gather information but it can also include such things as a Common, Scholastic or Forbidden Lore. At the GMs discretion, it may also include more unusual Skills. Note that the Acolyte does not need to possess the Skill for the contact to make use of it.

#### **Contact is an expert in a Skill**

**Cost:** 20 per Skill

The contact has expertise in one or more Skill (Skill Mastery). Experts gain a +20 Test bonus when using the Skill.

#### **Contact has a Skill Group**

#### **Cost:** 50 per Skill Group

The contact has a complete Group of Skills, usually all Common, Scholastic or Forbidden Lore skills. With the GMs approval, your contact could have a more unusual range of abilities. However, these must either be all from the same Skill Group or be closely related. Note that the Acolyte does not need to possess any of these Skills for the contact to make use of them.

#### **Contact is an expert in a Skill Group Cost:** 50 per Group

The contact has expertise in a Skill Group (Skill Mastery). Experts gain a +20 Test bonus when using any of the Skills in their Skill Group.

#### **I used to know someone…**

At the discretion of the GM, an Acolyte's Career Path may also play a role in how they make contacts. Obviously it is going to be easier and make more sense for an ex-Imperial Guardsman to know someone still serving in the army, just as an Arbitraitor is going to have more reason to still deal with the Adeptus Arbites. In these cases, if the player can come up with a plausible story as to why he as a contact that relates directly to his background, you can reduce the contact's cost. Typically this kind of background contact should cost 50% of the normal price. The advantage of giving this kind of discount is that it creates a more logical and believable spread of contacts throughout the group and each character will have his own fields of speciality. After all, if you want to contact a hive gang who better to ask than the Scum character. GMs should be careful, however, of players who come up with far-fetched stories to allow them cheaper access to particular kinds of contacts that do not really fit into their background.

#### **Contact is able to reduce an item's Availability**

#### **Cost:** 10 per level

The contact can reduce the Availability of a particular kind of equipment (such as tools or drugs), ranged weapons, melee weapons or armour. This advantage can be purchased in up to three levels.

Example: If your PC was trying to acquire a Rare item, a contact with one level of this advantage would reduce it to Scarce, two levels would reduce it to Average and three levels would reduce it to Common.

#### **Contact can reduce an item's price**

**Cost:** 20 per 10%

The contact can reduce the cost of a particular kind of equipment (such as tools or drugs), ranged weapons, melee weapons or armour. This advantage can be bought in up to three levels.

#### **Example**

*If your PC was trying to purchase a long las (cost 100), a contact with one level of this advantage would reduce the cost to 90, two levels would reduce it to 80 and three levels would reduce it to 70.*

#### **Contact is able to reduce all Availability Cost:** 50 per degree

The contact can reduce the Availability of any equipment. This advantage can be bought in up to three levels and otherwise works as above.

#### **Contact is able to reduce all prices**

#### **Cost:** 100 per 10%

The contact can reduce the cost of any equipment. This advantage can be bought in up to three levels and otherwise works as above.

#### **Contact offers Favours Cost:** 150

The contact can offer favours. A favour does not need to be specified when the contact is created. However, each time you ask your contact for a favour, he is less likely to grant it. Favours are always something that is reasonably within the power of the contact to grant and the GM has the final say on what favours are offered. Favours are covered in more detail on [page 223.](#page-223-0)

#### **Contact is Trusted**

#### **Cost:** 100

The contact is Trusted. He can be used as often as the player likes and are very reliable. Favours from Trusted contacts are also easier to obtain and are more impressive than those from other kinds of contacts.

#### **Contact is Common**

**Cost:** 0

The contact is Common. He can be used at least once a game session and is reasonably reliable.

#### **Contact is Dubious**

#### **Cost:** –50

The contact is Dubious. He can be used only once a game session and there is a greater chance that he provides false (or just plain wrong) information or flawed equipment. Favours from Dubious contacts are few and far between and usually not to be trusted should they manifest.

#### **Contact is Dangerous**

#### **Cost:** –100

The contact is dangerous to use. Every time the contact is used for information, equipment or favours there is a chance it could all go horribly wrong.

#### **Example**

*John decides that Kout can offer both a little information and access to weapons. Though Kout owns his own shop and has a network of contacts himself, he is still an individual (+10). He finds out information for the Acolyte, thus he has the Inquiry skill (+10). He can make ranged weapons two degrees easier to find (+20) and reduce the cost of ranged weapons by 20% (+40); Kout is also a Common Contact (+0). John decides that Kout does not like his character enough to offer any favours. Thus Kout costs John's character a total of 80 xp.*

#### <span id="page-222-0"></span>**Using Your Contacts** Using Your Contacts

You may employ your contacts at any time by simply declaring their use to the GM. You may use your contact only a limited number of times each game session, depending on the contact's Reliability . The GM then decides how difficult this will be, depending on such factors as how far away the contact is (perhaps the other side of the sector) and your current access to communication. If it is reasonable for you to make contact (GMs should not be too harsh in restricting Acolyte's access to their contacts), you may ask your contact for information, equipment or a favour. If the GM wants, the interaction between Acolyte and contact can be roleplayed, with the player trying to ask the right questions of his contact or even trying to convince him to help. However, this should be in the interests of fun and shouldn't penalise players who are not as skilful negotiators as are their characters.

#### **Getting Information**

There are a number of ways the GM can handle requests for information. If the information is something the contact would know and is well within their ability to impart, the GM might simply pass it on to the player. For instance, a citizen would be able to tell the Acolyte all the local news pertaining to their home. If the information is harder to obtain, or secret in any way, the GM should Test the contact's Inquiry skill. Likewise, if the Acolyte is asking any kind of question that falls into the contact's area of expertise, such as Common, Scholastic and Forbidden Lore skills, the GM should also take a Test. These Tests are made from a base score of 40. This reflects the contact's training with the Skill as well as his connections and resources. The GM may add modifiers to this roll just like a normal Test to reflect the Difficulty or ease of the task requested.

It is also possible that a contact may provide misinformation, either intentionally or by mistake. If, after modifiers, the Test to acquire information fails by more than three degrees, the contact provides the Acolyte with a piece of false information. This can be anything the GM wants, from the merely misleading (providing confusing or nonsensical information) to the downright dangerous (sending the Acolyte into peril). Dubious contacts are more unreliable than most and any failed Skill Test from such a contact always provides false information.

Ultimately, it is important to remember that the GM always has the final say when deciding what information a contact can provide. After all, it would be somewhat of an anticlimax to solve a complex investigation just because Rynns from Hab Maintenance happened to pick up the head cultist's wallet.

#### **Equipment**

Getting equipment is much the same as finding information. The Acolyte requests a piece of equipment from his contact and then the contact makes an Inquiry Test (even if he does not have the Skill for the purposes of providing information) at 40. Use the rules for Availability from Dark Heresy (see page 125), remembering to adjust the item's Rarity depending on the ability of the contact. If successful, the contact finds the item and can provide it for the Acolyte at its cost, remembering as well to apply any discount afforded by the contact's ability.

It is possible for contacts to provide faulty equipment in the same way as false information. If a contact fails his Inquiry Test to find a piece of equipment by more than three degrees, the item the Acolyte is looking has something wrong with it. Typically this means that, if a weapon, it has a much greater chance of jamming (any miss will result in a Jam), or its Range or its clip capacity is reduced, if a drug, it inflicts 1d10 points of Damage when used, or if a scanner, it provides a false reading, and so on. An honest contact might tell the Acolyte about the item's faults and see if he still wants it at a reduced cost. Most contacts, however, sell it anyway and plead ignorance if the Acolyte demands a refund. Dubious contacts are more unreliable than most and any failed Inquiry Test by one or more degrees always provides faulty equipment.

At the GMs discretion, a contact capable of providing equipment may also be able to provide other items not normally available to the Acolyte (i.e. not listed in the Armoury). In these cases, the GM must assign a price and Availability to the item, usually Rare or Very Rare with a high cost. A contact's ability to make items easer to find or cheaper never applies when trying to procure such items. In addition, trying to get such items, especially if they are of xenos origin, can be very risky. Whenever a contact is used in this way it counts as being a Dangerous Contact.

In both cases, the GM makes all Tests secretly, thus the player cannot be sure of the quality of their information or item, or, perhaps, exactly why their contact is not being forthcoming.

#### **Example**

*John's character, Morden, travels to Gunmetal City. He wants to find out some information before he gets there. John tells the GM that Morden is contacting Kout to ask him about a particular gang, the Lock Blades, who operate in the city. Information on the Locks is not common knowledge, so Kout has to make an Inquiry Test. His base Skill is 40, but the GM decides that because of the merchant's ties to the underworld, and the fact that he sells guns regularly to gangs, the Test is Routine (+20). The GM secretly makes the roll and gets 97. Since he has failed by more than three degrees he provides John's character with some misleading information on the gang. Kout gives Morden a false location for the Lock Blades headquarters, which may well get him into trouble when he arrives…*

#### **Using Contacts in Downtime**

Contacts can also be used in downtime between adventures, and in the case of contacts that provide equipment, this is probably the most useful time to make use of them. So long as the Acolyte can reasonably get in touch with his contact (i.e. he is not trapped on some isolated world far from Imperial space), he should be allowed to make full use of the contact to get weapons, amour and other gear. The amount of equipment and how long it takes to arrive is up to the GM. As a rule of thumb, a player should not be able to procure more than two or three weapons or pieces of gear. The time it takes for the equipment to arrive is directly proportional to the distance currently between the Acolyte and his contact, which can sometime equate to weeks or months of ship transit time.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### <span id="page-223-0"></span>**Example**

*John's character wants a boltgun. Since it is between game sessions, John asks the GM if he can use his contact, Kout, to make it easier. Normally, a boltgun costs 500 Thrones and has an Availability of Very Rare. Because Morden is using Kout, the cost drops to 400 Thrones (–20%) and becomes Scarce (dropping two levels of Rarity). In addition, John can use Kout's Inquiry skill of 40 and the population of Gunmetal City (several million) to influence the roll. Normally the Difficulty of the Test to find a Scarce item would be Difficult (–10). However, the population of the city increase this to Routine (+20). These factors combined means that the GM Tests against 60 to see if Kout has a boltgun in stock.*

#### **Favours**

Favours are another commodity that contacts can sometimes peddle, though these are much rarer and harder to obtain. A favour can include anything within the contact's power to grant. This could include security clearances, the use of expensive or rare equipment and even personnel.

With a favour, the Acolyte can ask anything and it is up to the GM to decide whether or not the contact will (or even can) grant it. GMs should take into account such things as the relationship the contact has with the Acolyte and just how much trouble the contact might get into if he grants the favour. For some, especially small favours (such as providing transport across a hive or a bed for the night), the GM may not require a Test. This might also be the case if the contact wants to grant the favour. Mostly, however, the Acolyte just needs to convince the contact. To do this, the player must Test against Intelligence or Fellowship (though they can use appropriate Interaction Skills at the GMs discretion) adding +5 for every Rank he has. This Test can be modified as normal. If he passes, the contact provides the favour.

The first time the Acolyte asks his contact for a favour, he may make his Test at no penalty. However, for each successive time, the Acolyte takes a cumulative –10 penalty to the Test. For favours that do not require rolls, the GM might decide that after a certain number of times a Test will be required, applying penalties as normal from that point forward. Trusted contacts do not incur penalties on any rolls to grant favours, no matter how often they are asked. Finally, over a reasonable length of time (such as a mission that takes several gaming sessions), the GM should reset this penalty, reflecting the fact that the contact has not been asked for anything for a while and is more disposed to helping the Acolyte.

#### **Dangerous Contacts**

Some contacts are just hazardous to an Acolyte's health. A dangerous contact is one that could cause the Acolyte undue trouble whenever he is used. This could be for obvious reasons, such as the contact being a suspected rebel or heretic, or less obvious ones—perhaps he is a double agent or some kind of xenos in disguise. While a player can come up with reasons as to why his contact is dangerous, he might also choose to let the GM decide the reason and keep it secret.

#### **Example**

*Augustus has a contact in the Administratum. He wants to get some official records changed to cover up his activities. His contact in the Administratum is only of Common reliability so he is really going to have to spin a tale to get this done. Fortunately, he has never asked his contact for a favour before so he incurs no penalties on his Test. Augustus is a Rank 3 Imperial Psyker and has an Intelligence of 42. Using all his wits, he tries to convince his contact to help. He needs to roll under 57, (42 + 15 for his Rank of 3). He scores a 34, and gets the records changed, expunging his dark deeds.*

Whenever a player uses a dangerous contact, the GM should make an Opposed Test with the player (keeping his results secret). If the GM rolls equal to or higher than the player, in addition to the contact being unhelpful, something has gone amiss. This usually means that either the contact has turned on the Acolyte or has done something that will bring Imperial authorities down on his head. What exactly happens is up to the GM and he is encouraged to work it into the plot. This might include such things as mercenaries turning up to try and kill the Acolyte or an arrest warrant being issued by the Adeptus Arbites in his name. At the very least, it is a licence for the GM to make something go wrong for the Acolyte during the game session.

#### **Losing Contacts**

Contacts can sometimes be lost during play, either though roleplaying or as part of the GMs plot. This is usually the result of someone coming after the Acolyte or his Inquisitor. Players should bear in mind that their contacts are not untouchable and are encouraged to keep them secret and protected, possibly even from their own master. Unless the player is directly responsible for the loss of his contact (his actions either directly or indirectly leading to the contact's death), then he should either be allowed to gain a new contact of the same xp cost or be reimbursed the contact's xp cost.

#### **Burning Contacts**

In certain circumstances, a GM might allow a player to ask something of his contact that the contact is not normally willing to give, losing him in the process. This is called "burning a contact". When a contact is burnt, he is doing the Acolyte "one last favour" and usually tries to do his best. If a contact is burnt for equipment or information, no roll is needed to find the item (though it must still be paid for) or to acquire the information (though he still cannot learn things he would not normally be able to). When burning a contact for a favour the player can add +30 bonus to the Test (no penalties should be applied). Once a contact is gone, he is gone forever and players do not regain xp lost in this way.

# Expanded Skills Exp anded Skills

*"The purpose of this instruction is not to deepen your understanding, but rather to broaden it. Ignorance, friends, is a virtue."* — Hyrum IX, to his students.

<span id="page-224-0"></span>Dark Heresy explores a broad range of Skills available to Acolytes, each of which offers a variety of uses and applications. The entries in the core rulebook, though, are just a foundation and as can be seen here, there are many more uses for the most common Skills. The expanded Skill entries that follow offer additional functions for Skills and are available to all characters. D

#### **Acrobatics (Advanced, Movement) Agility**

Useful for the Acolyte on the move, Acrobatics can be used in numerous situations to negate obstacles and circumvent treacherous conditions. Acrobatics can also provide a definitive edge when facing less agile foes.

#### **Hot Pursuit**

Normally, chasing after an opponent or fleeing from a pursuer is an Opposed Agility Test. To the acrobatic Acolyte, however, the environment can be a valuable tool, an advantage that allows the Acolyte to leap over railings, run along aerial walkways, jump across rooftops and careen down staircases. Whenever you are engaged in a pursuit through a congested area—crowds, difficult terrain, and so on, you may make an Acrobatics Test (in place of your Agility Test) for the Opposed Test.

#### **Negotiating Obstacles**

To a skilled acrobat, every obstacle is an opportunity, and every obstruction a challenge instead of a barrier. Whenever you Charge or Run through treacherous

#### **Pursuits**

At some time a character is bound to find himself involved in a chase, pursuing or being pursued by unfriendly heretics. This can be a thrilling component to roleplaying games, especially those involving dangerous environments, but such encounters can be a chore to run. To resolve pursuit simply, use the following rules.

#### **A Pursuit Dissected**

All pursuits occur in Detailed Time, so participants roll for Initiative and move as described in Dark Heresy. Where pursuit differs from normal combat encounters is in the tracking of Pursuit Points.

After rolling for Initiative, the character that acts first gains 1 Pursuit Point. On their Turn, each character involved in the pursuit, may take normal Actions (such as shooting at the fleeing opponent or pursuer, using a power, and so on). Alternatively, the character can Chase or Flee by making an Agility Test. The GM assigns the Difficulty based on the environment, with open areas being Easy (+30), while a densely packed marketplace would be Very Hard (–30). A success equals 1 Pursuit Point plus 1 Pursuit Point for each degree of success. A failure reduces the number of Pursuit Points by 1 and by another 1 point for a failure by two or more degrees. A failure by four or more degrees, reduces the Pursuit Points by 1d5. A character with negative Pursuit Points is effectively out of the chase or, for the fleeing character, pulled out of the chase. The first character to accumulate 10 Pursuit Points gets away or catches their prey, depending on who's doing the chasing or fleeing.

#### **Example**

*Karl runs away from a pair of drugged-up gangers who want his stylish boots. Karl's player rolls Initiative as normal (1d10+AB) and the GM rolls Initiative for the gang members (1d10+AB). Karl wins the Initiative, so he gains 1 Pursuit Point. On his Turn, he flees, so he Tests Agility. The GM rules that the streets are lightly congested, so the Test is Challenging (+0). Karl succeeds on the Test and gains a degree of success, netting him 2 more Pursuit Points for a total of 3. The gang members follow and Test Agility. The GM should Test them separately, which he does, with one succeeding and one failing, so one of the gang members falls behind. The other only succeeded, so he has just 1 Pursuit Point to Karl's 3. The chase continues over a number of Rounds until either Karl or the gang member achieves 10 Pursuit Points or until one breaks off the chase.*

#### **Slowing Pursuit**

If you're being chased, you can slow your pursuers by creating obstacles. There must be something to use—a crate of bottles, boxes, barrels, people and so on. Creating an obstacle reduces the number of Pursuit Points you would earn for a successful Agility Test in the Round by 1, however, you increase the Difficulty of your pursuers' Agility Tests by one-step.

#### **Distance**

While these pursuit rules are somewhat abstracted, actual distance is covered. For each Round of pursuit, the participants cover a number of metres equal to their Run movement.

terrain or through an area containing an obstacle, you may make an Acrobatics Test in place of an Agility Test to avoid falling Prone. You may also attempt an Acrobatics Test as a Free Action prior to moving at your normal rate through treacherous environments (but not environments made treacherous because of poor visibility).

#### **Tumbling Evasion**

When engaged with an opponent, you may Test Acrobatics to disengage as a Half Action instead of a Full Action. A successful Test allows you to move as if you had taken a Half Move Action without granting your opponent a free attack (see Fleeing in Dark Heresy on page 192). A failed Test means you still move, but your opponent gets a free attack with a +10 bonus.

#### **Awareness (Basic) Perception**

Easily one of the most important Skills to an investigator, as without this Skill, he is doomed to forever stumble into ambushes and traps, and to overlook vital clues.

#### **Eye for Detail**

Particularly perceptive Acolytes are trained to take in every aspect of a scene with just a quick scan, later recalling the subtlest of details that turn out to be critical to the investigation. Awareness cannot be used as an Investigation Skill in its own right, but it can be used to assist an Investigation Skill. When examining a crime scene, you may make an Awareness Test to attempt to notice any clues. Every degree of success reduces the Difficulty of a subsequent investigation Test by one-step.

#### **Example**

*Mattheus takes a quick look around the scene of a grisly ritual murder, but does not have time to carry out a lengthy investigation as his companions need him elsewhere. He makes an Awareness Test to notice any clues, getting two degrees of success. Later he comes to make an Inquiry Test, and recalls clues he spotted earlier, reducing the Difficulty of the Test by two-steps to Ordinary.* 

#### **GM Note: Using Awareness**

Given Awareness's importance to an Acolyte's mission, requiring characters lacking this Skill to Test at half their Perception may be too excessive, unduly penalising the player for a poor choice of Skills or slowing game play as the Acolytes fruitlessly scour the same area in search of that elusive clue. Rather than requiring all characters to Test Awareness, just have characters Test Perception. Those with the Awareness skill should face a lower Difficulty (usually two-steps) than those without.

#### **Barter (Basic) Fellowship**

Whether conducting menial chores in the marketplace before setting off on a mission, bribing guards to let you slip in the backdoor unnoticed, or negotiating for a choice piece of information, the Barter skill is always handy for minimising the impact to an Inquisitor's cred-stick.

#### **Bribery**

By first making a Barter Test, you can increase your chances of success with a subsequent Interaction Test by offering goods, services or cold, hard Thrones. A successful Barter Test and each degree of success beyond, grants you a +5 bonus on your next Interaction Test against your target made within a number of days equal to your Fellowship Bonus. The Difficulty of the Barter Test depends on the nature of the bribe as determined by the GM, who take in account the value of the bribe and the target's honesty and motivations.

#### **Blather (Advanced, Interaction) Fellowship**

Whilst unable to spin elaborate webs of lies as with Charm or Deceit, Blather is useful for baffling a guard long enough to escape, creating a distraction or stalling for time... or for coming up with a good excuse to feed your Inquisitor.

#### **Create Disturbance**

You may spew inane and nonsensical banter to create a distraction to divert attention from some other ally or event. If you have allies nearby who might benefit from the distraction—sneaking past a guard or picking their pocket, you may make a Blather Test to help them out. You make a Blather Test as normal and, if successful, use your Blather skill to assist your ally. Your opponent is dumbfounded as normal, although if your ally fails their own Test then the opponent may realise what is going on.

#### **Distract Opponent**

You can attempt to distract your opponent and conceal your hostile intentions. So long as you are not in combat and have not exhibited any hostile or overly confrontational actions towards your opponent, you may make a Blather Test opposed by your opponent's Willpower or Scrutiny. If you are successful you distract your opponent as though you had successfully feinted in combat, and so long as your next Action is a standard attack, it cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a standard attack then this advantage is lost. You may only use this function of Blather once per encounter.

#### **Carouse (Basic) Toughness**

Whilst excessive drinking is hardly encouraged by the Inquisition, only the most puritanical of Inquisitors would begrudge their Acolytes a drink or two. In addition to its primary use for relaxing, many an important clue or tip-off has been gained whilst carousing in a none too salubrious establishment, and only Acolytes who can hold their amasec stand any chance of remembering it come the morning.

#### **Drinking Contests**

A drinking contest, whether in the form of a competition to drink alcohol the fastest or to be the last man standing, is simply an Opposed Carouse Test. The consequences for failure are usually embarrassing rather than harmful, although this does depend on the drink consumed.

### <span id="page-226-0"></span>**More Than Human: Unnatural Characteristics, Test and Skills**

#### **Explained**

Certain creatures and antagonists have the Unnatural Characteristic trait representing a superhuman level of ability in one or more areas. Each Unnatural trait has a multiplier illustrating just how great the ability is (×2, ×3, etc.) which applies in the following ways:

The Characteristic Bonus is the first digit of their Characteristic score multiplied by the amount in brackets. For example: an Ogryn with Unnatural Strength (×2) and a Strength Characteristic of 43, would have a Strength Bonus of 8 (4×2=8).

Note that Unnatural Agility whilst increasing the AB, does not affect the creature's Move Rate—this is a separate Trait, Unnatural Speed (see Dark Heresy page 333).

When taking a Skill Test based upon a Characteristic with the Unnatural trait, the base Difficulty of the Test is staged downwards one level for degree of multiplier past normal (to maximum of +30), For example: the Archmagos Voltaic has a Dark Age of Technology cortical implant giving him Unnatural Intelligence (×3). He is called on to repair a damaged plasma core using his Intelligence based Tech Use skill. Normally this would be a Very Hard (–30) Test, but thanks to his Unnatural Intelligence the Difficulty is reduced by two stages to Difficult (–10), (–1 stage for ×2, and –1 for ×3).

During Opposed Characteristic Tests, where success is achieved, the Unnatural multiplier is added to the degrees of success. In the case of a tie, the participant without the Unnatural Characteristic trait loses the Opposed Test. For example: Garm Felbood is struggling with a tentacled monstrosity from the swamps of Dusk. Garm has Strength 40 and the thing from the swamp has Strength 33 (Unnatural (×2)). Garm rolls 20 (two degrees of success) and the thing rolls 30 (straight success), unfortunately the thing adds +2 degrees of success because of its (×2) modifier, bringing the Opposed Test to a draw. This translates to a victory to the swamp thing as it has Unnatural Strength and poor old Garm does not!

#### **Iron Stomach**

Acolytes who spend a great deal of time ingesting drugs and alcohol find that they develop a tolerance for a whole host of toxins. Whenever you knowingly consume something that is poisonous or toxic, you may make a Carouse Test in place of the Toughness Test. This use does not apply to poisons or toxins that have been injected, applied to weapons or delivered by any other non-oral methods.

#### **Charm (Basic, Interaction) Fellowship**

One of the more vital tools available to Acolytes in their pursuit of the witch and heretic, Charm allows you to instil feeling of kinship and companionability in those you meet. A successful Test can make friends out of foes, bank the fires of anger and get you into places where the bullet would otherwise fail.

#### **Compel**

You can convince a target to do something they otherwise might not do by laying it on thick with flattery or encouragement. You can compel the target, effectively improving his Disposition by two-steps instead of the normal one-step, by accepting a –20 penalty to your Charm Test. The target does as you ask, but afterwards he is entitled to an Intelligence Test to realise he has been used. If he succeeds, his Disposition worsens by three steps.

On a failed Charm Test to compel, the target's Disposition drops by one-step.

#### **First Impressions**

First impressions last, as the old Imperial adage goes, and it will do you well to keep this in mind as you make your way through the universe. When you first encounter a character, you may make a Charm Test to leave them with a positive impression, making subsequent Interaction Skill Tests onestep easier until you fail a Skill Test or commit some breach of etiquette or social blunder. Of course, if you fail this Test your attempt has the opposite effect, making Interaction Skill Tests one-step more difficult.

#### **Chem-Use (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

The life of an Acolyte is one fraught with peril, with hidden dangers everywhere as enemies of the Imperium do their best to survive under the oppressive weight of the Inquisition. Since many foes lack the firepower to mount significant opposition against the agents of the Inquisition, many resort to cowardly tactics in the forms of poisons, toxins and other vile substances to confuse, injure or kill their enemies. Chem-Use, then, can serve as the first line of defence against these vile weapons, while also giving the Acolyte the tools to concoct filthy brews of his own.

#### **Alien Toxins**

From the unholy cocktails imbued with the warp by Chaos cultists to the strange and lethal venom of the Tyranids, the galaxy brims with an appalling assortment of venoms and poisons, all of which are available if you know the right place to look. Normally, when you encounter a toxin, you may Test Chem-Use to identify it (see Detecting Poisons). If you fail this Test, you may still use the toxin, but the Difficulty worsens by two-steps.

#### **Concealing Poisons**

Whenever you want to introduce a toxin into a target's food, drink or air and want to conceal your activity, you may make a Difficult (–10) Chem-Use Test to administer the chemical in a way the victim may not detect. On a success, you apply the poison normally. However, for each degree of success, you worsen the Difficulty of the Chem-Use Test made later to identify the toxin from the victim's remains.

#### <span id="page-227-0"></span>**Detecting Poisons**

You may use Chem-Use when analysing the remains of a victim to detect toxins and chemicals buried in the flesh. Provided you have a toxinwand or a chymistry lab, a successful Chem-Use Test reveals the absence or presence of such a substance. Each degree of success reveals one more component of the substance, including such things as what it is, its method of delivery, and the most likely places where it can be procured.

If you lack proper equipment, you take a –20 penalty on your Chem-Use Test. Other factors can modify the Difficulty, including the quality of the remains, attempts to mask the substance chemically, or even the nature of the substance itself.

#### **Ciphers (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, Occult, Secret Society, Underworld and War Cant.

Ciphers is the ability to communicate in a specific code, a language developed by a group to conceal the contents of their conversations. Many Inquisitors develop their own Ciphers to communicate their instructions to their Acolytes, while also giving a vital tool for use between their servants while on missions. Whilst the Skill Groups for this Skill are quite broad, you can make them more specific, effectively creating sub-groups for each sub-skill. When using the Ciphers skill to discern or translate the meaning of the code of which you do not actually know, but is within a Skill Group for which you are trained, you may Test Ciphers normally, but at a –20 penalty.

#### **Countermeasures**

When a cipher is cracked by the enemy, it usually means bad news for those groups who rely on it, leading to misinformation and signs laid by the enemy that lead them into traps. If you suspect that your cipher has been cracked or that someone is using it to feed you bad information, you may make a Cipher Test opposed by your opponent's Cipher Test. Success indicates that you have worked out that something is wrong, giving you the opportunity to turn the tables on your opponent. Failure indicates that you are none the wiser to the subterfuge. The GM always rolls both sides of the Opposed Test in secret to avoid tipping you off that something is up.

#### **Deciphering <sup>a</sup> Cipher**

Once you have identified a cipher, the meaning remains hidden unless it can first be deciphered. The easiest way to decipher a cipher is to capture someone who already knows its meaning and then persuade them to reveal its secrets. Otherwise, the task becomes a lot harder, requiring days of painstaking code cracking and number crunching, and even then you may only be able to decipher this particular message and not crack the entire cipher. Cracking a cipher is an Investigation Test with a Hard benchmark, meaning that Tests to overcome it are at a –20 penalty. The process takes one month. You may use raw Intelligence, or your Logic or Scholastic Lore (Cryptology) as the Investigation Skill. Successfully interrogating or bribing someone who knows the code may reduce the benchmark of the investigation or negate the need for a roll at all.

#### **Climb (Basic, Movement) Strength**

Whether breaking into a cultist stronghold, clambering up scaffolding to find a good place for sniping at your enemies, or scrambling up a tree to escape from the snapping jaws of some alien beast, Climb is a useful Skill to have.

#### **Abseiling**

You may make a Climb Test in place of Strength when abseiling. See Chapter VII: Playing the Game in Dark Heresy for details.

#### **Helping Others Climb**

You may help novice climbers climb by setting up guide ropes for them, pointing out good hand holds or physically helping them up. You may assist another person with a Climb Test, even if they don't have the Skill themselves.

#### **Rappel**

You can descend more quickly when rappelling ropes are in place. When using ropes to rappel, you may Test Climb to safely descend at a speed of three times your normal Move Rate. A failed Test means you make no progress. A failed Test by one or more degrees means that you have become tangled up in the rope and must succeed on a Climb Test on the following Round to free yourself. A failed Test by three or more degrees means that a dreadful mishap has occurred and you fall, taking Damage as normal.

#### **Speed Climbing**

You may climb more quickly by taking an additional penalty on your Climb Test. By worsening the Test's Difficulty by –20, you can ascend or descend at your normal Move Rate instead of half your Move rate.

#### **Command (Basic) Fellowship**

As you rise in Ranks and esteem in the eyes of your Inquisitor, you ought to invest in Command so that when the day comes that you attain the Rank of Inquisitor yourself, you will be better able to lead your own Acolytes. Even before this distant and unlikely day of glory, Command has its uses, allowing you the ability to exert your influence over citizens, soldiers and more.

#### **Compel**

This expanded function works just like the Charm function except it applies to Command Tests. For details, see Charm.

#### **Devoted Followers**

Whenever you succeed on a Command Test to issue an order to an NPC who is Devoted or Fanatical (see Dispositions on page 230 in Dark Heresy) you grant a +5 bonus on a single Test related to that order for every degree of success attained. Multiple successful Tests are not cumulative and the benefits of a successful Test remain for a number of hours equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

#### **Instil Loyalty**

The greater the respect that your minions have for you, the greater your influence over them. You can improve the Disposition of your followers by making a Command Test while giving them a rousing speech, handing out medals or offering them encouragement. This Test takes a few minutes and a successful Test improves the target's Disposition by one-step. The improved Disposition remains until circumstances or your behaviour gives them cause to change.

#### **Common Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

<span id="page-228-0"></span>IX: Life as an Acolyte

**Skill Group:** Adeptus Arbites, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Creed, Imperial Guard, Imperium, Machine Cult, Tech, Underworld and War. Other Common Lores may be available at the GMs discretion.

Much as its name suggests, the Common Lore skill is possessed by every Acolyte in some capacity, representing the little snippets of local knowledge and information picked up when growing up in a place or inside an organisation. Such knowledge, whilst overshadowed by more scholarly Skills, should never be underestimated, as knowing just the right thing to say, place to hide or contact to meet can be the difference between success and failure, life and death.

#### **Famous Stratagems**

Whenever you would be called upon to make a Scholastic Lore (Tactica Imperialis) Test, you may instead make a Common Lore (Imperial Guard or War) Test, but at a –20 penalty, so long as the Test relates to famous battles or strategies.

#### **Local Knowledge**

For all a navigator's charts and maps, sometimes nothing beats local knowledge. You may make a Common Lore (Imperium, or other related lore) to see if you know anything useful about the local area. If successful you gain a +10 bonus to the next Navigation or Survival Test made in the same locale.

#### **Practices and Procedures**

A little knowledge about an organisation's practises and procedures goes a long way to smoothing things over when dealing with them. You may make a relevant Common Lore Test prior to dealing with members of an organisation. If successful, you gain a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests made when dealing with them.

#### **Red Tape**

Knowledge of the inside workings of the Administratum can give you the means to cut through endless layers of bureaucracy. When requesting information or assistance from the Administratum as part of an investigation, you may make a Common Lore (Administratum) or Scholastic Lore (Bureaucracy) Test. If successful, you may reduce the time taken by a further two hours for every degree of success. Alternatively, you can attempt to delay an attempt to get information by an enemy, increasing the time taken by two hours for every degree of success.

On a failed Test, you increase the time taken by two hours plus two hours for every degree of failure, or if delaying an enemy, decrease the time taken by two hours plus two hours for every degree of failure.

#### **Example**

*In the effort to track down a bit of elusive information, you research in the depths of an Administratum building, requesting data-slates on various suspects. As normal, you Test Scholastic Lore. Since the investigation counts as Drudging, it normally takes 24 hours. However, you succeeded on the Test, roll a 2 on your 1d10 and add your Intelligence Bonus of 5 for a total of 7. The investigation now takes 17 hours. But, you are in a bit of a hurry so try to cut through the red tape. You make a Common Lore (Administratum) Test and get two degrees of success. The investigation is further reduced by four hours, to 13 hours. Still a long night, but not as long now that the bureaucrats are on your side.*

#### **Concealment (Basic) Agility**

Sometimes there's no better option than to just hide from your enemies, whether it be from a rampaging Chaos Titan, a unit of corrupt Arbitraitors, or the guards of a townhouse that you have just violated. A successful Concealment Test may allow you to slip away, unseen and unnoticed, to continue your service to the God-Emperor.

#### **Camouflage**

Whenever you would attempt to conceal another character, you can Test Concealment and apply the results of your Test for that character. The effects of a successful Test remain only so long as that character has the benefit of cover, reduced visibility (fog, foliage, etc.), and does not move. If the concealed character moves, he is no longer concealed.

#### **Sniping**

Whenever you attack an enemy while successfully hidden, you automatically reveal your presence. You can attempt a Concealment Test as a Half Action to duck back under cover, but your opponents gain a +20 bonus to their Awareness Tests.

#### **Taking Time to Hide**

Normally a Concealment Test is a Half Action, representing you ducking behind cover or out of sight. However, if you take longer to conceal yourself, you have a better chance of remaining hidden. For every additional five minutes you take to hide yourself (or another), you gain a +10 bonus to the Concealment Test, to a maximum of +30 for taking 15 minutes to hide.

#### **Contortionist (Basic, Combat) Agility**

Don't underestimate the Contortionist skill. With it, you're not only harder to pin down, capture or generally tie up, but you can reach places others can't follow.

#### **Hiding in Odd Spaces**

You may make a Contortionist Test in place of a Concealment Test if you use the Skill to hide in an odd place, such as an air vent or oil drum.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Slippier than a Greased Kroot**

The contortionist's life is made all the more easier with the help of grease, helping him to slip out of hitherto impossible bonds. If you can first grease your body in some way, such as with oil, you gain a +10 bonus to all Contortionist Tests.

#### **Deceive (Basic, Interaction) Fellowship**

Unlike the quick-fire distraction of Blather, Deceit is far subtler and more useful in the long term. It can be used to convince an enemy that you are there to help, a guard that you really have just found the corpse in the room, or a merchant to invest his hard-earned Thrones into your "scheme".

#### **Acting**

When pretending to be someone other than who you are, such as when you use the Disguise skill, you may Test Deceive to enhance your disguise. A successful Test Opposed by your opponent's Scrutiny grants you a +10 bonus to all Disguise Tests made for a number of minutes equal to your Fellowship Bonus. You may only use this feature if you are communicating with someone and you must make a successful Deceive Test before Testing Disguise.

#### **Compel**

This expanded function works just like the Charm function except it applies to Deceive Tests. For details, see Charm.

#### **The Con**

The Deceive skill can be used to "con" a victim. When conning—that is, misleading him for any length of time for your own gain—you may make a Deceive Test in place of another Interaction Skill, such as Charm.

#### **Soothing Platitudes**

Not all lies are bad, and sometimes a tactful white lie here or there can smooth the way. You may make a Deceive Test to convince another character of some falsehood, whether in the form of a compliment or a plain deception. If you succeed on an Opposed Deceive Test against your opponent's Scrutiny Test, you gain a +10 bonus on Interaction Tests against that target for a number of minutes equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

#### **Demolition (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

Despite the constant drilling to be cautious and subtle by their masters, most Acolytes love to blow things up. The Demolition skill is useful for making sure it's not themselves.

#### **Booby-Traps**

A booby-trap is an explosive device intended as a trap. It is planted as a normal explosive, but typically with a proximity trigger designed to go off when a door or package is opened. An Awareness Test Opposed by the Demolition Test to plant the booby-trap may be made to notice it before it goes off.

#### **Detecting Explosives**

Normally an explosive device is located using the Awareness skill (to physically notice the device) or Security skill (to detect it using sensors). You may use the Demolition skill to find an explosive device (if you are using your own knowledge of planting explosives to find the most logical place where it could be placed). In all cases, the Test to detect the explosive is Opposed by the Demolition Test made to plant the explosive.

#### **Explosive Entry**

Sometimes, when there isn't enough time to bypass a lock manually or a doorway proves too much of an obstacle, only a well-placed explosive charge will do. If you have a small amount of explosive, either in the form of a shaped charge or a carefully placed grenade, you may make a Demolition Test instead of a Security Test to bypass a lock. Success indicates that the lock or door is destroyed, allowing access but probably alerting any guards. Failure indicates that the lock is destroyed but the door remains sealed, the explosives failed to detonate, or that the explosion emanates outwards instead of inwards, catching anyone nearby in the blast.

#### **Repurpose Explosive**

Whenever you successfully locate a bomb or some other explosive device, you can alter its trigger mechanism so that it detonates when you want it to rather than when the original demolitionist wanted. Resolve this as an Opposed Demolitions Test, with a success on your part allowing you to reset the bomb as if you had planted it, thereby allowing you to make all decisions about the explosive as normal. A failed Test indicates that you are unable to alter the explosive without first defusing it. A catastrophic failure by five or more degrees indicates that the bomb goes off.

#### **Disguise (Basic) Fellowship**

Whether pretending to be the servant of a corrupt noble, infiltrating a sinister cult or lying low in a vile dive, the Disguise skill is handy for helping you be someone you're not. Of course there is more to a good disguise than appearances, but this Skill goes a long way to giving you the best possible chance of remaining undetected.

#### **Disguise Voice**

You can use the Disguise skill to alter your voice so that you sound like someone else. If you simply want to change the tone of your voice in a way that you are unrecognisable, simply Test Disguise as normal. If you want to alter your voice so that it matches someone else, you must spend at least a week (minus your Intelligence Bonus in days) training your voice by listening to and replicating recordings of the specific voice. Impersonating a voice is always a Difficult (–10) Test or Hard (–20) if the person is particularly well known.

#### **Impersonation**

Generally, a Disguise Test allows you to pretend to be a nameless, faceless individual, someone that may fit with expectations for a particular location or area. Such anonymity is useful in getting into places where ordinarily you couldn't, but sometimes even a good disguise is not enough. Sometimes you must become someone else. You may use Disguise to impersonate another person. You must have prosthetics, a pict or holo-pict of the person's likeness, and other useful tools. Impersonating a specific person is always a Hard (–20) Test or Very Hard (–30) if the person is particularly famous.

#### **Look the Part**

With an appropriate disguise, you can make your lies easier to digest, such as disguising yourself as a messenger when trying to bluff your way past the guards on the front door. If you make a successful Disguise Test you may gain a +10 bonus to any related Deceive Tests, so long as the disguise makes the deceit all the more believable.

#### **Dodge (Basic, Combat) Agility**

Who doesn't like to be able to leap out of the way of lasfire or flying punches? Since Dodge enables you to avoid injury, negating attacks of just about any sort, it is a vital Skill for your survival.

#### **Dive for Cover**

Whenever you are allowed to make a Dodge Test to negate an attack, you may instead make a Difficult (–10) Dodge Test to dive behind cover. To use this feature, the cover must be within two metres of you. If the Test succeeds, you not only negate the attack, but also move behind the covering obstacle.

#### **Protect Ally**

You may also use Dodge to put yourself in the path of an attack made against an ally. Whenever you are adjacent to an ally and that ally is attacked, you may make a Difficult (–10) Dodge Test to swap your position with that of your ally. If the Test succeeds, you are attacked instead.

#### **Drive (Advanced, Operator) Agility**

**Skill Group:** Ground Vehicle, Hover Vehicle and Walker.

Only those Acolytes from the most technologically backward of worlds are incapable of driving a vehicle, but those with the skills to drive under pressure are altogether rarer. But the ability to shake off pursuers through traffic or give chase in a speeder through dangerously built-up streets comes in very handy indeed.

#### **Hiding in Traffic**

Sometimes, when you're being pursued in a vehicle, the easiest place to lose pursuers is to hide in plain sight—in traffic. So long as there are lots of other similar vehicles to hide amongst, you may make a Drive Test in place of a Concealment Test to Oppose your pursuers' Awareness Test to spot you, driving casually and blending in with the traffic.

#### **Forcing a Vehicle to a Halt**

If you are close to another vehicle that is the same size or smaller, and you are both going at the same speed, you may make an Opposed Drive Test to force the other vehicle to a halt. If you succeed, the other driver must brake to avoid hitting you, is forced off the road or brought to a halt by virtue of colliding with your own vehicle. This may inflict Damage on one or both vehicles, but either way the vehicle is stopped. If you fail, it is your vehicle that is brought to sudden halt, letting the other vehicle escape unhindered.

#### **Evaluate (Basic, Investigation) Intelligence**

Knowing the true worth of an item puts an Acolyte at an advantage when bartering for goods or services.

#### **Bartering**

If you first successfully Evaluate an item, every degree of success grants you a +10 bonus on a subsequent Barter Test made to acquire or sell that item.

#### **Forbidden Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Adeptus Mechanicus, Archeotech, The Black Library, Cults, Daemonology, Heresy, Inquisition, Mutants, Ordos, Psykers, Warp and Xenos.

For all an Inquisitor might try to school his Acolytes in treating Forbidden Lore with fear and caution, few listen and often find out more than they probably should. The wariest of Acolytes keep this knowledge safe for times of great need—the more foolhardy are likely to find themselves in trouble indeed.

#### **Forbidden Goods**

You may make a Forbidden Lore Test instead of an Evaluate Test, to calculate the (often priceless) value of a forbidden artefact or try to learn something about its history or purpose. Of course, peddling forbidden artefacts is often treated as a worse crime than simply possessing them, usually ending in execution... or worse.

#### **Forbidden Procedures**

A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing when dealing with forbidden lore, but can still ingratiate you with an organisation all the quicker. You may make a relevant Forbidden Lore Test prior to dealing with members of an organisation. If successful you gain a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests made when dealing with them.

#### **Gamble (Basic) Intelligence**

Whilst most Inquisitors would view playing cards as a waste of time, others concede it can be a great way to get in with the right circles, to say nothing of passing the time between missions.

#### **Baleful Consequences**

Sometimes being big or carrying a large stick can be useful for more than just getting people to do what you want sometimes you can convince them that there are far worse consequences than losing money if they don't let you win. Before making a Gamble Test, you may first make a Difficult (–10) Intimidation Test. On a success, you gain a +5 bonus on related Gamble Tests. On a failure, you take a –5 penalty on these Tests.

#### **Off Guard**

The wily Acolyte catches others off guard by lulling them into a false sense of security with an innocent hand of cards. You may make a Gamble Test to calm down tensions and ingratiate yourself with others. If successful, you gain a +10 bonus to your next interaction or Inquiry Test made with them, as they are likely to be more disposed towards you.

#### **Risk**

Life is a gamble, and your familiarity around the gaming table and understanding of the odds can aid you outside of a game of tiles. As a Full Action in combat, you may attempt a Hard (–20) Gamble Test. On a success, you gain a +10 bonus that can apply to any one Test made for the duration of the encounter. On a failure, you take a –10 penalty that applies to a single Test made during the encounter as determined by the GM. You may only use Risk once per encounter.

#### **Inquiry (Basic, Investigation) Fellowship**

As an agent of the Inquisition, your principle responsibility is investigation, seeking out the heretic and witch and bringing them to justice. Inquiry is a vital tool regardless of your career since it enables you to get a sense of the environment, learn clues and aid you in your ongoing search for enemies of the Imperium.

#### **Asking Around**

You may make an Inquiry Test to find out if anyone has been asking questions about you, your colleagues or anything else you might be on the hunt for. This is Opposed by the Inquiry Test of anyone asking such questions.

#### **False Rumours**

Just as you rely on rumours to find answers, so to can you plant false rumours to throw an enemy off your trail. You may make an Inquiry Test to plant such rumours for others to <span id="page-232-0"></span>discover. A successful Test increases the Difficulty of your opponent's Inquiry Test by one plus one-step for each degree of success.

#### **Lines of Inquiry**

You can use Inquiry as a very light form of interrogation, attempting to find information by asking seemingly innocent questions of the subject. In place of an Interrogation Test, you may instead make a Hard (–20) Inquiry Test. You are never at risk of inflicting Fatigue or Damage with this Test.

#### **Intimidate (Basic, Interaction) Strength**

Intimidation is neither big nor clever, but sometimes the ability to terrify an opponent into submission can come in useful for an Acolyte, getting far more done than with polite words alone.

#### **Carry a Big Gun**

You may back up your stern words with the threat of force, typically symbolised by a very large gun. So long as your weapon is bigger, or deals more Damage, than anything your opponent has, you gain a +10 bonus on your Intimidation Test.

#### **FEAR THE INQUISITION!**

You may make an Intimidation Test, coupled with liberal displays of authority and marks of office, to put the fear of the Inquisition into your opponent. On a successful Test you may add +10 to a subsequent Interrogation Test made against anyone who is at least familiar with the unpleasant rumours surrounding the Inquisition. Higher ranking members of the Inquisition, Daemon princes and Space Marine captains are less likely to be bothered by an Acolyte spouting such rhetoric, so the results of the Test are subject to the GMs discretion.

#### **Fearsome Glare**

Normally, using Intimidate is a Full Action, but sometimes you need to cow your opponent quickly to keep the target in place while attending to a more significant threat. You may Test Intimidate as a Half Action, but the Difficulty worsens by one-step. Furthermore, if you succeed, the effects of the Test last for just 1 Round.

#### **Scare Factor**

Whilst Intimidate normally requires you to be able to make yourself understood, you can attempt to scare or cow a group of people or creatures who do not speak your language (or any language) by the power of gesture and shouting alone. Using Intimidate in this way requires at least a Difficult (–10) Test.

#### **Obey My Command!**

You may abandon the tactfulness of command and resort to fear to ensure that your underlings obey. If you succeed on a Difficult (–10) Intimidate Test, you get a +5 bonus on all Command Tests against targets you intimidated for a number of minutes equal to your Strength Bonus. A failed Test indicates that you take a –5 penalty on such Tests.

#### **Invocation (Advanced) Willpower**

Whilst it is not always possible to take the time to properly focus a Psychic Power, most psykers would strongly urge a budding Acolyte to make the time. Psykers who might have advocated the opposite, urging a carefree approach, are rarely sane enough to offer such advice.

#### **Protective Invocation**

You may use Invocation to draw psychic wards and sigils about you, summon up your mental energies and fortify your will against attack. Doing so requires an Invocation Test, and if successful you gain a +10 bonus for every degree of success to the next Willpower Test made to resist a Psychic Power. A failure by three or more degrees indicates you have botched the wards in a significant way, imposing a –10 penalty to your next Test instead. For every degree of failure above three, the penalty worsens by an additional –10.

#### **Lip Reading (Advanced) Perception**

Although far less technical than a surveillance auspex, the Lip Reading skill is a relatively foolproof way of "listening" in to the conversations of others, useful for undercover Acolytes or those caught unprepared.

#### **Lip Speaking**

You may use your Lip Reading skill to communicate discretely with another person in your line of sight, either hiding coded messages in regular conversation or mouthing a message to them. You only need to make a Lip Reading Test to hide words in normal conversation, not to simply mouth a message, but the recipient must make a Lip Reading Test either way to successfully interpret the message. If either Test is failed then the message is not conveyed properly.

#### **Example**

*Mattheus and Ruthe are undercover at the Governor's ball. Mattheus is trying to mouth the words "get out, they've spotted you" to his colleague across the other side of the room. If he mouths the words to Ruthe, only Ruthe needs to make a Lip Reading Test. However, this might prove to be a bit obvious, so whilst in conversation with the Governor's wife, he may try to include the message in his conversation for Ruthe to see, in which case both Mattheus and Ruthe must make a Lip Reading Test. Both pass the Test and Ruthe gets out just in time!*

#### **Literacy (Advanced) Intelligence**

Literacy is another vital tool for those in service of the Inquisition, since any investigation that requires research into ancient texts, communication by discrete means or even reading instructions left by the Inquisitor, makes Literacy more than just a quaint option but a requirement for the job.

#### **Speed Reading**

Sometimes you might not have the luxury of time to spend an hour flicking through a tome to find the proper warding rituals. In such hurried cases, you may make a Difficult (–10) Literacy Test to skim through the text to find what you are looking for, allowing you to read a page of text in a Round. However, you are unable to get more than a sense of meaning or find a specific phrase or section by doing this.

#### **Logic (Basic) Intelligence**

Inquisitors value servants with the ability to crack mathematical formulae, codes and other puzzles, and those with extensive training in Logic can rise far, provided they keep their keen minds where they belong and do not dabble into the forbidden.

#### **Analysing Clues**

Late in an investigation, once the clues are all in place, you may use your Logic skill to try to put it all together and bring the investigation to a conclusion. You may use Logic as an Investigation Skill, making a Logic Test alongside another Investigation Skill Test. If both are successful, you may roll an additional 1d10 and subtract the roll from the amount of time taken to carry out the investigation.

#### **Code Cracking**

You may use Logic as an Investigation Skill when attempting to decipher a cipher. See the Cipher skill on [page](#page-227-0)  [227](#page-227-0) for more information on how to do this.

#### **Epiphany**

Once per game session, when you are stumped at an impasse or otherwise confronted with a problem you can't quite overcome, you may make a Very Hard (–30) Logic Test to conjure up an idea from the depths of your mind. On a success, the GM may grant you a hint, nudge you in the right direction or offer some other previously overlooked clue to aid you in your investigation.

#### **Mathemechanica Rituals**

Tech-priests know the mathemechanical formulae to coax a machine-spirit into behaving itself. You may make a Logic Test to recall the correct rituals and incantations, and, if successful, gain +10 to a Tech-Use Test made at the same time. Alternatively, you may use your Logic to assist another Acolyte's Tech-Use skill.

#### **Sooth Machine-Spirits**

You know the rites and rituals to placate an angry machine-spirit, coaxing it to cooperate. In the event of a weapon or equipment malfunction or Jamming, you may make a Difficult (–10) Logic Test to coax the machine-spirit into behaving itself. If the Test is successful, the weapon does not Jam or the piece of equipment does not malfunction.

#### **Medicae (Advanced) Intelligence**

Injury comes with the job of being an Acolyte and, for this reason, most teams include at least one member with some familiarity with Medicae, or at least have access to someone who does. Medicae enables you to patch up comrades, pull an ally from the brink of death, administer drugs and point out the best place to stick a needle to cause optimum pain.

#### **Diagnose**

You can diagnose what's wrong with a patient by succeeding on a Medicae Test. The GM rolls for you in secret. A success reveals the most basic trouble, with each degree of success revealing an additional useful fact. A failure reveals nothing, while a failure by three or more degrees results in a misdiagnosis with often spectacularly awful results if the physician is allowed to treat the patient. Examples include poisoning, lopping off the incorrect limb, replacing organs unnecessarily and so on.

#### **First Aid**

As described in Dark Heresy, First Aid is one of the most common uses of the Medicae skill in that it allows you to treat an injured companion quickly, by staunching his wounds and getting him back on his feet. The amount of Damage removed with a First Aid Test depends on the Injury Level of the patient as shown on the following table:

| Injury Level | Damage Removed     |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Light        | Intelligence Bonus |
| Heavy        | 1 point            |
| Critical     | 1 point            |

Generally, a Medicae Test to provide First Aid is Challenging (+0), but the severity as well as the type of injury can also have an effect. As an optional rule, you can use the following Difficulties for performing First Aid on injured characters. This method requires players to keep track of the type of Damage they've taken. As well, a Medicae Test is made to repair a specific set of injuries, each Test attending to a particular type of injuries. The Injury Level applies to total Damage taken, so even if the target only took 1 point of Energy Damage and 6 points of Explosive Damage, that same target would still count as Heavily Injured.

| —Difficulty by Type— |             |            |  |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|--|
| Injury Level         | Energy      | Explosive  |  |
| Light                | Challenging | Difficult  |  |
|                      | (+0)        | (–10)      |  |
| Heavy                | Difficult   | Hard (–20) |  |
|                      | (–10)       | (–10)      |  |
| Critical             | Difficult   | Very Hard  |  |
|                      | (–10)       | (–30)      |  |

| —Difficulty by Type— |             |             |  |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|--|
| Injury Level         | Impact      | Rending     |  |
| Light                | Ordinary    | Challenging |  |
|                      | (+10)       | (+0)        |  |
| Heavy                | Challenging | Difficult   |  |
|                      | (+0)        | (–10)       |  |
| Critical             | Difficult   | Hard        |  |
|                      | (–10)       | (–20)       |  |

#### **Example**

*When Julius takes a nasty hit from a laspistol and falls to the ground, a curl of smoke rising from the burn hole through his chest, Lucian rushes to his ally's side. Looking him over, he sees he's taken Critical Damage and can't take another hit. Since Julius has taken Critical Energy Damage, Lucian has to pass a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to remove 1 point of Damage. It's not much, but it might give his ally a chance to survive the firefight.* 

**Limits on First Aid:** If you're not using the optional rules described here, a character can benefit from First Aid just once per combat encounter, even when attended by multiple healers. If you're using the optional rules, a character can receive First Aid for each type of Damage taken. So a character who has taken only Explosive Damage can only receive First Aid once, while a character who has taken Energy and Explosive Damage could received two uses of First Aid, one for each set of injuries.

#### **Other Uses**

A person trained in Medicae can also attend to other injuries beyond Damage.

**Blood Loss:** A Difficult (–10) Medicae Test halts Blood Loss. If the subject is still fighting or has moved while suffering from Blood Loss, the Test is Very Hard (–30) instead.

**Broken Limbs:** A Difficult (–10) Medicae Test is required to safely remove a necrotised limb (which results from a failed Toughness Test made to resist limb loss from a broken limb). A failed Test deals 1d10 points of Damage to the limb location, ignoring Armour. Note that a failed Test also results in Blood Loss.

#### **Install Implants and Bionic Components**

The Medicae skill also allows you the ability to install replacement limbs and organs. To do so, you must have the implant or bionic device handy. The Test Difficulty depends on the unit, its quality and the facilities available. The process of implantation always takes 2d10 days minus one day per point of the patient's Toughness Bonus (to a minimum of one day). The following table describes the Test Difficulties for this procedure. All Difficulties are cumulative. If you have also have the Tech-Use skill, you gain a +10 bonus on Medicae Tests to install implants and bionic components. **Failed Tests**

| Table 9-2: Implants & Bionic Components    |                  |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Unit                                       | Difficulty       |
| Bionic Arm                                 | Challenging (+0) |
| Bionic Locomotion                          | Difficult (–10)  |
| Bionic Respiratory System                  | Hard (–20)       |
| Chem Gland†                                | Difficult (–10)  |
| Concealed Weapon Bionic                    | Challenging (+0) |
| Hermetic Infusion†                         | Very Hard (–30)  |
| Implant Systems                            |                  |
| Augur Array                                | Challenging (+0) |
| Ballistic Mechadendrite                    | Difficult (–10)  |
| Cortex Implant                             | Hard (–20)       |
| Cybernetic Senses                          | Difficult (–10)  |
| Manipulator Mechadendrite                  | Challenging (+0) |
| Medicae Mechadendrite                      | Difficult (–10)  |
| Mind Impulse Unit                          | Challenging (+0) |
| Optical Mechadendrite                      | Challenging (+0) |
| Utility Mechadendrite                      | Challenging (+0) |
| Injector Rig†                              | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Mining Helot Augmetics†                    | Routine (+20)    |
| Rite of Setesh†                            | Very Hard (–30)  |
| Vehicle Interface Circuitry†               | Ordinary (+10)   |
| †<br>Described in this sourcebook.         |                  |
| Quality                                    | Difficulty       |
| Poor                                       | Difficult (–10)  |
| Common                                     | Challenging (+0) |
| Good                                       | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Facility                                   | Difficulty       |
| Dreadful (in the field)                    | Hard (–20)       |
| Poor (field medicae tent, Rogue Trader)    | Difficult (–10)  |
| Common (hospital)                          | Challenging (+0) |
| Good (quality hospital)                    | Ordinary (+10)   |
| Excellent (Inquisitor's personal hospital) | Routine (+20)    |

#### **Example**

*Fenswick, an armsman, has lost his arm in a battle with a savage Ork and though he killed the wretched greenskin, he's in bad shape. Rushed to a field hospital, a surgeon works to install a bionic arm. The procedure is Challenging (+0) to start, however, the limb is good and thus improves the Difficulty by +10 to Ordinary (+10). Unfortunately, the facilities are poor, imposing a –10 penalty, bring the Test back down to Challenging (+0).*

A failed Medicae Test to install an implant or bionic unit can have nasty consequences. A simple failure reduces the quality of the unit by one-step. If the unit was poor to begin with, the unit doesn't work at all and could, in the case of a vital system, kill the patient. A failure by three or more degrees means that the limb breaks and the procedure seriously injures the patient, dealing 2d10 points of Rending Damage to the affected location (ignoring Armour Points). A failure by five or more degrees results in the death of the patient, the ruin of the device and 1d10 Insanity Points to all who witness the appalling mishap.

#### **Extended Care**

Extended care is covered in detail in Dark Heresy. However, if you are using the optional rules described under First Aid, the type of injury can affect the Medicae Test to treat patients. Use the predominant Damage type to determine the base Difficulty (e.g. the type of Damage that affects the target the most). In the case of two equal Damage types, use the worst modifier. Next, for each Damage type that afflicts the target beyond the first, reduce the Difficulty by one-step. This determines the base Difficulty of the Test. Unlike the system described in Dark Heresy, you must Test separately for each patient.

| Type      | Difficulty       |
|-----------|------------------|
| Energy    | Challenging (+0) |
| Explosive | Difficult (–10)  |
| Impact    | Challenging (+0) |
| Rending   | Difficult (–10)  |

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Example**

*Doctor Phelps attends four patients. His Intelligence Bonus is 3, so he takes a –10 penalty to his Medicae Tests to treat these patients from the start. Two patients have Energy Damage, so his Tests to provide extended care are at the base –10 penalty. One patient has Explosive Damage, so Doctor Phelps must succeed on a Hard (–20) Medicae Test to provide extended care to this poor soul. The worst-off patient took Energy, Impact and Rending Damage, the most of which was Rending. He's at –10 to start, –10 for Rending, and –20 for two additional Damage types for a total of –40. It doesn't look good for this soldier.*

#### **Pharmacy**

When administering a drug or treating a poison with Chem-Use, you may first make a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to bring to bear your Medicae knowledge. On a success, you gain a +5 bonus to the Chem-Use Test. On a failure by three or more degrees you take a –5 penalty instead.

#### **Navigation (Advanced) Intelligence**

#### **Skill Group:** Surface, Stellar

Whether using a simple map and archeocompass, an innate knowledge of the landscape or the stars themselves, an Acolyte with the Navigation skill is rarely lost.

#### **Throwing off Pursuers**

Knowledge of the landscape coupled with careful planning allows you to plot a route designed to lose any pursuers. You may make a Navigation Test to assist a Tracking or Concealment Test made to lose a pursuer.

#### **Tracking in Space**

By using stellar cartography, calculating ship velocity and headings, and analysing recent disturbances, you can attempt to track the movements of a spacecraft. You may make a Difficult (–10) Navigation (Stellar) Test to track a spacecraft in the same way you would use the Tracking skill to track a creature over land.

#### **Performer (Advanced) Fellowship**

**Skill Group:** Dancer, Musician, Singer and Storyteller. Others may be available with the GMs discretion.

As useful as the Performer skill is to entertaining fellow Acolytes on lengthy space voyages, it is perhaps more useful in distracting opponents or providing a useful cover story when undercover.

#### **Innuendo**

You may convey secret messages in your stories and songs. You may make a Difficult (–10) Performer (Singer or Storyteller) Test instead of a Cipher or Secret Tongue Test. The recipient of the message must have the correct Skill to comprehend the meaning as normal.

#### **Pilot (Advanced, Operator) Agility**

**Skill Group:** Civilian Craft, Military Craft and Spacecraft.

Whether snaking a lander through a hail of lasfire, or expertly piloting a guncutter in pursuit of a renegade ship, a skilled pilot is a vital component of nearly every Inquisitor's retinue.

#### **Shake Down**

A popular manoeuvre for when a ship has unwelcome intruders onboard is for the pilot to jolt or jar the craft in such a way as to force all unsecured passengers to lose their footing. If the defenders can be forewarned somehow, this can give them an advantage in a fight. You make a Pilot Test, opposed by an Agility Test by everyone caught unawares. If successful, the hapless victim is knocked over and must spend his next Round getting up again.

#### **Shadowing in a Vehicle**

You may make a Difficult (–10) Drive or Pilot Test instead of a Shadowing Test when following another creature or vehicle in your own vehicle. Success does not necessarily mean your vehicle goes unnoticed, but it does mean that it appears inconspicuous.

#### **Psyniscience (Advanced) Perception**

The Psyniscience skill is to psykers what Awareness is to mundane Acolytes. It allows them to detect nearby psychic disturbances and such forewarning allows them to avoid being surprised by a Daemon or psyker.

#### **Detailed Disruption**

Instead of merely detecting the number of locations or individuals causing a disruption in the immaterium, you may focus your senses to glean a little more information about them as follows. You may split your degrees of success between this chart and the chart on page 105 of Dark Heresy.

#### **Degrees Result of Success**

One The general strength of the phenomena (more or less powerful than you). Two or more The precise strength, nature and origin of the phenomena.

#### **Example**

*Herodi suspects that there is a psyker nearby, so he makes a Psyniscience Test to attempt to detect him. He gets two degrees of success, so could either detect the exact location of the psyker or the precise strength of the psyker. Or, he could split his degrees of success between the two charts, discerning the general location and the general strength of the psyker.*

#### **Diminish Psychic Attack**

Psyniscience allows you to perceive the intricate weaves of power involved in the manifestation of a Psychic Power. Whenever you are the target of a Psychic Power, you may make a Very Hard (–30) Psyniscience Test. If you succeed, you negate the effects of any of the power's Overbleed.

#### **Sense Lifeforms**

Every living creature leaves a psychic signature in the warp, and careful use of Psyniscience can allow you to detect the presence or absence of normal creatures. You may make a Difficult (–10) Psyniscience Test in place of an Awareness Test.

#### <span id="page-236-0"></span>**Scholastic Lore (Advanced, Investigation) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Archaic, Astromancy, Beasts, Bureaucracy, Chymistry, Cryptology, Heraldry, Imperial Creed, Judgement, Legend, Numerology, Occult, Philosophy and Tactica Imperialis.

Many Acolytes spend a great deal of their life studying and researching, becoming experts in their field, from psykers with their knowledge of the occult and the warp, arbitrators with their fanatical knowledge of Imperial justice, and officers with their understanding of the minutiae of the Tactica Imperialis. It is precisely for this expertise that Inquisitors surround themselves with such adept Acolytes.

#### **Practical Knowledge**

Whilst Scholastic Lore mainly concerns the theoretical, quite often it is applicable to more practical pursuits. You may make a Scholastic Lore Test to gain a +10 bonus to a related Skill Test, or to assist another Acolyte using a related Skill. However, doing so greatly increases the time taken to carry out the Skill Test as no scholarly knowledge is recalled hurriedly. The related Skill Test increases in time from Rounds to minutes, minutes to hours and hours to days. If the time taken is already in days, then this is increased by a further 1d10 days.

| Scholastic Lore    | Related Skill     |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Astromancy         | Navigation        |
| Beasts             | Survival          |
|                    | & Wrangling       |
| Chymistry          | Chem-Use          |
| Cryptology         | Cipher            |
| Imperial Creed     | Invocation        |
| Judgement          | Intimidate        |
|                    | & Interrogate     |
| Numerology         | Barter, Evaluate, |
|                    | & Logic           |
| Occult             | Invocation        |
| Tactica Imperialis | Command           |
|                    |                   |

#### **Scrutiny (Basic) Perception**

Whilst some would argue that an Inquisitor's default frame of mind is to be suspicious, those Acolytes with the Scrutiny skill are better able to judge when a suspect genuinely warrants that suspicion.

#### **Empathy**

A successful Scrutiny Test allows you to discern a target's disposition. This Test is Opposed by the target's Deceive Test if he has something to hide.

#### **Lying**

You may use your knowledge of lying to help make your own lies all the more difficult to detect. If you first make a successful Scrutiny Test you gain a +10 bonus to a subsequent Deceive Test.

#### **Search (Basic) Perception**

Search is a useful Skill for Acolytes conducting investigations, helping turn up valuable clues or hidden evidence. Search differs from Awareness in that it involves a great deal of exploration, turning over items, opening doors and letting your instincts guide you as you toss a room.

#### **Lengthy Searches**

You may opt to take longer over a search, meticulously going over every square metre to find what you are looking for. For every additional five minutes you spend searching an area, you gain a +10 bonus on your Search Test (to a maximum of +30).

#### **Searching for Clues**

Search cannot be used as an Investigation Skill in its own right, but it can be used to assist an Investigation Skill. When investigating a crime scene, you may make a Search Test to attempt to notice any clues. Every degree of success reduces the Difficulty of a subsequent Investigation Test by one-step.

#### **Secret Tongue (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Gutter, Military and Tech. Other Secret Languages may be available at the GMs discretion.

Just as with a cipher, many Acolytes use of Secret Tongues to quickly and discretely convey messages between one another. An Inquisitorial team who all know the same tongue are able to speak freely during battle or in other open situations without fear of being overheard or understood.

#### **Ciphers**

Although much of the meaning of a secret tongue requires body language and verbal intonations, it can be conveyed as part of a crude cipher. You may make a Difficult (–10) Secret Tongue Test instead of a Cipher Test.

Alternatively, if you first make a Secret Tongue Test you gain +10 to a subsequent related Cipher Test, representing the multiple layers of meaning and code hidden within the message.

#### **Security (Advanced) Agility**

Many an Acolyte has saved himself the indignity of breaking down a door with judicious use of the Security skill. Security is used to bypass locks of all types and circumvent tough security systems to get into well-protected locations. You can also use Security to take control of security systems so they work for you instead of the original owner.

#### **Hiding from Sensors**

Sometimes it won't be a person looking for you, but a sensor, such as an auspex. Unless the sensor relies on physical input, the Concealment skill is of no use. Instead you may use the Security skill in place of Concealment, if you have the means to disrupt or deceive the sensor.

#### **Security Rigging**

You can make a Security Test to set up and install a security system. Each degree of success increases the difficulty of any Test made to breach it by one. A Security Test to setup a security device takes one hour.

#### **Security Surveillance**

When using handheld scanners or larger security monitors, you may use Security instead of Awareness.

# IX: Life as an Acolyte

#### **Shadowing (Advanced) Agility**

Whether stalking a dangerous heretic through a packed market or following a contact through the deserted streets of a spaceport, Shadowing is useful for avoiding getting spotted. Shadowing differs from Concealment in that the latter involves hunkering down and hiding in one place, while the former is all about skulking and sneaking, creeping along while staying out of sight from your prey.

Shadowing becomes far easier in certain environments. When threading through a dense crowd, or following along in a foggy night, you gain a bonus on your Test. Each factor that masks your presence confers a +10 bonus to a maximum of +30 for three factors. For example, you would get a +20 bonus when Shadowing a target at night through a crowded bazaar.

#### **Evade Pursuit**

Once you are aware that you're being followed, you can use Shadowing to evade pursuit. Make a Shadowing Test Opposed by your opponent's Awareness Test. If you beat your opponent a number of times equal to his Intelligence Bonus, you manage to slip away unseen.

#### **Silent Move (Basic) Agility**

The Inquisition carries out much of its work in the shadows, going about its investigations under the noses of the heretical and dangerous. An Acolyte who has the ability to move about unnoticed, entering suspects' houses without them realising, is a highly useful asset.

#### **Ambush**

You can attempt to sneak up on your opponent and ambush him. So long as you are not in combat and have not yet been noticed, you may make a Silent Move Test Opposed by your opponent's Awareness Test. If you are successful, you sneak up on your opponent as though you had successfully Feinted in combat, and so long as your next Action is a Standard Attack, it cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a Standard Attack then this advantage is lost.

#### **Sneak**

You can make yourself practically invisible when Shadowing an opponent. If you first succeed with a Silent Move Test, you gain a +10 bonus on your Shadowing Test.

#### **Sleight of Hand (Advanced) Agility**

Although derided as common street subterfuge, Sleight of Hand has many practical applications for the Acolyte, ranging from the ability to palm a small but useful object at a crime scene, to slipping your Inquisitorial rosette away when apprehended by heretics, or even pulling a pistol from a concealed holster unseen by your enemies.

#### **Distraction**

You may make a Sleight of Hand Test to dazzle audiences with tricks of the hand with cards, marbles, or whatever other prop you happen to have. Any allies nearby who can take advantage of the distraction may benefit from your successful Test as if you were assisting them.

#### **Speak Language (Advanced) Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** High Gothic, Hive Dialect, Low Gothic, Ship Dialect and Tribal Dialect. Other languages may be available at the GMs discretion.

Knowledge of a variety of languages can broaden your ability to deal with the indigenous peoples of the worlds you explore, allowing you to communicate easily without having to resort to pantomime.

#### **Understanding Similar Languages**

Even if you are not familiar with a particular language or dialect, you may make a Hard (–20) Speak Language Test to attempt to understand a sense of the meaning or intent. If you speak a related language or dialect (such as High Gothic to Low Gothic, Hive Dialect to Low Gothic, and so on) the Difficulty decreases to Difficult (–10).

#### **Crude Ciphers**

You can make a Speak Language Test to improvise a crude cipher, a sort of pidgin tongue intended to convey a coded message. If successful, you manage to make a message that makes sense and a Speak Language Test, or an Easy (+10) Logic or Scholastic Lore (Crypography) translates it.

#### **Survival (Advanced) Intelligence**

Whether lying in wait for Nurgle cultists in the foetid jungle of a death world or searching for shelter from a sandstorm on a desert planet, the Survival skill can be a lifesaver.

#### **Hunting**

You may use the Survival skill in place of Tracking when hunting for animals in the wild. The Difficulty, however, worsens by one-step. It may not be used in urban areas or to track human or alien prey.

#### **Snares**

You can use the Survival skill to construct simple snares and traps to catch animals and other prey. To set the trap, you must succeed on Survival Test. The base Difficulty is Ordinary (+0), but you may increase the Difficulty in order to make it harder to disable or escape the snare.

A typical snare triggers by location, meaning that the target steps into the area and is affected by the trap. Snares affect just one target at a time and can be made large enough to ensnare a mansized creature. Once sprung, the trap must be manually reset to work again.

An intelligent creature may notice the trap before springing it by succeeding on an Awareness or Search Test. The Difficulty of this Test is Routine (+20), but if you also succeed on a Concealment Test, you can increase the Difficulty by one-step plus one-step for each degree of success. You may not retry the Concealment Test when constructing the snare.

If the target locates the snare, it can either go around it or attempt to neutralise it. In the case of the latter, the target must succeed on a Survival Test against the same Difficulty made to set the snare. On a success, the snare is dismantled.

Should the target spring the trap, it may make an Agility Test against the same Difficulty you faced to set the trap. On a success, the creature avoids the snare. On a failure, it is firmly caught and held until released. A caught creature can attempt a Contortionist Test once each hour to escape. Again, the Difficulty is the same as the one you beat to set the snare in the first place.

#### **Swim (Basic, Movement) Strength**

Opportunities for swimming in the 41st Millennium are often rare, but on occasion, this is a useful Skill to have, especially when exploring water worlds, tramping through sewers or escaping a wreck that landed in a large body of water.

#### **Aquatic Combat**

Whenever you fight while submerged in water, all Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests take a –20 penalty. As well, you must succeed on a Swim Test to move in this environment. When you Test your Swim skill, and you get two or more degrees of success, you reduce the Difficulty of your attack Tests to Difficult (–10).

#### **Hiding Underwater**

You can hide from a pursuer on land by diving into a body of water and waiting below the surface until they have passed by. If you do this you may use your Swim skill instead of Concealment.

#### **Life-Saving**

When another character gets into trouble in the water, you can dive in to help him out. If you reach the struggling character, you can pull him to safety by succeeding on a Swim Test, but the Difficulty worsens by one-step for the added bulk.

#### **Tech-Use (Advanced) Intelligence**

Gear and equipment in the 41st Millennium is tricky to use, the machinespirits unruly and restless. Tech-Use allows you to placate these entities and make them more cooperative when working with devices of all kinds.

#### **Cyber Wrangling**

You may use your Tech-Use instead of Wrangling, but only when dealing with machines designed to look and act like beasts, such as a cyber-mastiff.

#### **Technical Support**

When another character's Skill Test involves a piece of equipment, you may assist them using your Tech-Use skill, even if they are using a different Skill.

#### **Example**

*Mattheus struggles with the controls of the Inquisitor's guncutter during a rough landing and must make a Pilot Test. Ruthe does not have the Pilot skill so cannot normally assist, but because he is in the engine room placating the machine-spirit of the ship, he may assist using his Tech-Use skill instead.*

#### **Tracking (Advanced) Intelligence**

Tracking can be a handy skill to have in a wide variety of situations, whether chasing an escaped cultist through the sewers, working out the number of intruders at a crime scene, or hunting a wild beast in the wilderness.

#### **Escaping Pursuit**

Whilst the most straightforward way of concealing tracks from a pursuer is to hide them using the Concealment skill, as a skilled tracker, you have several more tricks up his sleeve, such as backtracking by using your own tracks or disguising your tracks to resemble those of an animal. You can make a Tracking Test to conceal your tracks instead of Concealment.

#### **Tracking Suspects**

You may use the Tracking skill as an Investigation Skill in situations where it is important to work out who or what has been present at a site, when they were there and how many were there, as well as working out where they went next.

#### **Trade (Advanced, Crafting) Various**

**Skill Group:** Agri (S), Apothecary (Int), Armourer (S), Artist (Ag), Cartographer (Ag), Cook (Int), Copyist (Int), Embalmer (Int), Mason (Ag), Merchant (Fel), Miner (S), Prospector (S), Scrimshawer (Ag), Smith (S), Soothsayer (Fel) Tanner (S), Technomat (Int), Valet (Fel) and Wright (Int). Others may be available at the GMs discretion.

Many Acolytes possess exceptional skills, either acquired before their service to the Inquisition or picked up during their employment. Of these, Trade skills are some of the most fascinating. If they possess the appropriate Skill, they can create unique gear and equipment, anything from a customised speeder to an illuminated manuscript, as well as countless other items far more interesting than a simple entry from the equipment lists. After all, would your players prefer to have infra-red goggles or enhanced "phaeton-pattern multi-goggles" that combine the abilities of the basic item plus that of a photo-visor? While the answer should be obvious, these items have a price in labour and cost, even to the trained tech-priest.

Trade Skills do far more than allow for simple Skill Tests; they represent the skill set necessary to modify or create things. If an Acolyte wants an armoured body glove, a longrange vox-caster or a two-handed shock mace, he needs the appropriate Trade Skill, or the Thrones to pay someone who does. Players use the Crafting rules found later in this chapter to create these kinds of items. Possession of these Skills also grants other advantages.

An Acolyte with Trade skills is considered a member of the Trading Class for purposes of determining monthly income (Table 124: Income and Social Class in Dark Heresy). This status may allow for interaction with citizens of a social status far beyond—or below—their means, along with the gratitude or ill-will that goes along with it! Cunning GMs can use these Skills as springboards for entire campaigns or as short, one-off adventures.

#### **Trade (Agri) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

While the odds of your Acolyte settling down to become an agriworker is not high, there may be instances where this Skill comes into play during the campaign, whether to start an ornamental garden in your quarters as a hobby or to cultivate a rare xenos flower essential to the treatment of an uncommon disease. This Skill can also be used for the identification and classification of unknown plants.

When using this Skill to grow a crop, be it medicinal, ornamental or foodstuff, the end Craftsmanship of the task determines the quality of the harvest.

**Poor:** The plant yields only half of the expected result, or the potency is only half that foreseen.

**Common:** The growth of the plants is average or as anticipated.

**Good:** Careful tending has produced plants with 150% of the results of a normal crop, either in quantity or influence.

**Best:** Attentive cultivation results in plants with twice the properties or yield of the standard variety.

#### **Trade (Apothecary) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

As a capable apothecary, you can do far more than just hand out anti-tox pills. You can develop new compounds from medicinal plants or chemicals and warn against the dangerous side effects of drug combinations. Your skills enable you to oversee the longterm reactions resultant from the most beneficial or destructive substances in the Imperium. You can recreate substances when provided a small sample and the proper equipment, and can determine new uses for existing substances by combining them in new ways. For example, you may be able to determine that combining spook and obscura in certain proportions actually creates a mind-warping hallucinogen—or a deadly poison.

While the Chem-Use skill covers the typical use and simple manufacture of toxins, poisons and drugs, the Trade (Apothecary) skill allows you to formulate more advanced compounds, identify particularly complex mixtures and anticipate the interaction between different medicines or toxins, particularly ones requiring substantial time to develop.

This Skill can also be used to recall the origin, derivation or manufacture of even complex or obscure substances, such as remembering that the primary ingredient of Slaught can be created from glands found in soldier-hornets. The result of the roll determines the amount of information revealed according to Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore.

Of course, you must first obtain all the necessary ingredients, components and equipment before attempting to create a compound. Acquiring the proper substances for specialised or restricted formulae may be quite difficult or illegal, or form the basis of an entire adventure.

The creation of complex compounds utilise the Crafting rules described on [page 245.](#page-245-0) Research into the nature or interaction of an unknown substance follows the Using Investigation Skills section on page 186 of Dark Heresy.

#### <span id="page-240-0"></span>**Trade (Armourer) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

The Trade (Armourer) skill is used to create, modify or repair arms and armour, from simple tasks such as adding a fire selector to a bolt pistol to the complex design of combi-weapons and artificer armour. This Skill deals with personal weapons and protection rather than vehicular or large-scale systems, which are covered by the Trade (Wright) skill.

One of the most commonly used Skills and potentially most useful in everyday application, Trade (Armourer) grants you unparalleled creativity in customising your kit. Keep in mind, however, that some technologies are simply beyond the capabilities of all but the most learned of the Adeptus Mechanicus. No Acolyte, however skilled, can create or repair weaponry from the Age of Technology. The GM should be the final judge in such matters.

You will still find a bewildering number of possibilities available for the alteration and upgrading of weapons and armour, from creating adamantine blades (without the Primitive attribute) to customising armour for its wearer (giving it Good Craftsmanship). Simple upgrades, such as those found in Chapter V: Armoury of Dark Heresy only require a simple Skill Test, but the creation of a more elaborate modification of armaments uses the Crafting rules. While by no means an exhaustive list, Table 9-4: Armourer Test Difficulty serves as a guideline for determining Crafting Difficulty.

In addition, you may use this Skill to identify the forge world, manufacturer, or possibly even the artisan who created the device, depending on the degrees of success on the Skill Test. If you have found a weapon used to murder a local Imperial official, it may be useful to know that it is Stygies VII-Pattern and engraved by the renowned master armourer Weland Tudela. Use Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore for identification.

# **Trade (Artist) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility (Intelligence)**

An artist can produce objects or experiences of profound beauty or emotion, inspiring the senses, mind and spirit. The Performer Skill Group covers the execution of many art forms dance, recital or storytelling—but Trade (Artist) deals with the creation of the material performed— the poem, play or song. The Skill also covers the composition of physical art: sculpture, paintings and hololiths.

Agility is the default characteristic for the Trade (artist) skill, but GMs may optionally allow the player to use Intelligence for the creation of more scholarly works, such as plays, music, poems and novels.

This Skill also gives the Acolyte the ability to observe works of art and potentially recall information about the school or style of the piece, and possibly even the name of the artist.

The Craftsmanship of a piece of art can make its performance easier or harder. A play or poem of Poor Craftsmanship would impose a –10 penalty to its performance. A song of Good Craftsmanship would impart a +10 bonus to the Test of the performer, and a tale of Best Craftsmanship grants a +20 bonus to its presentation. These bonuses also apply to the Charming Performance and Enthralling Performance rules.

**Inspirational Art:** Art can affect the mood of those observing it in many ways, including inspiration, sadness, anger and others. If the artist wants his work to affect the audience in a particular way, this should be defined in Step One: Defining the Task of the Crafting rules. The GM assigns a different Difficulty to creating a mural that inspires a positive reaction to the Adeptus Mechanicus than one without additional effects. Keep in mind, however, that these are moderate effects. While the viewer may feel inspired by the art, it will not cause him to change or act against firmly held beliefs.

The creation of an inspirational art piece is Hard (–20) for concepts coinciding with local culture, such as veneration of the Emperor within the Imperium, but is Very Hard (–30) for anything going against such conventions, such as fostering a more positive reaction to xenos when viewed in the Imperium.

## **Trade (Cartographer) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility**

You can produce maps and charts of high quality from information gathered first hand or by others. The Craftsmanship of these documents can affect the Navigation Tests of those using them. Likewise, you are able to read maps made by others more easily, obtaining hidden or obscure information left by other cartographers.

The cartographer must use observation or research to gain adequate information to create a map. The GM should keep this in mind when assigning the duration of a task, as large maps require lengthy examination and groundwork. The Heightened Senses (Vision) Talent can reduce the Difficulty of the task by one level if gathering data personally, so the Difficulty of creating a map of a labyrinthine Ecclesiarchy cathedral would be reduced from Difficult (–10) to Challenging (+0).

| Table 9-4: Armourer Test Difficulty               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

When creating maps from research, existing sources or second-hand information, the final Craftsmanship of the map can be no greater than that of the source material, no matter how good your rolls during the Crafting process.

#### **Trade (Cook) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

An Acolyte with this Skill can create meals not only pleasing to the palate, but also ones of desired nutritional content—or lack thereof. The results of this Skill can also be combined with Carouse, Chem-Use or Trade (Apothecary) in making drinks or medicines that taste better, or the creation of foods that mask certain flavours from those ingesting them. The GM should set the Difficulty of the task in accordance with the traits desired. Creating a simple but nutritious meal for fellow Acolytes might be Ordinary (+10); cooking a dish to mask a bland-tasting drug for a noble's entourage would be Difficult (–10); or devising a meal nutritious for a xenos creature could be Very Hard (–30).

Acolytes can also use this Skill to determine the ingredients or origins of foods they consume, or notice out of the ordinary tastes, using Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore. They can also make an Opposed Skill Test against the subject's Perception to either hide or reveal hidden substances within a dish or drink.

Meals or drinks of exceptional quality can affect Blather or Charm Tests. Refreshments of Poor Craftsmanship result in a penalty of –10 to these Tests, but a banquet of Good quality gives a +10 bonus and those of Best Craftsmanship grant a +20 bonus.

#### **Trade (Copyist) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

Copyists in the 41st Millennium are far more than mindless scribes scratching out data sheets with an electro-quill. Though certainly capable of this task, an Acolyte with the Copyist skill creates illuminated manuscripts of great beauty, containing anything from family histories to epic ballads.

In addition to penning words, copyists can create ink and other writing implements, including pigments that can only be read in certain types of light, ones that disappear after a specific period of time, or types capable of marking or etching pages of metal, ceramic or hide. Pigments of this variety allow for very advanced codes and provide a +10 bonus to Cipher Tests when using written materials. Each Trade (Copyist) Skill Mastery confers an additional bonus equal to the level of mastery.

Copyists can also create paper—as well as other writing mediums—and bindings. Pages can consist of sources as exotic as woven metal or alien animal hide, but could also be as simple as compressed plant fibre.

#### **Trade (Embalmer) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

An Acolyte with the Trade (Embalmer) skill can preserve the deceased, as well as almost any organic material, animal or plant, though some things require more elaborate treatments and chemicals than others. This Skill also allows you to reconstruct recently dead plants, animals or persons into a semblance of their unblemished living appearance. The process often requires chemicals and fluids with noxious odours, resulting in a somewhat negative public opinion of the trade.

In extreme cases, the reconstructive aspect of this Skill allows insight into the appearance of living things from even partial, damaged, decomposed or even skeletal remains. The Difficulty for the Test depends upon its condition. When used in this manner, utilise the Using Investigation Skills section on page 186 of Dark Heresy. The degrees of success determine the information deduced about the living creature or plant according to the following table:

| Degrees<br>of Success    | Information Gained                                               |  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Standard success         | Basic or unconfirmed<br>information concerning<br>the subject.   |  |
| One degree               | Complete<br>general<br>knowledge on the topic.                   |  |
| Two degrees              | Broad knowledge on<br>the matter, with some<br>specific details. |  |
| Three degrees<br>or more | Complete<br>detailed<br>information.                             |  |

#### **Trade (Mason) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility**

Masons erect structures, monuments, walls and fortifications out of stone blocks, mortar or cement. Depending on the desired result, materials may include cobblestone, granite, ouslite, marble or any of a number of materials. This Skill also covers the use of rockcrete, a common building material for Imperial structures and fortifications where speed of construction outweighs artistic concerns, and various reinforcements to stonework with iron or plasteel.

Given the scale of most masonry projects and the gross weight of the materials involved, most Acolytes will wish to use the Cooperation rules or at the very least some strong-backed servitors. With the hectic pace of Inquisitorial work, it's unlikely that circumstance will allow them time to personally fit each piece of stone for a project. Labour or servitors that simply move blocks of stone rather than practicing the skilled aspects of this trade do not count against the Cooperation rules.

#### **Trade (Merchant) (Advanced, Crafting, Interaction) Fellowship**

While the Barter skill covers immediate, short-term negotiations, the Trade (Merchant) skill represents the strategic manoeuvring and long-term dialogues necessary not only to close the deal but also to bring the other party to the table in the first place. Thus, you use Barter when haggling over the price of a data-slate, but use Trade (Merchant) when negotiating the rights to a stellar trade route between Landunder and the Lathes, or exclusive import rights to Hecuter firearms. These are discussions that may take months as opposed to minutes, and acts as a prolonged Interaction skill.

Various other Interaction Skills may have effects on the results of the negotiations: Blather, Charm, Deceive and Intimidate. The GM may have the characters roleplay specific meetings of the negotiations, for which he may grant a one-off bonus or penalty of +/–10 to the Test for that time interval as detailed in Step 4: Test Roles of the Crafting Rules. Alternately, he may allow the players to make an appropriate Interaction Skill Test for a similar modifier if they do not wish to roleplay the situation.

### **Trade (Miner) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

You are skilled in extracting stone, ore, gems or even promethium from the ground using a variety of methods, from drills and shovels to pumps and pipes. This Trade concentrates on removing the resource from the ground, as opposed to Trade (Prospector), which focuses on the detection or discovery of these valuable materials. Mineral wealth is not the only valuable commodity found under the ground; this Skill is also useful for the recovery of artefacts and antiquities when used with the proper care. You may also use this Skill to construct subsurface works suitable for eventual expansion into habitation or fortification. A mason or wright constructing an underground structure gains a +10 bonus on Crafting Tests if assisted by someone with the Trade (Miner) skill. Likewise, a miner gains a +10 bonus on Crafting Tests if assisted by someone with the Demolition skill, assuming they're digging for something neither fragile nor flammable!

Given the scale of most excavations, most miners have a workforce of some size to provide the brute force to move excavated dirt and stone out of the dig. These workers do not count as Cooperation, but simply allow for the miner to concentrate on technical aspects of the dig.

You gain a +10 bonus on Navigation (Surface) rolls when inside large or underground structures, such as the underhive or tunnels.

#### **Trade (Prospector) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

Acolytes with the Trade (Prospector) skill can survey an area to determine if it contains potentially valuable resources. Note that they will only be able to determine if those materials might be present and not their exact quantity, nor will they discover things far removed from the subject of their search.

When the Acolyte and GM look at Step One: Define the Task of the Crafting rules, they should carefully delineate the search, ensuring it is not too broad in scope. Thus, searching ten square kilometres for evidence of underground Promethium is perfectly acceptable, while prospecting "the plains" for "any valuable ores" would only be satisfactory if the Acolyte were armed with extensive testing apparatus and an army of assistants. Simply searching for "any resource" is right out.

However, because the search for one material may very well give evidence of another, additional degrees of success may provide additional discoveries. Keep in mind Acolytes receive this additional information regardless of the existence of the material for which they originally searched.

#### **Degrees Information Gained of Success**

Standard No additional information. Success

One If present at the location, Degree the Acolyte discovers evidence

of related resources, though not their exact nature. For example, a search for platinum ore would reveal the existence of another valuable ore in the area, but not its type.

Two The Acolyte finds one other Degrees material related to the search or incomplete information on one find only partially related to it. Thus, prospecting for industrial crystal formations might reveal evidence of emeralds or the possible existence of promethium pockets.

Three In addition to the results of or more the original search, the Acolyte Degrees discovers facts about another resource in the area. So, for example, while positively verifying that an area contains no water, the Acolyte also discovers sounding echoes from a system of oddly regular subterranean caverns.

#### **Trade (Scrimshawer) (Advanced, Crafting) Agility**

You have the ability to inscribe artwork and text onto ivory, bone and similar substances. Typically done with a needle and ink, much in the same way as a tattoo, hunters have often created artwork on the bones of their trophies. However, this ability has broader applications, allowing you to permanently mark many other materials utilising inks or acids suitable to each medium. It is rumoured that a few zealous Chapters of the mighty Space Marines practise this art upon their own living bones to memorialise fallen comrades.

At its most basic level, you use this Skill to determine if a material is suitable for scrimshaw, and to identify the proper "ink" for the process. Some only practise this art upon a hunting trophy, and some search for years to find a specific material for their work. As with the Trade (Apothecary) skill, the search for rare ivories or ingredients for inks can form entire adventures of their own.

This Skill interacts with a number of the other Crafting Skills: Trade (Apothecary) could assist in the creation of unique inks; Trade (Artist) might allow you to create a work of great beauty; Trade (Cartographer) may give assistance in engraving a map; Trade (Embalmer) can allow you to preserve your works from the ravages of time and decay. The GM should allow an appropriate bonus for creative Skill combinations.

#### **Trade (Smith) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

A character with the Trade (Smith) skill can shape or reshape metal, smelt alloys from ingots or ore, and forge all manners of weapons, tools and armour. Unlike some Trade skills, a smith requires a potentially extensive workshop, to include a heat source (forge), hammer block (anvil) and hammer, which may be powered by the smith's arm or a machine. While a metalsmith working in gold or platinum might have a closet-sized

workshop and miniature tools, the power hammers required for largescale projects—or harder metals such as adamantium—can weigh upwards of 100 tonnes. Forges can vary in size from that of a ration box to the legendary Titan-works on Mars.

Suitably equipped, and using more advanced alloys than iron or steel, an Acolyte can create armours and blades without the Primitive quality as a Difficult (–10) Crafting task.

Smiths often work alongside those with the Trade (Armourer) or Trade (Wright) skill to create special items or armour. For example, while a smith could certainly create a suit of feral plate armour, in conjunction with an armourer he might integrate less primitive elements. Likewise, alongside a wright, he can build structural components or armoured plate for vehicles or fortifications.

Acolytes with the Trade (Smith) skill can also recognise the work of other masters in the field, using Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore as a guide.

## **Trade (Soothsayer) (Advanced, Crafting) Fellowship**

It is important to distinguish the Trade (Soothsayer) skill, which gives the appearance of telling the future, from psykers using warp-powered divination. Certain "gifted" fortune tellers combine these Skills, but generally speaking, psychology and intuition power this Skill rather than the warp. Soothsayers are observant and perceptive individuals, adept at piecing together minute elements of information about an individual and spinning a tale of the future tailored to what their mark wants to hear. They use many of the same trappings as true psykers, including the Emperor's Tarot and fetishes, but these trapping are without any real power besides a keen intellect.

Trade (Soothsayer) works much in the same way as the Charm skill, influencing future actions of the individual whose fortune is being told. However, it acts over longer periods of time and allows for changes in the subject's planned actions in addition to their opinions.

A successful Skill Test convinces the subject of the authenticity of the soothsayer's skills. After this, the player and GM should discuss the time frame and desired outcome of the fortunetelling sessions using the Crafting rules on [page 245.](#page-245-0)

#### **Trade (Tanner) (Advanced, Crafting) Strength**

An Acolyte with the Trade (Tanner) skill treats animal hides to create supple, durable leathers used for clothing, armour or equipment. From semi-rigid armour cured from carnodon hide to soft and durable boots stitched from b'llek skin to a cape made from a crotalid pelt, tanners can fabricate all manner of equipment with their trade. Use of this Skill also encompasses the long-term care of leathers to prevent decay, cracking and other adverse effects of age.

Different animal hides necessitate different tanning methods, in both method and duration of the process. Generally, the more thick, tough or durable the skin, the more steps are necessary for treatment. Tanners require suitable chemicals for each step of the process, which due to their noxious smell often banish the trade to

the outskirts—or underhive—of many cities. This may make them unpopular with their fellow Acolytes if operating out of cramped quarters.

You can also use this Skill to determine the animal from which a particular leather was manufactured, using Table 9-3: Trade Skills Lore.

#### **Trade (Technomat) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

The Trade (Technomat) skill differs from most of the other Trade Skills in that it represents the care and maintenance of items rather than their creation. However, as the mysteries of creation for many items from the Golden Age of Technology have been forever lost, this Skill has great value throughout the Imperium.

Because of this technological regression, technomats may have no actual knowledge of why their maintenance rituals are effective, but simply know that they are. The application of holy oils and unguents, ritual sequences involving chants and prayers, or contact with certain runes on these sacred devices has placated their machine-spirits and kept them functional for generations. Knowledge of these rites is all that is required, not understanding of their underlying purpose.

The Skill may also be used to create effective rituals for newly discovered items, based upon the vast knowledge of customs for similar devices. Thus, if the Acolytes discover an ancient cogitator, their technomat might attempt to placate its machine-spirit with rituals known for similar machines.

#### **Trade (Valet) (Advanced, Crafting) Fellowship**

You have the ability to shrewdly provide for the needs of another for a range of requirements, including administrative and personal needs, and can even supervise a staff administering to these needs on a larger scale. Individuals with this Skill often use the title "major domo" or "chief of staff ".

At the most trivial level, this Skill addresses immediate concerns, such as selection of appropriate apparel for a meeting with an Imperial Governor or picking a suitable refreshment for a Clan Lord of Tallarn. Successful use of this Skill grants a +10 bonus on a single Interaction Skill Test for either the valet or host, representing the favourable impression generated by these thoughtful touches.

It may not be immediately apparent how to reconcile this Skill with the Crafting rules, but there are a number of Extended Tests that qualify:

• Maintaining a schedule of appointments and duties for a lengthy period of time.

• Assembling a proper wardrobe for a specific culture or Imperial region.

• Making arrangements for a large conclave of Inquisitorial representatives.

For these long-term Tests, the resultant Craftsmanship may impart certain bonuses at the GMs discretion.

#### **Trade (Wright) (Advanced, Crafting) Intelligence**

Acolytes use the Trade (Wright) skill for large-scale design and construction Tests. Buildings, bridges, monuments, vehicles and even void-capable starcraft fall under this broad expertise. While this Skill grants you the ability to design structures and vehicular systems, an Acolyte will rarely have all the tools and equipment necessary to realise his designs without significant outside assistance. It's all well and good to design a 200 metre marble arch celebrating the victory of Imperial forces over the Overfiend of Octarius, but quite another to actually build it!

Acolytes use the Crafting rules to formulate their design, determining appropriate modifiers for scale and complexity. After completion of the design, the construction is a separate Crafting task, using the appropriate Trade Skills, such as Trade (Mason) for a bunker or Trade (Smith) for armour plating on a battle bike. Wrights must usually enlist the help of others to realise their plans. Many masons, smiths and artists must all join skills to raise your Imperial victory arch.

For large or complex jobs, you may wish to utilise the Cooperation rules or split a job into smaller sub-tasks using the Dividing Tasks section to reduce the overall time necessary for completion. It might take one Wright a decade to design an entire hive city hab-unit, but he might complete the plans for the superstructure in a fraction of that time while others focus on different portions of the project.

You may also use the Trade (Wright) skill to gain information about the constructs or fabrications of others, such as the STC design upon which a speeder was based or the school of design for a bridge. Use Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore as a guide to determine the information gained.

#### **Wrangling (Advanced) Intelligence**

Despite the technological advancements of the Imperium, many worlds still rely on beasts of burden to carry them about. An Acolyte who is as comfortable on a horse as he is on a bike will rarely be left without a mode of transport.

#### **Riding Animals**

Any animal that's been trained can be ridden without having to Test Wrangling. You simply climb onto the mount (a Half Action) and ride off into the "setting suns".

Should the animal be unfriendly (i.e. it has not been trained), odds are that if you manage to get into the saddle, you won't stay there for long. To calm such an animal so you can ride it, you must make a Wrangling Test with a Difficulty depending on the beast's Disposition (set by the GM and accounting for your appearance, the animal's mood and the circumstances of the encounter). On a successful Test, you may climb up and ride. On a failure, the beast objects and tries to throw you off, requiring a Difficult (–10) Agility Test. If you pass, you may attempt another Wrangling Test, otherwise you are thrown off (flying 1d5 metres in a random direction). To gain control over an uncontrolled beast, you must succeed on a number of Wrangling Tests equal to the mount's Willpower Bonus. If you fail any of the Tests by four or more degrees, the beast is untameable and will never allow you to ride it; you'll have to find another means of transport!

*"Your skills are a gift of the Omnissiah. Create nothing with your hands and mind that you do not believe to be useful, beautiful, or lethal."*

— Arch-Magos Morrius, Master Artificer.

There will come a time in every Acolyte's career when they will crave something unique, perhaps a compact bolter with devotional inlays of gold, or maybe a cloak cut from the hide of a vanquished beast. They might even wish to erect a shrine to honour a comrade fallen in the name of the Emperor. Acolytes with the proper Skills can design and create these things, and many more besides, with the appropriate Skills and tools. T Using Crafting Rules

Skills with the Crafting descriptor are resolved in a different way than most other Skills. You may not know the results of your efforts with only one throw of the dice, and possibly not for extended periods of game time. These are Extended Tests that accumulate results over the course of many Skill Tests, and may take days, weeks or months to complete rather than several Rounds.

# **Using Crafting Skills**

The creation of new items can be long, exhausting work. An agri-worker or sculptor alike may toil for months before their efforts come to fruition. Just the design of particularly complex items may take months, to say nothing of their construction. Yet in the end, a patient artisan may be rewarded with a unique item whose appearance, attributes or abilities far exceed those of lesser craftsmanship.

Similarly, you may wish to improve upon an item already in your possession, either by upgrading its functionality or improving its Craftsmanship.

The Acolyte begins the Crafting process by defining the item he wishes to create in defined game terms. The GM uses this information to assign a Difficulty, Duration and Cost to the task. Both the player and GM consider a variety of choices or circumstances that may adjust these assigned factors. Next, the Acolyte makes appropriate Skill Tests after completion of a certain duration of work, and make decisions about how to best use his successes. If all goes well, the Acolyte's labour will result in a prized item of first-rate workmanship.

#### **Step One: Define the Task**

There is an enormous difference between adding a fire selector to an autopistol and creating a custom powersword, or between cooking a quick meal for a group of hungry Acolytes and preparing a fine banquet worthy of Imperial nobles. You must very clearly define your goals in concrete game terms so the GM can accurately determine the Difficulty of creating the item. You should think about basic elements, such as the base item, additional or enhanced attributes and abilities, and even reduced performance in some cases. In addition, you should specify any statistics different from those of the base item: weight, special qualities, Armour Points, or anything else appropriate to the task.

It's the GMs responsibility to ensure that the player has adequately defined the task or item, including all game effects. Should either GM or player miss anything in this step, it is assumed to be the same as a basic item of Common Craftsmanship.

#### **Example**

*Gyth, a Guardsman with the Trade (Armourer) skill, has decided that she wants to integrate a Cameleoline coating into a set of Guard flak armour while her fellow Acolytes do research in a nearby Administratum archive. The flak armour uses all the standard statistics from the* Dark Heresy *core rulebook, and the coating will have exactly the same game effects as a cameleoline cloak. The GM agrees that this adequately defines the task in game terms and proceeds with the next step.*

#### **Step Two: Assign Difficulty, Duration and Cost**

Most citizens of the Imperium regard technology as mysterious and beyond the reach of any but the most devoted of the Cult Mechanicus. Craftsmen, however, bridge the gap between the mundane and mystical, allowing them to create items different or superior to the norm.

Even with these Skills, there are certain tasks that are simply impossible, such as creating a plasma gun out of primitive components or improving a power sword with crude tools. While it's easy for the GM to say "no" to a player's request, you may find that this eventually stifles their creativity. A better option might be to assign a very challenging Difficulty, Duration or Cost to the task, allowing them to try even if the odds of success are low. You should also consider what the item will do to the balance of your campaign. If you don't want your Acolytes running around brandishing power swords with plasma pistols built into the hilts, make this decision now instead of trying to take them away after the fact.

At the same time, work with the Acolyte to apply the "common sense factor" to the project. If the goal is to create a lightweight, assault version of a basic weapon, it doesn't really make sense to double the range, as carbines typically have shorter range than their full-sized counterparts. Increasing the Damage for a weapon would also tend to reduce the number of shots per clip to make room for the larger rounds.

The GM should assign an appropriate Difficulty, Duration, and Cost to the task or item the Acolyte defined in the previous step. Make sure to look at factors that differ from the base item, such as weight, size and performance.

#### **Difficulty**

The Difficulty in creating an object works the same way as the Difficulty in any other Test. Thus, wiring two power cells together to make a larger power supply would be much less difficult than tinkering with the innards of an auspex to extend its range. Table 9-4: Crafting Difficulties and some of the expanded Trade Skill descriptions give guidelines in assigning Difficulties to projects.

#### **Duration**

Along with a Difficulty, each task also has an associated Duration. Keep in mind that difficult tasks need not necessarily have long durations, and easy tasks may very well take a long time. A miner digging a trench to expose an underlying

#### Table 9–4: Crafting Difficulties

layer of rock in hard-packed soil is not terribly complex, but without help, it's likely to take quite some time.

Unlike Difficulty, where the GM assigns a flat modifier to the task, Duration represents a range of time, since the Acolyte can't anticipate all the difficulties—or lack of inspiration—he may encounter along the way. The Acolyte should roll 2d10 and consult Table 9-5: Crafting Durations:

Dividing Tasks: For tasks with Durations of months or years, dividing them into logical components may allow a number of tradesmen to focus on the portions most suited to their Skills. A wright may work on the control system of a speeder while a smith forges armoured plates for the hull. While this technique can save time for the overall duration of the project, it adds time to each portion. Each craftsman may accomplish their individual task well, but they may not integrate well into the final product.

The GM and Acolyte must work together to divide the job into reasonable sub-tasks, though the GM has final approval for this process. If the Acolytes were looking to improve the performance of their groundcar, they might

| Duration | Time Range       | Time Interval | Examples                                                        |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minutes  | 2d10 × 5 minutes | 5 minutes     | A quick sketch; cooking a meal.                                 |
| Hours    | 2d10 × 1 hour    | 1 hour        | Repairing a security system; repairing minor damage.            |
| Shifts   | 2d10 × 6 hours   | 6 hours       | Adding a fire selector to a weapon; designing a jacket.         |
| Days     | 2d10 × 1 day     | 1 day         | Creating a custom set of armour; repairing major damage.        |
| Weeks    | 2d10 × 1 week    | 1 week        | Complex improvements to a basic item; sculpting a small statue. |
| Months   | 2d10 × 1 month   | 1 month       | Duplicating an illuminated text; complex item designs.          |
| Years    | 2d10 × 1 year    | 1 year        | Erecting a structure; vehicle designs and improvements.         |

#### Table 9-5: Crafting Durations

agree with the GM that this could be divided into work on the engine and work on the frame and suspension. Once, divided, the GM assigns a new Duration and Difficulty for each sub-task.

After defining the sub-tasks, add an additional task for combining all the parts together. The Difficulty of this task is equal to that of the most difficult sub-task. For each subtask over two, increase the Difficulty by one level. Thus, if a Challenging (+0) task has been divided into four sub-tasks, the Difficulty of combining them would be Hard (–20). If this would increase the Difficulty beyond Very Hard (–30), then the craftsman must reduce the number of sub-tasks. The larger the number of individual contributors, the more difficult it will be to combine them in the end.

#### **Cost**

Determining the Cost of an item can be challenging, especially in cases where there are few examples of similar items, but you'll quickly develop a knack for it. In most cases, determining Cost falls into two broad categories: constructing an item out of raw materials or combining existing items into a hybrid. Penning a map or building a bunker are examples of the former, and constructing a boltgun combined with a hand flamer would fit into the second category.

For instances where the new item is a combination of existing ones, estimating Cost is relatively straightforward. Add the costs of the basic items, and then add a reasonable cost for the materials necessary to combine them from Table

| Table 9–6: Material Costs       |                                        |                                                                              |  |  |  |

9-6: Material Costs. Thus, if an Acolyte wanted to build an auspex display into his carapace helmet so it would read out on his visor, the GM can add the costs of the two items plus the cost of some complex components.

The Cost for building things from scratch can require more creativity, but needn't be intimidating. The key is to start from a known point and modify appropriately. Table 9-6: Material Costs is intended to be a starting point and guide rather than a painful exercise in maths. If your Acolytes are building a watchtower from steel beams, feel free to approximate the amount of steel required, arriving at a cost that makes sense rather than painstakingly researching structural design.

#### **Example**

*The GM looks at Gyth's project and reasons that since cameleoline technology is fairly advanced and few outside the Adeptus Mechanicus would have any knowledge of its workings, the Difficulty will be Hard (–20). Since it is a complex improvement, he assigns a Duration of weeks. The cost of Guard flak armour is 300 Thrones, and the cost of a cameleoline cloak is 500 Thrones. The GM rules that 200 Thrones worth of advanced components are needed to combine the two, for a total Cost of 1000 Thrones. Gyth pays the Cost of the materials and then rolls 2d10 for the Time Range. She gets a 5 and a 3, resulting in eight weeks of estimated work. Fortunately this is about the same amount of time that her c ompanions will be investigating the archives of Hive Tarsus.*

#### **Step Three: Make Adjustments**

A number of factors can affect the Difficulty, Duration, or Cost of a task, some of which may be imposed by circumstance and some of which are chosen by the Acolyte. These include adjusting the Duration to make tasks easier or shorter, the tools or workspace used and the quality of raw materials.

You may voluntarily adjust Duration by one-step up or down for a corresponding adjustment to the Difficulty. Thus, for each step up in Duration, the GM-assigned Difficulty goes down by one level. However, if you decide the task will take more time than you have, you can also do the opposite, decreasing the Duration by one-step and increasing the Difficulty by one level. Any adjustment of Duration below "minutes" has no effect, and any adjustment above "years" multiplies the Duration roll by 2. Any change in Difficulty below Easy (+30) has no effect, and any shift beyond Very Hard (–30) means that the task is beyond the Acolyte's current abilities.

If the Acolyte has access to tools, workspace or materials of Good or Best Craftsmanship, the Difficulty or Duration of a project can also be reduced. Items of Good Craftsmanship can reduce Difficulty by one-step. Items of Best Craftsmanship reduce the Difficulty and Duration by one-step. Use the highest Craftsmanship modifier only in the case of multiple items that would affect the task. Thus if a tech-priest had access to a forge world Mechanicus workshop of Best Craftsmanship and also raw materials of Good Craftsmanship, only the modifier for the workshop would apply.

#### **Example**

*Gyth is fortunate enough to have access to an Inquisitorial workshop with tools of Good Craftsmanship at Hive Sibellus, which reduces the Difficulty of her task to Difficult (–10). She also is using Good Craftsmanship flak armour, but since she has already applied a Craftsmanship bonus, it does not produce another shift. Though she could reduce the Difficulty to Challenging (+0) by extending the Duration to eight months, she decides that her fellow Acolytes will be finished with their investigation long before then.*

#### **Step Four: Tests**

You Test the appropriate Trade Skill at the end of the Time Interval indicated by Table 9-5: Crafting Durations. This assumes you spend a full six hours per day—or the entire Time Interval for shorter durations—working on the project. If you spend less than the requisite amount of time per day, that day does not count towards earning a Test. Success on the roll reduces the time to complete the job by one Time Interval, but degrees of success or a failure of three or more has additional effects.

For each degree of success, you may either reduce the time necessary to complete the project by an additional Time Interval or apply it towards improving the final Craftsmanship of the work.

Failures of three or more degrees indicate that a setback has occurred. This both adds one Time Interval to the remaining Duration and subtracts one from the accumulated degrees of success. Note successive failures can lead to a negative total for degrees of success.

#### **Improving Craftsmanship**

You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear, nor a Best Craftsmanship target pistol from a Poor Craftsmanship underhive auto snub. An item's Craftsmanship may only ever improve by rebuilding it. The GM should assign a Difficulty one-step higher than creation of the existing item, but a Duration of one-step lower, adding in additional material costs as appropriate. An existing item's Craftsmanship can only ever go up by one level, no matter how good the Test.

#### **Cooperation**

Craftsman can combine their efforts for particularly complex or long tasks, provided the GM feels such assistance is realistic. While a large number of miners could very well work together on a new tunnel, only one technomat could reasonably work at soothing the machine-spirit of a small cogitator.

These rules add to the Assistance rules on page 185 in Dark Heresy for purposes of Crafting and Investigation.

When several workers with the appropriate Trade Skill combine their efforts, one is designated as the primary craftsman and the others as subordinate craftsmen. When counting the results of a Test, the primary craftsman counts only success or failure, without taking degrees of success into account. Each subordinate's success then counts as a degree of success for purposes of Craftsmanship or reducing the time for completion. If any individual fails his Test by three or more degrees, all other rolls for that Time Interval are considered failures in addition to the normal setbacks! You will quickly find that too many subordinates slow progress considerably.

Note that brute labour, such as workers carrying raw materials or slag, do not count as Cooperation; only the skilled work of another tradesman uses this system.

#### **Setting Things Aside**

The Inquisition seldom allows its Acolytes much free time to pursue their own trades, so it's likely they may have to set their tasks aside while the needs of the Imperium occupies their time. So long as they don't set things aside for too long, it won't result in a setback. However, if you set aside a task for a period of time equal to the next higher Time Interval, then you suffer a setback as if you'd failed a Test by three or more degrees. The project suffers a second setback if put aside for a Time Interval two higher than the original. Additional setbacks occur at each higher Time Interval. So a task with a Duration of weeks would suffer the first setback after being put aside for one month, and a second setback after being ignored for one year. For Time Intervals of greater than one year, simply double the previous one.

#### **Example**

*Gyth spends at least six hours a day for one week in the Inquisitorial workshop while her fellow Acolytes work in the Administratum archive, earning a Test at the end of the week. She has Strength 42 and the Trade (Armourer) skill with no Skill Mastery. Gyth rolls a 21, achieving two degrees of success. Since she knows her time is short, she chooses to apply them to further reduce the time necessary to complete the armour, leaving five weeks of work to go!*

#### **Step Five: Complete the Task**

After rolling the final success, the work is complete. However, simply completing the task doesn't tell you the quality of the end result. The degrees of success accumulated throughout the task process have the capacity to yield a result of superior—or inferior—Craftsmanship. Tally the total degrees of success allocated to improving Craftsmanship, subtract the number of setbacks, and look up the result on Table 9-7: Determining Craftsmanship.

| Table 9-7: Determining Craftsmanship |                                                               |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

#### **Failure**

There may come a time for particularly difficult projects when it becomes clear that a substandard result, or even failure, is unavoidable. If you accumulate more than five negative degrees of success, the project has failed and all materials utilised in it are lost. You may also voluntarily abandon a project at any time during the Tests, yielding the same result.
