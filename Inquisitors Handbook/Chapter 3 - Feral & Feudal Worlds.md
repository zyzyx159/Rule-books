# Chapter III: Feral & Feudal Worlds 

*"Don't matter if it's stone or synth-steel, a knife in the guts hurts all the same."*

— Scivener Myras Dance.

The Calixis Sector is no different from the many other sectors making up the Imperium in that the planets man has claimed are unimaginably diverse. As well as its hive, agri and shrine worlds, Calixis has its fair share of primitive worlds. In fact, Iocanthos, home of the Ghostfire pollen harvests, is tithed as an agri-world, but its tribal culture and barbaric people mean it would have been graded as an insignificant feral world were it not for the Imperium's need for this rare commodity. T

The primitive worlds throughout the Calixis Sector, and the Imperium as a whole for that matter, fall in one of two broad categories. The first are the feral worlds, those planets whose societies are formed by indigenous tribes or nomads. Technology on these backwater worlds is pre black powder and in some regressed cases, pre ferrous or lithic. The peoples tend to be tough, hardy and durable, and those few who make it off their home world and survive the horrors of a far wider universe are thought to be good stock, be it for the Imperial Guard or even as a Space Marine should they be so blessed.

The second group includes the feudal worlds, also sometimes known as medieval worlds. These worlds are usually on the cusp of discovering black powder or are grappling with the mess this technological leap often creates. In many cases, societies are not much more advanced than those on feral worlds, having emerged from primitive tribal structures to become region-based kingdoms. The movement of people into ever-increasing settlements, villages and towns causes society to become stratified into noble classes and peasant classes, with the difference between the two sharply distinct. Some medieval worlds form specific warrior orders and religious sects.

Naturally the feral world/feudal world distinction is one of simplicity. There are a great many worlds that fall somewhere between the two, some having attained black powder but still trapped in primitive extended family units, or others possessing advanced societal structures without the benefit of technological developments. As well, there are also numerous feudal worlds that have continued to develop since first being catalogued and now have access to technologies of which the citizens of hive cities would be envious.

Weapons and equipment originating from these worlds are primitive and considered obsolete by the more worldly inhabitants of the Imperium, since even a las weapon on its lowest setting packs more punch than a bow. However, in the hands of an expert, such weaponry can prove just as deadly. Any hive scum can wield a laspistol inaccurately, but a practised marksman could shoot an arrow through the eye of his mark without even triggering an energy resistant refractor field. Technology in the 41st Millennium is notoriously unreliable and can let you down at the most inopportune time. More basic and primitive equipment may not have all the gadgets, but in the right hands, it may prove to be the thing that keeps you fighting—and keeps you alive.

### <span id="page-93-0"></span>Ranged Weapons

*"Reload and fire when I say! They may have glowing armour, lads, but we have our muskets and our powder—they don't stand a chance."*

— Chief Marksman Naid Forder.

Ranged weapons used on feral and feudal worlds are handcrafted items, assembled by talented bowyers or gunsmiths who learn their trade through apprenticeship to another master. Where black powder weapons are present, many are artfully constructed, incorporating animal motifs into their design or inscribed with prayers to the God-Emperor. These items are also always fashioned from materials found on these worlds, substituting unusual substances where wood and iron are scarce. R

#### **Iocanthos Blunderbuss**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

A common primitive form of the black powder weapon is the blunderbuss. Essentially a large metal tube equipped with a primitive firing mechanism, these weapons are favoured for their ease of use and the havoc that they cause more than the damage they deal. Blunderbusses are also worthy of note for their seemingly indestructible ability to fire anything placed into the barrel, and it is unsurprising to know that they are also called "scrappers" or "pelters" on some worlds, referring largely to their foraged ammunition.

A particular example, the Iocanthos blunderbuss has a notoriously short range but a very wide spray from its conelike bore. Anything unlucky enough to be standing in front of one when its fired is likely to badly lacerated with metal scrap, lead shot and burning embers.

#### **Composite Bow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

Composite bows are constructed from a variety of materials such as wood, sinew and horn fused together under pressure to give the bow a compact design without sacrificing power. Accurate and quick to use, composite bows require substantial craftsmanship to make and care to look after, but offer notable advantages over most primitive black powder weapons. Composite bows created on advanced worlds use the same principal as their forbears but are crafted from superior materials, enabling them to shoot custom arrows that would not necessarily fly from a bow of classical design.

#### **Deuce Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Primitive)

This twin-barrelled flintlock pistol is popular on many worlds where duelling is common, and it also serves as a useful hunting sidearm. Most models of the deuce pistol feature separate triggers, one for each barrel, thus allowing the wielder to fire twice before having to reload. Typically, they can both be pulled at once—whether the powder takes or not is another matter.

#### **Fedrid Razor Disk**

**Class:** Exotic (Fedrid Razor Disk)

The hunters of Fedrid employ an unusual thrown weapon on their expeditions, the razor disk. About the side of a standard dinner plate, the weapon features a sharpened edge all around its outer surface. Numerous holes, made at 45 degree angles, pierce the disk's surface so that when thrown the air passing through creates a low humming sound, allowing the hunter to follow the disc by sound as it disappears into the dense Fedrid undergrowth.

#### **Flick Bow**

**Class:** Pistol (Primitive)

A flick bow is a compact version of the hand bow and is a popular sidearm for coachmen, ladies of negotiable affection and criminal gangs on many medieval worlds, although the finest crafted examples are made by the artisans of Balecaster. Constructed so that its span folds inwards for easy concealment, a flick bow can be hidden in a boot, muffler or sleeve for use in unexpected and unpleasant situations.

Before firing this weapon, you must spend a Half Action to "lock" the bow.

#### **Heavy Crossbow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

The heavy crossbow or arbalest is a ranged weapon of considerable size and is capable of delivering bolts with astonishing force, easily able to punch through primitive armour. Heavy crossbows find use in the endless wars of feudal kings, whilst others are gaudy, hunting toys of the nobility. In either case, the hefty damage that these weapons inflict is not to be ignored.

#### **Javelin**

#### **Class:** Thrown (Primitive)

A form of light spear intended for throwing, used both for hunting and fighting. The javelin is a common sight on very primitive worlds that have devolved into savagery, such as Faldon Kise, and carried in clusters by the chariot-mounted warriors of Monrass.

#### **Longbow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

A longbow is a larger variant of the more traditional bow, designed to send projectiles through dense steel plates and against much more distant targets. A longbow is typically crafted from the heartwood of a tree and most measure two metres or more in length. The quality of the weapon is wholly dependant on where it originates. Even on more advanced worlds, longbows see use, although this may be more for sport and hunting than for actual combat. Bows manufactured on these worlds use modern materials like laminates and plexi-chromes.

#### **Siskan "Father Shot" Musket**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

Fanatical theologians dominate the feudal world of Sisk and recorded in the records of their colonial founding is the admonishment that Siskan defence is "built upon the bones of our forefathers". No weapon better lives up to the character of this world than does the gruesome, yet undeniably beautiful, Siskan musket.

Formed in the main from a human thighbone, traditionally from one of the wielder's ancestors, this exquisite firearm is a highly desirable object in many noble circles. Utilising an iron-capped tooth as its striking mechanism, the "Father Shot" is considered to be a reliable weapon with a reputation for lucky hits. In certain seedy areas of Sisk, down on their luck artificers are willing to create trophy muskets from bones brought to them by well-paying worlders. They seldom ask where the materials come from, as their patrons all too often have the steely glint of revenge in their eyes.

**Siskan "Father Shot" Musket**

# **Vibe Spear**

**Class:** Thrown (Primitive)

This nasty weapon, haling from Endrite, appears to be a simple spear of fresh-cut wood to the untrained eye. However, any scrutiny of the spearhead reveals tiny backwards-curving barbed thorns protruding from the fibrous point. Once the wielder sinks this weapon into the target, the barbs bite deep and the thorned head may break off in the wound, and any subsequent movement sees the barbs dig deeper into the flesh. The Endrites use vibe spears to bleed and wear down prey animals. Removing the barbed point from human flesh, without further harm, is a delicate business.

Any living creature injured by a vibe spear must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or also suffer 1 level of Fatigue. Successfully removing the spear requires a Challenging (+0) Medicae Test, with failure inflicting a further 1d5 Damage which does not get reduced by Toughness or Armour.

#### **Volonx Bone Bolas**

#### **Class:** Thrown (Primitive)

A bolas consists of two or three stone or metal weights joined

#### **Crowe, Leader of the Five Great Tribes Volonx**

A failed agri-world long ago regressed to a feral state and dominated by harsh, rolling steppe and windswept grasslands, Volonx has for centuries been the domain of nomadic tribes of scavengers. For generations these tribes have clashed and warred for water and salvage rights, but seldom for conquest. However, this has changed in recent times with the coming of Warlord Crowe.

Having risen to prominence in his native tribe, the young and charismatic warrior seized leadership by killing his predecessor in an honour duel and set about training his warriors into a disciplined fighting force of a kind unknown on Volonx. In only a few short years he has wielded his army to great effect, conquering and unifying five other major tribes under his banner, and in turn forcing his enemies into rival alliances or supplication to survive.

Some herald Crowe as a saviour, the "Sky-Emperor's" chosen, but others call him a butcher in league with evil spirits. Regardless, there is no mistaking his ambition. The Volonx grasslands are vast and whilst it will be many years before Crowe will be able to claim full dominion over the entire world, none doubt that he will try.

together by cords. When a thrown bolas strikes a target, the weights wind around the target's extremities, tangling them up and preventing the target from escaping or getting any closer! Bolas can be found on many feral worlds in the Imperium.

The Volonx version of this weapon works on a similar principal; the weights are made from bone and are embedded with Sand Shark teeth to make them deadlier than a traditional bolas. Some nomad tribes have also been known to coat the cords in a poison made from virulent skem plant stem. When it contacts the skin, it sends the unfortunate target into anaphylactic shock.

#### **Volonx Thunderclap**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Thunderclap)

The tribal warriors of Volonx are famed for their strange scavenged weapons. Perhaps the strangest (and most suicidal) employed by these innovative fighters is the thunderclap. A thrown weapon with a surprisingly good range, the thunderclap is a carved from a light piece of hollow wood with a 45 degree bend about a third of the way along its length. At each end, a fearsome piece of sharpened bone juts out, whilst the innards are packed with a primitive and volatile explosive that detonates when striking a hardened surface. When thrown, the weapon flies in a wide circular arc and returns to the thrower if it does not strike a target, who then may (if brave and nimble enough) catch it again without blowing themselves to pieces!

Catching a missed thunderclap is a Challenging (+0) Agility Test. Failing this Test by three or more degrees will result in an Explosive Mishap (see page 137 of Dark Heresy).

#### **Notable Feral and Feudal Worlds of the Calixis Sector**

#### **Acreage**

A world divided into innumerable feudal demesnes, where armoured nobles clash and the people suffer under an oppressive serfdom. Acreage was formerly ruled over by the High King of the Grand Realm of Ascandia, but is currently in the grip of long-running and bloody war of succession. The years of misrule and desolation are taking their toll, as the planet's level of technology is starting to backslide from its high medieval zenith—a matter not helped by the merciless extraction of its Imperial tithe regardless of local conditions.

#### **Coseflame**

A small, inhabited planetoid riven with deep chasms and gorges criss-crossing its surface, Coseflame is sometimes known as the "cracked world" due to its appearance from space. Nevertheless, Coseflame supports a burgeoning human population who have developed numerous "chasm-city" states, driven by steam power and black powder, that constantly bicker and fight one another. Many off-world traders and agents can be encountered in the numerous marketplaces, bartering sophisticated goods and weapons for the wondrous crystals and rare ores the planetoid is famed for.

#### **Endrite**

The savage feral populace of Endrite worships the ruined hulk of a crashed Imperial battlecruiser as their shrine to the God-Emperor. The Endrites are viewed as expendable by the sub-sector authorities and the planet's population is sizable enough to have supported the raising of several barbarous Imperial Guard regiments over the years. The world itself is provisionally marked for heavy industrial works and exploitation by the powers of nearby Baraspine.

#### **Fervious**

A truly marginalised world accessed only by turbulent warp routes, Fervious has long suffered in its isolation from the wider sector. Once a developed civilization with a sizable population, some say its masters offended the Cult Mechanicus who cursed them and turned their backs on Fervious, dooming it to suffer without the Omnissiah's blessings. Whatever the truth of this tale, the centuries have seen the world rapidly decay and turn inward, and now the bulk of what remains of its people live out a barbaric existence in one vast sprawling shanty city amid the ruins of better days. Fervious's regression has spawned a very violent culture that relies on ritual murder to gain wealth and status. It is a world where life is cheap, brutality commonplace and death cults and doomsday prophets are rife.

#### **Faldon Kise**

This primitive frontier world lies close the Halo Stars and its tiny population is descended from generations of voiders marooned for past crimes. Spread across three small settlements, clusted around a single automated watch station that marks the Imperium's outer boundary, the people of Kise have a well-deserved reputation as untrustworthy and devolved savages and mutation is rife among them.

#### **Monrass**

This lush and verdant backwater world features diverse landscapes, from snowy peninsulas to arid deserts unspoiled by industry or exploitation. Monrass is populated by burgeoning archaic empires that predate the Angevin Crusade and have only in recent centuries mastered iron-smelting and chariot combat. The planet's "governor" is an Administratum satrap, sitting in an high orbital tithing station, who interferes only to occasionally levy troops and foodstuffs for the Imperium's due, while the only other off-worlders known to the people are a handful of missionaries determined to bring the Emperor's light to the benighted natives.

### <span id="page-96-0"></span>Melee Weapons Me lee Weapons

*"You see this dagger, off-worlder? I made this dagger. I killed the beast whose teeth make up this blade. You come here with your pretty guns that make pretty flashes, but I earned my weapon… did you?"*

— Crowe, Leader of the Five Great Tribes.

L ike primitive ranged weapons, melee weapons are almost always fashioned from common materials native to the world of their manufacture. Typical materials include horn, stone or bone. However, iron, bronze and even copper may also serve as materials on more advanced worlds. L

#### **New Quality: Fast**

The size and speed of this weapon makes it hard to Parry. Opponents that would Parry an attack against a weapon with the Fast quality take a –20 penalty on their Weapon Skill Tests.

#### **Bastard Sword**

**Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The bastard sword, or hand-and-a-half, finds the most use among the Harrowguard, an elite core of Iocanthos warriors in the employ of Warlord Vervai Skull. So called because the blade falls between the more traditional longsword and the far larger two-handed sword, having a long blade and heavy weight prevents all but the best trained warriors from wielding it one-handed. To accommodate all users, these weapons feature a longer grip to provide flexibility, giving the wielder the option to use it one or two-handed.

#### **Bucklers**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Bucklers are small shields used to attain some degree of protection without sacrificing mobility. The buckler's small size makes it inadequate for protecting against primitive ranged weapons such as arrows or crossbow bolts. However, it is effective for deflecting blows from hand-to-hand weapons. Some bucklers have a large barbed spike or point mounted on the outside and so can also be used offensively.

On Acreage, buckler-style weapons have developed with small metal spikes protruding from the shield's edge, transforming a generally protective item into a deadly weapon. Acreage bucklers have identical stats to normal bucklers but may also be thrown with a range of 8-metres.

#### **Chain-Sticks, Fervious**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Chain-Sticks)

Chain-sticks are made from two batons, linked together by a length of tough sinew. Variations on this design, especially on other more advanced worlds, feature a tough chain and steel construction. On Fervious, the ends of the batons are coated with venom harvested from the deadly Fervious serpent. Consequently, a wielder must be skilled to avoid poisoning himself while trying to strike his enemy.

#### **Cutlass**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

This short and heavy bladed weapon is most popular with naval officers and crews, and can be found on feudal worlds throughout the Imperium. Designed for close-quarter fighting, it is a simple weapon, relying on the wielder's brute strength rather than finesse or skill. When found among officers in the Imperial Navy, cutlasses are enhanced with power fields and other technological improvements.

#### **Double Flail, Penolpass**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Double Flail)

The lithe, dancing warriors of Penolpass use a weapon known as a double flail as their primary weapon. The weapon has an unusual structure, consisting of two spiked heads attached to chains affixed on either end of a stout wooden shaft. Given the complexity of this weapon, using it effectively requires a great deal of skill. The true masters of the weapon those of the Penolpassian Blood Order—can make its use a deadly, though beautiful, dance. In rare cases, the weapon's shaft can split to produce two smaller flails.

**Double Flail, Penolpass**

# III: Feral & Feudal Worlds

#### **Lightning Chain, Acreage**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Lightning Chain)

Acreage is the birthplace of the lightning chain, though this strange weapon has now spread to other worlds. At a glance, it appears to be a length of spiked chain measuring about one to one and a half metres. Closer inspection reveals that the chain is fashioned from a unique alloy found only on Acreage. It somehow "stores" kinetic energy, which is released in the form of bluecoloured energy sparks when the chain moves with any kind of sharp, excessive force. When properly used in combat, victims of a lightning chain attack not only receive dreadful lacerations and broken bones, but also suffer burns from the writhing energy fields that "spark" when the chain is in motion.

So dangerous are these weapons that not even the wielders are safe from the arcing energy. To avoid burns on the hands, lightning chain users wear thick gloves made from the tough hides of grox-like animals found on Acreage. The durable leather provides some insulation from the energy generated by the chain's movements.

**Lightning Gauntlet**

#### **Lightning Gauntlets, Acreage**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Lightning Gauntlets)

Made from the same metal alloys as the Acreage lightning chain, the gauntlets are much rarer as they require far more skill to create. As the gauntlets cannot be swung as fast as the lightning chain, the kinetic effe ct is lessened. Still, being struck in the face by a lightning gauntlet is likely to do some serious damage or even kill the unfortunate on the end of the punch. A layer of the same hides used by lightning chain wielders can be found inside the gauntlets affording the same kind of protection.

#### **Long-Sabre, Fervious**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

The Fervious long-sabre is a long, curved sword requiring two hands to wield. It is sharper than many other swords since the metal of Fervious is a very stubborn and hard material, folded many times to create a razor-sharp edge. Only weapons with power fields or monofilament blades can hope to surpass a long-sabre's fine edge.

Long-sabres are wielded by nobles of Fervious, but can also be found among the many death cults of that world. Fervious's society is very bloodthirsty, founded on ritual murder as a means to gain status and wealth. Thus all nobles are usually armed with these weapons to ward off assassins and other would-be usurpers.

#### **Sepherin Mirror Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Made famous by the Royal Scourges of Sepheris Secundus, the mirror shield is an ornate rectangular device capable of covering about two-thirds of its wielder's body. Constructed from layers of metal and stained crystal—silicate glass, baring the colourful crests and armorials of the nobility, the refractive glass gives the shield a mirrored effect known to repel las weapon shots of low strength. As such, it is considered an exemplar of ennobled warfare and "affairs of honour" on a world were such advanced weapons are restricted to the elite retainers of the ruling barons.

If used as cover against ranged attacks, the shield is large enough to protect the arm it is carried in and one other location (usually the body) providing AP 8 (Primitive). Thanks to its special construction sepherin mirror shield retains its full AP value against las weapons.

#### **Moon Blades, Balecarne**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Moon blades are primarily used by the elite Crescent Brotherhood of the Balecarne tribe, who originate from the feral world of Munsk, located in the Josian Reach. Over time, the tribe has spawned sister-tribes on the neighbouring worlds in the system.

Moon blades are two crescent-shaped blades, each about 30 centimetres in length. The wielder holds a blade in each hand, gripping it in the centre—usually a piece of leather is wrapped around the middle of the blade to protect the wielder's hands. The points of the crescent point outwards, away from the wielder's body. Moon Blades are difficult to use, taking many years to fully master. Experts, especially members of the Crescent Brotherhood, can wield the blades with deadly force and may also use them as short-range throwing weapons.

#### **The Knights of the Star Sanctum**

Balecaster is a feudal planet located in the Markyn Marches of the Calixis Sector. It is currently at a pre-black powder level of technology. The planet has three continents, only two of which are inhabited. The central continent is dominated by a single kingdom, ruled by the ageing King Regent, Tileon. The Regent has governed for many years, well over his natural lifespan, which continues to cause much contention among the nobles, including Tileon's son (who has spent seventy years patiently waiting to take the throne). Rumours persist that the king has been using off-world technology to prolong his life, though this is strongly denied by those closest to him.

In spite of whispered plans of treason or rumours about the king's son mustering an army to take the throne by force, nothing has yet happened because of the Star Sanctum. The Knights of the Star Sanctum are an elite order of trident-armed warriors, decked in all-encasing bloodshine armour. They are the most powerful force on Balecaster and to go against the king would bring down the fury of the Star Sanctum.

The Star Sanctum's origins are murky at best and there are numerous explanations about how they came into existence, many of which are at odds with one another. By far the most popular story is that the knights were once a warrior cult comprised of the best warriors from amongst the primitive tribes that roamed the world's central continent. While it's not clear what brought these warriors together—the most contentious part of their legends—what is known is that they met in a hidden chamber far below the planet's surface, a place known as the Star Sanctum. There, the knights codified the purpose of their order and mastered the fighting arts of their preferred weapons. Their detractors claim that far more than just their fighting style originated from this legendary chamber, and all sorts of stories about human sacrifice, worship of unspeakable forces and perverted rituals abound. That the knights remain silent on their origins does little to refute these claims, though their fierce reputation is enough to keep their enemies from voicing their theories in a more public forum.

#### **Punch Dagger**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A punch dagger is a simple weapon consisting of a blade mounted onto the hand in a way similar to how brass knuckles are worn. While not as efficient as swords or larger weapons, a punch dagger is an invaluable aid when fighting in confined quarters and tight spaces, where more traditional weapons would prove to be a liability.

#### **Sabre**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A favoured weapon of cavalry troops and other mounted warriors, commonplace on worlds such as Iocanthos and Volonx, a sabre is a sword with a long, curved, singleedged blade. The weapon's excellent balance allows riders to keep a hand free to control their mounts, and its utility and effectiveness make it a very responsive weapon in skilled hands. Sabres persist in use in far more sophisticated climes and are popular with many Imperial Guard officers and hive nobles, often featuring mono edge blades and even power field generators to enhance their effectiveness.

#### **Scythe**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Although principally an agri-tool, scythes have a history of "double duty" as weapons. Generally, they are far from practical in this respect, being unwieldy and ineffective against all but the most inexperienced opponents. Instead, scythes find their most common use as props in rituals or to convey a specific image. For instance, Inquisitor Gard Justarcker of the Callixian Conclave is known to wield a scythe wreathed in red, crackling energy bands.

#### **Spetum**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A spetum is a pole-arm equipped with three single-edged prongs on the "business" end. Most commonly found on Balecaster, it serves as a ceremonial weapon by the Inner Guard of the Star Sanctum. Although the opportunity to use these weapons in combat is somewhat rare, the warriors who form the Inner Guard are highly trained in its use, having spent countless hours honing their technique to achieve complete mastery.

#### **Steam Drill**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

These bulky, temperamental devices are primitive mining rigs used on worlds such as Sepheris Secundus and Coseflame, where more sophisticated tools, like the breacher units favoured by the Mechanicus, would be impossible to maintain. Powered by a weighty, scolding hot, backpack steam-compressor that serves to turn a huge boring drill-bit, they are not intended as weapons, however, are capable of inflicting very serious damage should an unfortunate get in the way of the drill head.

Steam drills require a Strength Bonus of 4 or more to be used effectively as a weapon. Weaker characters suffer a –10 WS penalty for each point of Strength Bonus below 4. Such is the bulk of a Steam Drill that they impose a –10 to Agility while carried.

#### **Stiletto**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A long dagger equipped with a narrow blade, stilettos are designed for easy concealment and also for driving deep into the flesh to pierce vital organs. A stiletto is not designed for prolonged combats, but rather to give the wielder a chance to eliminate his foe quickly and quietly. Stilettos are found throughout feudal worlds, especially in places where heavy armour sees widespread use, since these weapons are capable of slipping between heavy plates to reach the tender flesh within.

#### **Tower Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A tower shield is an immense shield of wood or metal, used to provide a mobile barrier more than an active defence. Simple plated iron examples are a common sight in the canyons and narrow passageways of Coseflame, while the inlaid bronze and wood shields found on Monrass are considered works of art in their own right.

Tower shields can be used as cover rather than as body armour; a re-enforced wooden version provides 6 AP (Primitive) while a sturdier, solid metal one provides 8 AP (Primitive). They are bulky and very unwieldy items and impose a penalty of –2 to the Agility Bonus of their users.

# Armour Armour

<span id="page-100-0"></span>*"I don my armour. I take my trident. I'm bound by the secrets given to me. I honour my king. I am a warrior of the Star Sanctum. I draw upon the power of the star as I draw my sword."*

> — Ceremonial Litany of the Knights of the Star Sanctum.

Armours of feral worlds tend to be of natural materials including wood, hides and bone, while feudal worlds benefit from a deeper understanding of metallurgy and may incorporate tougher substances in their protective gear. Iron or steel are the standards, though some worlds may use bronze or even copper. A

#### **Banded Armour, Fervious**

The banded armour of Fervious is made from layers of tough, laminated strips of hide, bonded or sewn to cushioned leather. The armour has been developed to stop the razorsharp Fervious long-sabres. The banded armour is also highly effective against primitive ranged weapons, but struggles against more advanced technology. Normally, the suits are worn by warriors and nobles who constantly fear for their lives due to Fervious's callous culture—where murder is an accepted form of dispatching rivals.

#### **Bone Armour**

On many feral worlds the strongest material available is bone, and so it falls to this crude substance to provide some measure of protection. Bone armour is made from the skeletal remains of beasts. The design and shape is wholly dependant on the world it originated on and the type of animal bones used.

There are a few common themes, no matter where the armour was made; the skull is usually hollowed out and serves as the helmet, while ribcages and thick bone plates form the breastplate. Sometimes the armour is dressed in furs and hides, but, more often than not, the bone is on full display to give the wearer a fearsome appearance.

#### **Bracers**

Bracers are worn on the wrists and may be made from hide, leather or metal. They serve a dual purpose in offering a mild element of protection, turning the blade of a dagger or sword, as well as assisting archers to steady their wrist when drawing a bowstring.

Like many types of armour, bracers are often decorated, from finely carved and intricate designs, to being inlaid with precious stones and metals to show the owner's wealth. Like many primitive items, bracers have found their way into Imperial society, primarily as a fashion item but often as a way of disguising useful gadgets like refractor or field generators, or even hidden communications devices.

### **Heavy Plate Armour**

A certain metallurgy technological base is needed before allencasing plate armour can be developed. Such heavy armour affords greater protection and is known to be able to stand low-level las weapon blasts. However, plate armour is heavy and very uncomfortable to wear. Full sets of plate armour are considered to be of great value by certain collectors throughout the Imperium. On worlds capable of developing this armour, it tends to be worn only by nobles and the most elite of warriors.

#### **Scale Armou r, Mon rass**

The Scar Dragons are in danger of vanishing on Monrass since their scales are valued for the construction of a particularly durable form of armour. Despite their fearsome nature, men, eager to reap the rewards that the creatures' skin can bring, have hunted Scar Dragons to near extinction. Once killed, the hunters skin the dragon and drag off the carcass to be sold as meat (which is very tough but considered a delicacy on and off-world). The scales are turned into suits of armour. It is a highly skilled job that can only be performed by a member of the Scale Jakkers Guild. The manufacture of such armour takes many months, as each scale needs to be properly aligned and then bonded to the tough hide that forms the basis of the suit.

Once complete, a suite of scale armour is very valuable and offers the wearer significant protection against both primitive and advanced weapons. The scales seem to be especially resistant to weapons that agitate air molecules to create heat, such as melta weapons. Some, who have witnessed the effectiveness of the armour have spoken of establishing a captive dragon population off-world in order farm the creatures for their desirable skin.

In addition to the normal benefits conferred by wearing this armour, wearers gain a +10 bonus on Agility Tests made to avoid catching fire.

#### **Scrag Furs**

Formed from the hide of the ill-tempered and ill-smelling Scrag Bear, this armour is cheaper than other types of fur due to its distinctive stench. Somewhere between rancid ham and vomit, the wearer of scrag fur is not a popular fellow. A character wearing scrag furs takes a –10 penalty on all Fellowship Tests.

#### **Silkmail, A c reage**

Chainmail is a staple defence on many feudal worlds throughout the Imperium and some of the finest examples of chainmail in the Calixis sector is the work of the artisans of Acreage. Far finer and lighter than common mail and entirely more comfortable, silkmail (as it is known) is favoured by the nobility and highly prized by off-world collectors.

F eral and feudal gear tends to involve the sorts of items and equipment that help people to survive in the often hostile environments of their worlds. Including a selection of hunting and foraging equipment, as well as items that reflect the customs and beliefs of feral and feudal warriors, the gear here supplements the items found in Dark Heresy. F

#### **Braid Cloak, Fedrid**

The hunters of Fedrid rarely go tracking without wearing a braid cloak. The cloak is made from the tough hide of a large herbivorous creature, called the Ungorth, which has evolved a tough hide to repel the sharp claws of its predators. The braid cloak is worn by hunters to protect against similar attacks, as the predators that fall from the trees on Fedrid are not particularly choosy about what they attack. Hunters often incorporate vines, leaves and other vegetation for camouflage. Outside of the Fedrid jungles, the cloak's value is somewhat lessened.

A braid cloak grants a +10 bonus on Concealment Tests when worn in forest or jungle terrain. In addition, the cloak grants 1 Armour Point to the Body. The protection provided counts as Primitive.

#### **Caltrops, Fervious**

The caltrop is a small, four-pointed spike, left on the ground for intended targets to step upon. Fervious caltrops are often coated in the venom of the feared Fervious serpent. Should the target step on the caltrops, they face a prolonged and agonising death unless anti-venom is nearby.

Caltrops are sold in quantities enough to blanket a two metre by two metre area.

Anyone walking on Fervious caltrops without at least 1 Armour Point on their feet counts as being hit by a weapon with the Toxic special quality. In addition, those walking across caltrops must succeed on a Difficult (–10) Agility Test. A success halves movement, while a failed Test quarters movement. The reduced speed lasts until the victim receives medical treatment.

#### **Monrassan Capsican Trap**

Used on the feral world of Monrass to break up the masses of soldiers used in the battles between its rival empires, these primitive land mines are surprisingly effective devices. Simply made from fragile clay pots and filled with a mixture of spinethorns, lamp oil and spay-burner grubs (an indigenous insect filled with a pyretic acid), the mines are placed in a shallowdug hole and covered with a thin layer of earth. When stood upon, the pot breaks causing the victim to be gouged by the spine-thorns and rupturing the spay-burner's bloated bodies, causing severe and painful acid burns, and igniting their clothing with sticky, burning ichor. Feral regiments raised for the Imperial Guard from Monrass have taken this weapon with them, even going so far as to take breeding nests of burner grubs with them on campaign, much to their Munitorum quartermasters' dismay.

#### **The Beasts of Fedrid**

Fedrid's impenetrable jungles are home to many dangerous and exotic beasts that lure off-world hunters to risk life and limb on this death world. Those who dare descend through its humid atmosphere find a hostile planet seething in an eternal battle of predator and prey, where even the herbivores are aggressive, attacking with the slightest provocation. The dangers are legion, ranging from the tiny but insidious flesh boring rot worms, to lurking pit-biles hiding beneath the loam with snapping jaws like mantraps, to thorn-back reptiles the size of Imperial Guard battle tanks.

Of the varied predators haunting the emerald jungles, the "tree-jumpers" are the best known. Six-limbed mantids the size of an adult man, they have massive slicing claws on the end of each appendage and clusters of compound eyes that keep them appraised of approaching prey. They dwell in the high canopy, leaping from tree to tree, ceaselessly hunting for their next meal. When they spot a likely victim, they silently drop from above, claws splayed, to land on the back of the unfortunate creature. They bite and slash, shredding flesh and rapidly devouring their meals before the spilt blood attracts the attention of larger beasts. While most tree-jumpers are solitary, packs of these horrors are not unknown and entire expeditions have been slaughtered by these savage beasts, particularly if their breeding nests are disturbed by the unwary explorer.

Of all of the monstrous creatures great and small, none are so fabled or so prized as a trophy as the Sa'vak; or the "black death" as it is also known, perhaps the greatest horror of Fedrid. The undisputed masters of the jungle, they are massive creatures, growing up to tens of metres in length. Capable of standing dormant and utterly indistinguishable from dead or petrified tree-boughs until their prey draws close, then their fibrous carapace opens up to reveal dozens of saw-toothed tendrils, poisoned barbs and vast beaked jaws proven to be able to slice a carapace-armoured man in half. Phenomenally fast for its size and all but imposable to kill, the Sa'vak is Fedrid's most highly sought prize, but one that has lured innumerable would-be hunters to their death.

Perhaps the most dangerous of predators on Fedrid, ironically of course, are human. Whether the well-armed expeditions of the jaded Scintillan nobility or the dark-eyed feral natives who serve as their guides, when they pass beyond the high compound walls of their hunting lodges, the only thing that attracts mankind to Fedrid is the scent of the kill.

Anyone stepping on a Capsican Trap must make a Difficult (–10) Agility Test. Failure indicates that they have set it off, causing 1D10 E Damage to their legs. A second, Challenging (+0), Agility Test determines if the victim has also caught on fire.

#### **Feral Healer's Kit**

On feral worlds, healers rely upon herbs, poultices and other primitive methods to tend to their patients. A typical kit will contain the following: seep moss to staunch bleeding, stitchticks to close wounds, sleep bark to numb pain, splints and soft leather bandages, bone tweezers and flint knife, and a heavy cosh for untreatable cases.

#### **Feudal Healer's Kit**

On feudal worlds, there is usually a modicum of medical theory and surgical techniques, often taught by secretive guilds or academic schools. Occasionally there are folk practitioners using ancient wisdom and common sense, however, most of these are usually burnt as witches. A typical healer's kit would contains the following items: leeches to staunch bleeding, needle and thread to close wounds, alchemical tincture to numb pain, cloth bandages, splints and plaster, metal scalpel, probes, clamps and pliers, saw for amputations and a stout leather apron to stop the stains.

#### **Glo-slugs of Dusk**

In the foetid swamps of Dusk swim the glo-slugs, brown and black gastropods of an unremarkable nature. Like much of Dusk's native fauna, the slugs are carnivorous and spend their lives searching for dead creatures to slime over and digest. However, when removed from the water, the slug's skin emanates a phosphorous white glow. Placing two or more slugs together dramatically increases the illumination. The inhabitants of Dusk place three or four slugs together in a jar to give off a very bright light to help them illuminate the marshy hunting grounds.

Each slug illuminates a one metre radius area. The light from multiple glo-slugs is cumulative, so two will shed light out to two metre s, three to three metres, and so on.

This natural light source can prove useful in numerous situations where there is no power or where null-fields have been installed, preventing torches and other illuminating devices from working.

#### **Hunting Musk**

Tribal hunters are all too aware of the acute senses of their prey. Accordingly, many smear themselves with stench-laden pastes to disguise their natural body odour. Made from all manner of foulness (on which it is best not to dwell), nevertheless, such pastes are a useful tool. Creatures that rely on smell to detect their prey take a –20 penalty on Perception Tests made to detect characters wearing hunting musk. An application of hunting musk lasts for 1d10 hours.

#### **Kill Sticks, Volonx**

Volonx kill sticks are used in booby traps and consist of a sharpened stick made from bamboo or mono-plastics. They work best when employed in groups, often based within a hidden pit or trench. Anyone stepping into an area of kill sticks must succeed on an Agility Test or take 1d10+2 R points of Damage.

#### **Powder Bombs, Fervious**

Created by the death cults of Fervious, an ignited powder bomb unleashes a white powder throughout a 30-metre radius. The powder reduces visibility and the pollens used to make the powder are toxic to humans. Inhaling the powder is rarely lethal. However, it will inflame the eyes, nose and throat, and induces serious nausea, all of which takes a good few hours to clear.

The cloud of powder disperses at a rate appropriate to the environmental conditions. A strong wind clears the area in 1 Round. Indoors, the powder settles after 2d10 Rounds.

Powder bombs are Thrown weapons with a Range of 10m and have the Smoke quality. Those caught within the blast must Test Toughness or gain one level of Fatigue.

#### **Skeleton Keys**

On feudal worlds, the locks of many castles (and sometimes whole towns) have been designed so that one master key, known as the skeleton key, can open them. Given that most primitive locks operate on the same basic mechanism, those who wish easy ingress often keep a collection of such keys on hand.

#### **Skem Net, Volonx**

A skem net is made from strips of plant stem harvested from the poisonous skem plant. A typical net is usually six metres square. The stem of the skem plant is notoriously hardy and so the net can actually be packed up quite tight, to about the size of a man's balled fist. On Volonx, hunters launch the net with the aid of an arrow. The net is coated in skem poison that causes anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in it to be sent into anaphylactic shock unless the antidote is administered within ten minutes. This also means that the owner of the net must always use gloves and avoid skin contact when repacking it.

Use the Toxic and Snare rules when the net is deployed.

#### **Sleep Dust, Zillman's Domain**

Harvested on Zillman's Domain, the apothecaries found that crushing the seeds of an innocuous red and black flowered plant created a potent soporific powder. Inhaling the dust would drop a full-grown human in a matter of minutes and allow them to sleep dreamlessly for hours. Apart from feeling slightly drowsy for another couple hours afterwards, there are no other short- or long-term effects. The powder is tasteless and is often administered by being stirred into food.

Inhaling or ingesting sleep dust forces a character to make a Difficult (–10) Toughness Test or 1d10 minutes later fall into a deep sleep for 1d5–TB hours.

#### **Smoke Flares, Fedrid**

Fedrid smoke flares are made from the hollowed-out spines of a native cactus-like plant. The spines are filled with white cotton that, when lit, gives off a high yield of thick black, acrid smoke over an area of up to 40 metres. The smoke disperses at a rate appropriate to the environmental conditions. A strong wind clears the area in 1d5 Rounds; indoors, the smoke clears after 2d10 minutes.

#### **Sour Mud, Endrite**

The substance known as sour mud is found on the beds of dormant tar pits on the feral world Endrite. It is used by shamans and witch doctors for healing and can be used in poultices, placed directly onto a wound to staunch bleeding or even diluted with hot water and ingested to reduce fevers although it is said to taste foul!

Studies show the putty-like substance is rich in minerals and contains strong anti-bacterial agents. Rumours abound of an interested corporation wishing to build a large industrial complex on the tar pits to harvest and export the substance off-world.

A medic using sour mud gains a +10 bonus on Medicae Tests when treating diseases and fevers and may use the substance to stop Blood Loss as a Full Action.

#### **Spark Rocks**

Spark rocks are small white crystals that work like flint and steel. Striking the rocks together creates sparks. Creating the sparks over tinder, such as animal hair, wood shavings or dried dung, makes a flame that can be nursed into a campfire or used to light a torch. Spark rocks can even be used when wet.

It is best not to store the rocks together as even the slightest contract can produce sparks. Inexperienced users have been known to set their packs alight by keeping two or more spark rocks in the same bag.

#### **Spine Pick, Faldon Kise**

Spine picks are useful tools created from the tough spikes that protrude from the hide of the Gar-keeler, a giant porcupine-like creature that inhabits the jungles of the frontier world Faldon Kise in the Malfian sub-sector. Once the creature is slaughtered and its spines removed, the base of the spines are bevelled into a crude handle, leaving the sharp spike tip in place.

The pick can be used as a basic, improvised weapon. However, its primary role is that of a climbing aid. A spine pick grants a +10 bonus on all Climb Tests.

#### **Stink Bombs**

These are used on a variety of primitive worlds, although the most renowned are those from the planet of Munsk. Created by collecting the faeces of a large worm-like creature, the excrement is then mixed with virulent pollen from the yellowpetalled plant known locally as the "dung-bloom" for its distinctive odour. The mixture is then balled up and encased in a dried mud shell. Once the fragile mud-shell is cracked an intolerable stench is released (an eight metre diameter per bomb). Most humans will not be able to stand the odour and must vacate the area or experience severe nausea and even loss of consciousness if they suffer prolonged exposure.

Anyone exposed to a stink bomb must succeed on a Toughness Test each Round or gain one level of Fatigue.

#### **Syckle Oil, Tygress V**

Made from linn seeds found only on the feral world of Tygress V, syckle oil can be used on any metal blade. The oil coats the blade giving it a bright sheen and making the metal all but frictionless. It will also prevent rust and tarnishing. Weaponsmiths use the oil on simple mechanisms, such as flintlock triggers, to prevent them jamming.

Applying syckle oil to a bladed melee weapon or primitive firearm allows the user to re-roll any failed Test that would result in it being broken or Jammed. An application of the oil lasts for 1d10+4 attacks with the weapon or 12 hours, whichever comes first.

#### **Fedrid Soul Mask**

These ornate, bizarre and often frightening masks are employed by the native hunters of Fedrid as a sinister form of defence. Soaked in the blood of beasts (and some say ritually murdered rivals), these outsized masks are worn on the back with the common belief that the trapped soul within will flinch with anticipation if danger stalks up behind the wearer. Unsurprisingly these macabre items of "primitive art" grace the walls of many a private study on Scintilla and elsewhere and fetch high prices. The stories of strange hauntings, bloody histories and native curses clinging to such masks only adds to the frisson of owning one for some.

# Miscellany Miscellany

<span id="page-105-0"></span>One major difference between primitive and advanced worlds is in the services a traveller might find or require. As with the gear and weaponry to be found on primitive worlds, the lifestyles and comforts are downright primitive too. O

#### **Consumables** Consumables

Much of what primitive world folk consume defies description, and sometimes taste! What follows is a brief sample of the more palatable offerings.

#### **Belly-churn**

Popular with nomadic peoples, the belly-churn is an animal stomach filled with milk, sewn shut and then flung over the side of a riding beast to slowly curdle. The resulting cheese is regarded as a delicacy and also keeps "fresh" a remarkably long time, making it the ideal ration for a lengthy journey.

#### **Spirit Tonic, Munsk**

Originating from the planet of Munsk in the Josian Reach, spirit tonic is an alcoholic brew produced mainly on the northern continent. Its ingredients are not wildly known, though, there are rumours that the corpses of the small rodents dominating that area of the planet may be the primary ingredient, however, such whispers have yet to be proven. Regardless, steed tonic is infamous for its wretched flavour, inspiring many theories about just what exactly is in it.

Known to its detractors as "coward juice", consuming a measure of this foul fluid inspires a degree of "courage" to the imbiber. The natives of Munsk believe a swig can dull the pangs of fear and thus nearly all warriors drink the fluid before hunting, waging war or confronting their spouse.

This vile concoction conceals a powerful narcotic poison, once ingested it grants a +10 bonus on all Fear Tests made for the next 1d5 hours. However, it impairs judgment, inflicting a –10 penalty on all Intelligence based Tests during this period. This substance is also addictive and more than capable of inflicting permanent brain damage in a frequent user.

#### **Styger Milk, Fervious**

The Styger is a beast of burden found on Fervious. Shortly after a Styger gives birth to a whelp, it produces a viscous fluid on which its young feeds. So thick is this vile substance that when a human consumes it, the milk coats the throat, windpipe and stomach for up to a day after being ingested. As well as being full of nutrients and proteins, the people of Fervious have found that the milk engenders resilience to poisons and toxins.

The Styger milk is so effective at neutralizing toxins that all Fervious's nobles, as a matter of course, drink it before eating. This has led to substantial trade for Styger dairy farmers who, before the discovery of the milk's benefits, were nothing more

than just peasants. Now the dairy farmers have grown rich and powerful in their own right, fighting amongst themselves in the hopes of gaining a monopoly.

Anyone who drinks a dose of Styger milk gains a +20 Resistance to ingested poisons. The effects of Styger milk last for 1d5 hours, however, its long-term effects can be unpleasant, and aside from degrading the user's sense of taste, every time it is used the drinker must take a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer 1 point of permanent Toughness Damage.

#### **Services** Services

Lacking the amenities found on more advanced worlds, most people of the Imperium have little to no idea of how to deal with ordinary troubles when they find themselves on a feral or feudal world. Hence, those offering particular services to off-worlders can make a lucrative living.

#### **Guard**

Hired muscle can guard a camp, an object or even your very life if sufficiently motivated. The price of a guard can vary greatly (at the GMs discretion) depending on their ability and disposition.

#### **Guide**

Whether a cunning huntsman, streetwise link-boy or turncoat tribesman, a guide is invaluable in navigating the foetid forests of a feral world or the narrow streets of a feudal city.

#### **Medicae (Feral)**

Using a mixture of faith, luck and herbal remedies, a feral world healer is often the shaman of the local tribe, or else an experienced mother who knows all manner of folk cures. Smoke, prayer, insects and strange fungi are common components of feral world medicine.

### **Medicae (Feudal)**

Equipped with tools such as scalpels, pliers and leeches, a doctor from a feudal world can heal a character with but an average amount of mummery, unpleasant cures and guess work.

#### **Parasite Removal**

Whether it's a flea-ridden feudal king or a worm-raddled forest warrior, sooner or later, people on primitive worlds need their parasites removed. Treatments can vary a great deal and may include mysterious methods such as smoke baths, sand scrubs, lice combs, purgatives and other less savoury practices.

#### **Porters**

Hired from the local populace, often for little more than the price of a meal, porters can carry an unfeasibly large amount of goods and equipment upon their shoulders.

#### **Trophy Maker**

On many primitive worlds, the inhabitants take trophies from notable kills, dead relatives or defeated enemies. A visit to the trophy maker sees the object properly preserved for display. From shrunken heads to bleached bones and stuffed animals, all sorts of keepsakes can be made.

*"New to the hive my noble sir? No, don't take me amiss! I'm here to help you, see? Outworlder are we? I can tell of course, not just the accent you understand, or the dress. Not used to the crowds are we sir? Getting buffeted and pushed along like that? Confused? Lost? Why if I hadn't found you you'd be dipped and clipped in the blink of a scarab's eye! You'll feel better out of the press, come along, this isn't a safe level you know?! What a fine specimen you are sir, if you don't mind me saying… 'long of limb and clean of skin' as we say in the inhumation business… this way sir, down here, just one more stairwell… I know some friends of mine that will take to you right off, well, parts of you anyway…"*

— Vargo "Redjack" Heit, Hive Sibellus Viscerator.

This chapter details a wide variety of weapons and equipment that can be found or encountered on the diverse hive worlds of the Calixis Sector. Most hive worlds are manufacturing centres of wide range and colossal output, as well as the homes of billions. They are T

the Imperium at its most frenetic, industrious and unified, but they are also places of great injustice, totalitarian control and savage lawlessness. In their dark recesses hide terrible lurking dangers. Here you'll find the playthings of the rich, desperate weapons of rebellion and the tools of the killer's trade. You'll also come across the base trappings of daily life common to many, black market goods peddled from the shadows and numerous strange technological devices whose workings are far beyond the understanding of those who rely on them.

The Calixis Sector is a place of contrasts and its hives are no less so. Each has its own eccentricities of culture, custom and character, and each soul born there is a reflection of the world that made them. Indeed, the weapons and tools that you'll find here reflect their origins too, be it a finely crafted blade from the sub-sea cities of Landunder or a Voligite Mercy Killer; crudely made and almost as dangerous to the firer as the target.

This chapter is by no means exhaustive. To try and detail every possible weapon or interesting item from just the hives of Calixis would take up hundreds of pages. What you will find here should give you both a useful almanac of hive world weapons and goods, and importantly a flavour of what is like to live and die beneath a steel sky.

*"No Hector, the Adeptus Astartes are the Emperor's angels given form—you couldn't even lift one of their weapons, even when you're all grown-up. But that pretty thing there's meant for us mere mortals to handle, and more than enough to kill any man alive. Now come away from the glass dear, your father's waiting."*

— Jocaster Moncreath of House Moncreath, The Legation Quarter, Malfi.

What follows is a selection of ranged weapons that specifically hail from hive worlds throughout the Calixis Sector. W

#### **Bolt Weapons** Bolt Weapons

#### **Angelus Bolt Carbine**

#### **Class:** Basic (Bolt)

The fanes of Gunmetal, among their most important duties, hold an oath-bond to manufacture the casing and primary propulsion charges for Astartes calibre bolt shells. Production of the Astartes bolts is carefully controlled and monitored, and once made, each case is stamped with the aquila and its maker's mark before being passed on to the Adepts of the Machine God. Despite the security and precautions inherent in this sacred duty, it is said a few of these shells never see the aquila stamp. These so called "blind shells" are both utterly illegal and highly desirable, but on their own, blind shells are useless without a weapon to fire them. Consequently, the Fane of Fykos makes in secret a weapon known as the "Angelus". Bluntly elegant in shape and crafted from the finest materials, the Angelus's lacquered stock houses its magazine and unlocks to take three Astartes calibre bolt shells snugly nose to tail. Provided only to their richest and most trustworthy of clients, the exclusivity and terrible killing power of the Angelus is favoured by the wealthiest of bounty hunters and the most accomplished of beast-slayers in the Calixis Sector. Carrying one of these powerful, but highly illegal weapons entails certain risks all of its own.

#### **Cinder Crag Forge "Mauler" Bolt Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

A singular weapon to say the least, the Mauler is a finely made bolt pistol designed for normal human hands (unlike the far larger, heavier calibre models intended for use by the legendary Space Marines). Extremely sophisticated in design and made by necessity from the finest alloys and components, each Mauler is handmade and forged by the servitor-savants of the Cinder Crag. Each weapon is uniquely tailored to the commissioner's exact biometric data. The result is a weapon as implacably lethal as it is as perfect an artefact.

Mauler pistols made by commission cost twice the listed price and count as Best quality weapons when used by the hand they were crafted for (see Chapter V: Armoury of Dark Heresy).

#### **Volg "Spitfire" Bolt Pistol Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

Little more than a crudely modified Lucifer pattern launcher (a handgun-like device common on frontier worlds for firing signal flares, tow lines and the like), the Spitfire was an innovation that, according to popular myth, was devised by an outcast Magnavar tech-adept named Verey. The story has it that while she was exiled in Volg, she made the first Spitfires to help combat a swarming of giant Maw-flukes. The weapon proved both effective and popular, and the more talented of Volg's arms dealers have been turning them out ever since. The Spitfire's fame and construction has spread and some are even sold at inflated prices as real "bolt pistols" to those too provincial or naive to know better!

Spitfires use modified rocket-propelled distress flares fitted with a crude impact detonators in a pale imitation of a bolt shell, but are nevertheless still quite deadly. Spitfire rounds will ignite flammable materials and on Critical Hits their targets must Test Agility or be set on fire in addition to any other effect.

Spitfire shells are also far from stable and any Jam result automatically incurs an Explosive Mishap (Damage is directed at the firer, who must Test Agility or be set on fire). Likewise if Spitfire ammunition is hit by an explosion or flame weapon, it may detonate (65% chance) dealing 1d10+3 points of Damage to the user.

Spitfire shells are themselves Scarce with a base cost of 5 Thrones per reload.

*"Rest you well my pretty one, and keep you safe the long night through.* 

*Stray you not from the light, to crooked stair and darkened door,*

*For the Sleepers wait there empty eyed, my child, With a clockwork kiss to still your heart."*

— Lullaby fragment translated from the local dialect, Hive Gloriana, Solomon.

#### **Aegis-Redback Pattern Heavy Webber**

**Class:** Exotic (Heavy Webber)

The advanced design for this heavy webber is held by the Adeptus Mechanicus of the Lathe System and the weapons themselves are produced only under granted licence by the Hax-Orthlack manufactorums on the sector capital world of Scintilla. Standard issue for Adeptus Arbites capture-units across the Calixis Sector and also carried in the armouries of the better equipped local law enforcement units, such as the Magistratum of Scintilla, the weapon takes the form of a heavy, wide-barrelled projector fed from a large canister worn on the user's back. The weapon's use is often reserved for when large numbers of targets are to be taken alive for interrogation or where important bystanders are caught in the line of fire.

#### **Belasco Galvian Needler**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Galvian)

Another Belasco Deathworks weapon of dubious provenance, this advanced and elegant needle pistol is designed for close-range work. The pistol also has the dubious distinction of being the weapon used for the infamous murder of Cardinal Tyndale and a dozen other deacons and priests at the famed "sorrowful matins" massacre on Gallowglass, the deliberate infection of the lauded High Lady Alatia of House Krin with Mori immedicabalis, and numerous other high profile killings over the years. This has lead to the House of Belasco being denounced from the cathedral pulpit as "sinful deathmongers" on several occasions, a claim the Belasco family have not deigned to refute.

For an additional 300 Thrones, a modified Galvian can be bought fitted on a special hidden rig that is worn on the user's forearm, fired by means of a special palm trigger. This version has the Concealable attribute.

**Needler**

#### **The Belasco Deathworks**

The manufactora of the powerful House of Belasco on Malfi mass-produce standard pattern small arms and energy cells to feed the Malfian sub's planetary defence forces and numerous petty sub-sector war zones. Their elite arm, the grimly named Belasco Deathworks, is said to have begun its existence as the armourer to the House's own frighteningly large assassin cadre. They produce a considerable number of speciality arms, such as sniper weapons, compact pistols, bespoke toxins, implant weapons and other murderous devices. Thanks to Malfi's thriving culture of vendetta, the Belasco have no shortage of local buyers for their wares and, additionally, many of the Deathworks's products are also "sold on" further afield through House Belasco's long standing links to the Machenko Dynasty and their trans-sector trade network.

#### **Artifico-Biologis, 0.5 I Hypo Pistol**

**Class:** Exotic (Hypo Pistol)

This compact and intricate handgun, crafted from clockwork and brass, is a Cult Mechanicus device used by the Magos Biologis and their agents to subdue living specimens. By the use of a cunningly fashioned mechanical spring, it fires a short-range injector dart fitted with a penetrating filament that delivers a chemical payload directly into the target's bloodstream. Nominally a tool for the Biologis or Medicae, it is actually quite commonly found in the hands of bounty hunters, criminal scum or even enforcers who want to take their prey alive. The weapon has its most sinister reputation on the hive world of Solomon, where an often-purged and darkly fabled cult known as the "sleepers" have been using these devices to abduct victims for so long that they and their predations have become a tale to frighten children.

Flamers

The usual payload for a hypo pistol is strixis tincture, a powerful soporific, although, almost any chemical, toxin or even viral agent could be used. When filled with the strixis tincture, any living target damaged by the weapon must pass a Hard (–20) Toughness Test or fall comatose for 1d10 × 3 minutes. On a failure by three or more degrees, the target is comatose for 1d5 hours instead.

Injector darts are designed not to unduly harm their targets. Roll for Damage as normal to overcome the target's Toughness Bonus and Armour Points. Any Damage in excess is reduced to 1 point.

Hypo-pistol ammo is Scarce and each hypo-dart has a base cost of 8 Thrones each.
