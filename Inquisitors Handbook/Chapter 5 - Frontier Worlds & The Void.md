# Chapter V: Frontier Worlds & The Void

#### **Ration Grubs**

The world of Dusk is far more famed for its extreme deadliness than the rare few creatures that can aid one's life instead of quickly ending it. Still, it is from the swamps of Dusk that the exceedingly useful ration grubs hail. Originally discovered during a survey by an Adeptus Mechanicus Genetor explorator team, ration grubs are a phenomenally rich source of nutrients. A single freeze-dried grub, which is about the size of a man's thumb, provides a subsistence level of nutrients sufficient for a full day, however, the grub's indescribably foul taste and trace toxins make it a poor choice for a long term diet.

Some seasoned travellers like to joke that, as natives of Dusk, ration grubs continue to be deadly to one's appetite if nothing else.

#### **Spectorin Coral Paste**

*"Three years spent orbiting such a rich abundance of sea life as to beggar belief. Three years of constant experimentation, straining the patience of my lords and patrons. Three years of knowing that millions suffer throughout this sector for want of food. Three years of failure. Our latest submersible was destroyed today, a thousand men lost in an instant to the titanic mouth of a Lantern Jaw. This world may not hate us, but it surely hates our works. It matters not. I will find a way. If it takes a millennia, I will find a way."*

— From the early personal data-files of Magos Genetus Halix Redole.

When the Lord Militant Angevin's world surveyors first discovered the water world Spectoris, they were delighted by the vast quantities of fish that the planet seemed to promise and readily noted it as a potential agri-world for future use. As the population of the Calixis Sector grew, so to did its need for food. In 312.M41, the Sector Governor declared that the time had come to begin harvesting the piscine crop of Spectoris, a task that was to prove far easier to order than to achieve. The Imperium swiftly found that the denizens of Spectoris routinely destroyed all foreign objects that were placed within the worldocean, effectively halting any large-scale collection efforts. For decades the legendary "complete ocean" held the Imperium at bay, leading many to believe that the world-ocean itself was sentient in some inexplicable manner.

#### **The Magos Genetus and the Adranti**

Genetor Redole's research on Spectoris turned up far more than has ever been revealed publicly. Spectoris's proximity to the Adrantis Nebulae led Redole to suspect it had at one time been a testing ground for the infamous deviant genetic tampering of the Adranti. This struck at the very core of Redole's beliefs and he swore to the Omnissiah that if it took him a lifetime, he would unlock the keys to wiping out the scourge of Adranti genetic corruption.

For more than four hundred years, Redole grappled with the twisted legacy of the Adranti. His lifelong efforts and the seemingly endless series of discoveries that his research uncovered eventually led to him being elevated to the exalted rank of Magos Genetus. When he knew that his life's fire was all but spent, he turned copies of the bulk of his research notes over to the Lathes and to the Ordo Calixis. Access to Redole's notes is tightly restricted, for every single person that has since dared to walk in his footsteps has uniformly gone mad… or worse. As for the Magos Genetus, while most believe him to be dead, some whisper that a master of the forces of life is not so easily toppled…

At last, frustrated by their inability to progress, the Adeptus Mechanicus turned to one of their more eclecticminded members, the somewhat infamous, Genetor Halix Redole. Genetor Redole was known to be associated with a faction within the Mechanicus known as the Organicists, a group of tech-priests who esteemed biological enhancement as being equal in value with the cybernetic, a somewhat radical if not heretical position from the tech-adepts point of view. Redole applied his keen intellect to the "Spectoris problem" for five years before hitting on a solution. The Genetor discovered that a form of sea life roughly analogous to terrestrial coral was attracted to certain chemicals. By blending the chemicals with a bonding agent derived from a Spectorin fish, Redole created the compound known as coral paste. The paste draws Spectorin coral to whatever it is applied to, soon creating a "natural" layer of sea life that causes the creatures of the world-ocean to regard the encrusted vessel as native. The Genetor's success opened the way to large scale Imperial harvesting, and coral paste is now regularly applied to all Spectorin ships, no matter their size, as well as being repeatedly caked across the entire hull of the planet's sole underwater habitat, Enkaidan. Coral paste has proven to be useful to the colonists of Spectoris as a makeshift hull repair agent on a number of occasions. Its utility is marred by the fact it must be reapplied frequently, else the coral covering can deteriorate with lethal results. Coral paste is a highly regulated substance due to the extreme value of a great many Spectorin species of fish, which inevitably brings poachers.

# <span id="page-156-0"></span>The Void The Void

*"Sure, there are dangers aplenty in the gulfs of the void and a ship is never quite big enough for comfort and who knows what flits in the chill of eternal night, but I'd take all of that over a foetid hive or the cruel embrace of a death world any day."*

— Dirty Fikke, Rogue Trader.

The worlds of the Calixis Sector may appear quite varied, and indeed they are, but no matter their unique environment and social development, they are all at the gross level just simple worlds of rock, water and air. There is another area in the sector, however, separated from these base planets that are home to countless millions. It is made of adamantium and glassteel, plasma reactors and atmospheric recyclers. It is the many vessels leaping through the warp in defiance of natural laws, orbiting worlds to defend or monitor, trading between societies but never being part of them, navigating by the Emperor's divine light alone. They make up a totally unique habitat, as varied as the myriad planets of Calixis are from each other but still unified as artificial constructs totally divorced from nature. T A

For most who travel through the void, such a life is all they ever know. Only a small percentage will ever actually touch real soil or breathe fresh air. To live in the void is to be apart from the rest of humanity, in worlds where light, air, food and even gravity are in the hands of faceless tech-adepts and enginseers who tend to the blessed life-sustaining machines. Here unseen creatures scuttle through abandoned decks and death is only a bulkhead's thickness away. Voyaging through the immaterium can taint even the most steadfast of souls, so the Inquisition keeps a watchful eye for irregularities. If stellar and interstellar transportation cannot be trusted, Calixis would swiftly collapse into a bedlam of isolated worlds, easy pickings for waiting predators.

#### Naval Bases & Commercial Stations Naval Bases & Comm ercial Stations

As benefits any major sector of the Imperium, the Calixis Sector boasts a wide range of naval and commercial facilities to support travel amongst its star systems. Only a fraction are listed below as even a standard system might have dozens of stations of their own to support cargo transfers, defence monitoring, research, and so on.

**Port Wrath:** A huge combination dockyard and naval base serving as headquarters for Battlefleet Calixis. It half protrudes from a metallic planetoid orbiting Mundus, a white dwarf star in the Golgenna Reach, and bristles with lance batteries matching the firepower of most fleets. Commanded for over fifty years by Rear-Admiral Zoila Kusch, this is the mainstay Imperial Navy installation in the sector.

**Port Gavinus:** Centred in the Golgenna Reach, Gavinus is one of the most popular commercial shipping stations in the sector. For the thousands of smaller merchant vessels who also ply the Scintilla-Sepheris Secundus-Iocanthus trade route (also known as the Golgenna Triangle) along with the Misericord, this serves as their home in space. On the surface a respectable base, the sheer amount of traffic means that a powerful underclass of black market dealing goes on as well.

**Port Wander:** For those venturing towards the Halo Stars, Port Wander is often the last stop before leaving the sector and a welcome harbour should they return. It orbits an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant beyond the Drusus Marches, and provides basic facilities for everything from Rogue Traders to small Void Jumpers in the area. Somewhat of a frontier station, it is popular with many a vessel (and crew) of dubious legality.

#### **Travelling in Space**

Imperial vessels rely on two kinds of drives which make space travel possible; warp engines which allow for passage between the stars through the nightmare realm of the Empyrean, and plasma drives which provide thrust and propel a ship through the cold void of realspace. All ships need the latter for mundane travel inside a star system, as operating warp engines too close to massive objects such as planets or stars can cause unforgivable results ranging from being tossed off course thousands of light years to outright implosion from warp rip-tides. Plasma drives are tough and reliable, and powerful enough to move a ship from one end of a system to the other in a reasonable amount of time. Heavy thrusters are used for planetary landings and take-off, as the huge amounts of hard radiation produced from a plasma drive are generally lethal for most environments. All of these drives reflect basic Imperial technology—powerful, blunt and unforgiving.

The mechanisms that enable space travel are often overlooked by the common sorts of citizenry of the Imperium, for a variety of systems mask the experiences one would expect from travelling through the void. One conspicuous absence is weightlessness—in fact, many people do not realise that they even should be floating about inside their tiny ships. Grav plating throughout the ship allows humanity to travel in a somewhat normal manner. Grav plates are mostly autonomous once activated, creating a pseudo-gravity field complete with inertial compensation. Most ships replicate one Holy Terra standard but a few customise to slightly more or less of that level. Like most Imperial technologies, the secrets of grav plate construction are now almost lost and thus even the smallest vessel (and its integrated plating) is a priceless artefact to be maintained and preserved for generations.

#### <span id="page-157-0"></span>**FamousVessels**

While the infamous Misericord is perhaps the most well known spacecraft in the sector, many other vessels ply the stars of Calixis and have made named for themselves.

*Angevin's Destiny***:** This ancient Imperial battleship is the flagship of Battlefleet Calixis and regarded as the saviour at the Battle of Markayn.

*Belasarro***:** A passenger transport ship plying the Drusus Marches, it has never missed a scheduled run in over 350 years.

*Calixius Esme***:** This Imperial destroyer is noted for leading fleets on successful punitive campaigns against Dust Raiders lurking in the Fydae System.

*Constant Measure***:** This cargo ship is famed for keeping systems beyond the Markayn Marches supported when warp storms threatened isolation. Millions of survivors named their offspring after the ship and crew in gratitude.

*Craneshank***:** A Free Charter merchant trader operating off the standard routes in the Maffaian sub-sector, it is known for accepting almost any hire (as long as the Thrones are golden).

*Faith Eternal***:** Principally a pilgrim ship that carries the faithful to (and sometimes from) Sentinel, it is distinguished by an apocryphal story claiming that its Geller field failed once in transit, but the righteous chanting of its passengers kept the ship protected until it could safely exit the immaterium.

*Halfhund***:** A light tramp freighter working the coreward archipelagos, it has garnered a reputation for both speed and discreteness, staying just on the coreward side of respectability.

*Krystyna***:** Noted for discovering the extinct Egerian Dominion, this Rogue Trader set off a rush to exploit the civilization's dead maze-cities for black market artefacts.

*Mirabelle***:** This famous high-end passenger liner offers pleasure cruises around the wondrously glowing Adrantis Nebula. *Path of Drusus***:** A pilgrim ship still tracing the saint's route made before his ascension. As the complete voyage lasts 147 years though, "reaching Scintilla" has become an oft-heard saying for a task unlikely to be finished.

**Drystan Construction Yards:** Though new naval vessels are exceedingly rare, the yards at Drystan still stay operational. Established soon after Saint Drusus took office, the yards slowly produce military ships, or more commonly work repairs on those extensively damaged. As it is near the spinward boarder, Yard-Admiral Nar'akot does some side business on vessels from there as well. This does lead to some interesting exchanges between naval personnel and "private" citizens, most taking place in the Yard's taverns and most cleaned up by the following morning.

**Kormisoshi Dockyards:** Many commercial construction and repair needs are served by the Kormisoshi Dockyards, more centrally located to the coreward of Tranch. Second only to rival Harluff Yards, Kormisoshi handles everything from Navigator Housefleet Primats and Chartist Greatholds to System Hoppers and Limpet Boats. Run by the Kormisoshi-Targ Corporation and operated by Hereditary Yardmaster Petronella Jansson, the station also does brisk business selling smaller ships whose captains could not finish paying for repair work.

**Diogenes IV Research Station:** One of many Adeptus Mechanicus installations scattered across the sector operated by the Lords of Mars. Tenuously (and dangerously) anchored in the centre of a pulsar cluster on the rimward border, its thousands of servitor-cogitators gather and digest data on this mysterious constellation. It receives little notice and few inquisitive visitors, which perfectly suits those running the station.

**41 Pry:** Tucked away from the regular trade routes, barely operational and mostly forgotten by respectable merchant fleets. Stations like 41 Pry serve a more disreputable clientele and are not places to venture into lightly. It is best to keep one hand on your pistol and the other on your geltbag.

For every base still in operation, though, there are multitudes of abandoned or derelict stations scattered across the void, each home to pirates or worse. Sabriel is one such facility, a forgotten outpost in the Periphery. Averick Rox, a somewhat successful smuggler, rediscovered the station by accident decades ago and began using it as a base of operations. Since then it has grown and now caters to a wide assortment of crews, ranging from the morally flexible to the downright illegal.

#### **Common Merchant & Commercial Vessels**  Common Merchant & Commercial Vessels

Broadly speaking, the non-military vessels of the sector are transports. Some only haul cargo, others only passengers, but most carry a mix of the two. All legitimate craft operate under an Imperial charter, granting them the right to fly lawfully between stars. Some charters allow only for travel along specific routes, while others allow for travel anywhere. Many charters date back thousands of years and it is a rare thing for a new charter to be granted. Most vessels operate in fleets, the better to protect each other from raiders (and rival merchants) as well as facilitate cargo loading and unloading.

As in most sectors, Chartist captains dominate the stars of Calixis. Operating without Navigators or Astropaths (luxuries normally affordable only to the military or planetary governments), they rely on carefully maintained star charts to make journeys from point to point. Some of these maps cover paths of relative safety for warp travel and must be followed precisely. This often means extremely circuitous routes, such that a linear path of tens of light years might entail dozens of jumps totalling hundreds of light years of travel. But for some systems, such a route is the only way possible. Often these planets may go generations without a visit if they are especially distant.

#### **Space Hulks**

Given the unforgiving currents and eddies moving through the immaterium, vessels can sometimes become ripped from their planned course and forever gripped by warp tides. Some eventually translate back into realspace far from their scheduled location or time, but most are doomed to wander the galaxy at random. As other ships become trapped by similar currents they are forcibly rammed together (or worse fused together as they emerge back into realspace), forming impossibly large conglomerations. These hulks can hold lost technology dating back to times before the Imperium was founded or even materials from xenos crafts. When a hulk appears it sets off a mad scramble to plunder it before it vanishes back into the warp. Each appears as a ghost ship, derelict of crew and easy pickings. However, they are far from empty, often containing entombed scavengers or xenos races using hulks as crude transports. Hosts of predatory and aggressive creatures can lurk within, waiting for others to venture inside. The fact that most relic hunters are well aware of these dangers serves to illustrate how valuable any discoveries that might be onboard can be.

#### **Bulk Cargo Transports**

Of the Chartist ships, bulk cargo transports are the most numerous. In Calixis space, Greatholds are the largest, dwarfing all but gargantuan vessels such as Emperor-class battleships or unique monstrosities like the *Misericord*. Each Greathold can carry enough goods such that offloading takes dozens of months. Almost as large are the Excolati refinery ships which take this a step further and actively process raw materials during the trip, so products such as weapons-grade promethium are ready to deliver on arrival.

When one of these huge vessels arrives at a planet, it is an occasion noted all over the system. While the Misericord is infamous for the bad luck it brings, other arrivals are a cause of celebration and holidays as it means badly needed medicines and foodstuffs as well as new toys and diversions for the local rulers. As the saying goes, when the Governor is happy, everyone else eats better.

#### **Transports**

There is a limited demand for pure passenger ships, as most travellers make do with transport ship accommodations. For those who can afford it though, there are several options for connecting the more populous and powerful systems for the nobility and corporate lords. Pilgrim Ships are the more common type, dedicated to taking the faithful to and from planets of spiritual note or allowing them to retrace the steps of the favoured saints.

Mixed passenger and cargo transports are the most common type to be found, primarily carrying one while also providing limited space for the other. Sizes range widely, but most are medium level crafts that can service most of the sector depending on their charter type. Short-range system Hoppers and Void Jumpers for example usually operate under low-level Hereditary Charters. They work short-range trading routes between nearby systems, normally only making one or two jumps to reach their destination. Smaller tramp freighters are also widespread, working without regular routes and barely surviving from one job to the next. For Imperial agents, especially those wishing a low profile, these types of ships can be a common means of transportation throughout Calixis.

#### **Other Vessels**

While not actual ships, most systems host a variety of other space-born facilities. These include orbiting centres such as planetary monitors and docks, beacon stations, emergency lifehouses and more. Some are as large as small moons and act as the major nexuses of commerce and shipping for a system, while others may be little more than a refitted cargo hold conducting research on the fringes of the system.

#### **System Ships**

System ships are just that: lacking warp engines they operate within the system using plasma drives alone. A civilized system might have hundreds working to move cargo and people throughout its space, while lower level planets may only have a handful to support larger transports on their arrival. Most captains look down on these vessels, but they are vital in systems with multiple inhabited planets or stations.

#### **Ship Quality**

The standard vessel is of Common craftsmanship. There may be a few failed grav plates and the air may smell a bit, with occasional problems to make the passage interesting in ways not imagined (or desired) by the passengers. Overall, they are fairly dependable and reliable. To create ships of differing standards, use the following modifications:

**Poor:** The ship is barely able to hold atmosphere, with minor hull leaks and plasma drive failures a common occurrence. Much of the ship resembles a junkyard, patched together with random parts and purity seals. It would be wise to sleep with one eye open and a ready pistol when travelling. Expect a true adventure during the passage; you are bound to pick up a few stories to tell at the next bar should you ever arrive.

**Good:** A step above the standard, with wellmaintained decks and regular prayer sessions to maintain the spiritual wellbeing of the ship and its crew. There might be some problems during the voyage, but usually none that are too life threatening.

**Best:** A trip of relaxed calm awaits, as if the Emperor Himself was watching over you. If it weren't for your upcoming mission and the high cost of the passage, you would probably never depart.

<span id="page-159-0"></span>Limpet Boats are small craft carried onboard Greatholds or other gargantuan ships, and are designed to detach once the main craft has reached its destination. Limpets then scurry about transporting cargo, shuttling crew and passengers, and performing other necessary tasks to ensure that the parent ship will be ready for its next journey.

Shuttles and Lighters are another common craft, working only between their home planet and any orbiting vessels. When a new ship arrives to their planet, they blast into space vying for any work to be had. These boats are also useful for fast (but expensive) planetside transport as well.

And then there are the Rogue Traders. Each as eclectic and unique as their master, they can range from one vessel to many. Rogue Traders operate almost as a law unto themselves; with no boundaries except those proscribed in their charter, they roam the edges of the galaxy in search of new worlds to exploit.

#### **Catching <sup>a</sup> Ride**

Unless you have access to a dedicated vehicle (perhaps your Inquisitor has a permanent arrangement with a Chartist captain, or even owns his own ship), you will need to manage your own travel arrangements. Most of the time this is a relatively straightforward affair as most planetary docks have procedures to arrange berths on passenger ships. Most transport captains are also willing to take on some passengers and indicate their destinations and rates at the docks as well. If you're in need of transportation to a location not listed, though, or need arrangements outside the norm (such as expeditious speed, possibly illegal cargo or travel to forbidden worlds) then some serious negotiations will be needed. Having plenty of Thrones or bartering merchandise on your person can aid this process immeasurably.

Most Inquisitorial agents refrain from simply commandeering a vessel on the authority of their rosette, and save that as a last resort to be used only when regular means such as payment, bribery and subtle threats fail. Keeping the negotiations "sub-rosa" helps maintain good working relations with the merchant fleets and helps ensure that the next time you need a ride things go smoothly. It also helps keep them in business and available for you in future endeavours. Indeed, if you treat them well, most captains look forward to your repeat business, thus making life easier for all parties concerned.

#### **Passage in Space** Passage in Space

Once you have secured passage, there are two main types of service that can affect your voyage: your accommodations and the meals provided. Obviously things can vary from ship to ship, so GMs should feel free to improvise and create new prices and offerings as desired to ensure a memorable crossing for their Acolytes. The information below can be used as a guide in setting these rates. Bon Voyage!

B**erthing:** This covers all manner of lodgings to be found on a ship, from the barely liveable to the sumptuously extravagant.

**Shipboard Meals:** This includes any kind of consumables such as foodstuffs and beverages to be considered part of your passage fee. Travellers can bring their own foodstuffs or rations if they desire, but have to pay extra for the additional cargo space.

The cost of a service, given in Thrones, indicates only a single overnight accommodation or a single meal. GMs should modify these rates depending on such things as travel through dangerous regions (battle zones, quarantined areas) and journeys longer than the vessel normally takes.

### <span id="page-160-0"></span>Ranged Weapons Rang ed Weapons

*"All hands, brace for impact. Armsmen to decks three and four to repel boarders. Passengers will please remain in their quarters for the duration of this unscheduled event. That is all."*

— Avery Tokkle, Captain, Astrella Adrantis.

While somewhat rarer than on land, open combat does take place even on spacecraft travelling through the void. Whether repelling borders, putting down an indentured underclass uprising, or fighting off attacks from the "nightmare holds", crewmen face a barrage of enemies and thus need weapons. Many of these are regular weapons used elsewhere in the Imperium. Most, however, can easily puncture hull plating as they would a body, leaving fighters on both sides to "kiss the void", as common parlance goes. W Flame Weapons

To prevent this, a well-equipped vessel maintains stocks of weapons designed for the safety of the ship as well as combat. These generally feature a much lower penetrating strike to prevent accidental breaches. Several are deliberately designed to be less lethal, as they are often used to force recalcitrant deckhands to return to work. As fighting can take place in claustrophobic corridors with little or no time before faceto-face conflict ensues, most are also heavily reinforced and weighted so they can double as a club as well. Range is never a serious factor, as only the most massive of ships have long open spaces of any note.

Often these weapons can be procured on trading stations or dockyards, where down-on-their-luck spacers barter their possessions for repair gelt or to cover gambling debts. They are fairly common in backwater weaponshops or dealerships as well. It's also possible to trade or barter for them while travelling, especially on low-grade transports with laxer standards. In any case, if an Acolyte plans on extensive space travelling, having weapons designed for fighting in these conditions is worth serious consideration.

#### **Flame Weapons Anoxis Burst Pattern Flamer**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

Also known (very informally) as "Hax's Breath", this flamer variant weapon shoots a quick pulse of fire designed more to frighten and repel than seriously injure. Unlike regular flame weapons, they do not spray a promethium stream so the targets are not smothered with flammable liquid. Unless hit at point-blank range, targets instead receive a burst of heat that may singe eyebrows or ignite loose clothing, but do not suffer any significant burns.

#### **Anoxis Pattern "Stingray" Rifle**

#### **Class:** Basic (Flame)

Stingrays emit a powerful microwave beam in a wide arc. The radiation causes immediate blistering heat on exposed skin (similar to a powerful insect sting, thus giving its name) with no danger of harming most other objects. Stingrays are ideal weapons for when crewmen need to repel unruly crew (or passengers). Even though a Stingray rifle has the Flame special quality it cannot set things on fire.

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons Cypra Mundi "Ironclaw" Shotgun** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

These standard shipboard weapons are designed to resist the rigors of the void and have a reinforced, weighted stock, which can double as a club (1d10–2+SB I) if needed. Storage lockers filled with Ironclaws are commonplace on military vessels and unlock automatically to arm the crew when the signal is given to repel boarders.

#### **Cypra Mundi "Irontalon" Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

A favoured naval officer's sidearm in the Segmentum Obscurus, it uses special fragmenting ammunition designed to violently stop a target dead in its tracks without undue risk to a ship's hull. The pistol itself is also very sturdy and designed to be used as a cudgel in emergences (treat as a club). Most are engraved with their issuing vessel's mark, making those from famous warships extremely valuable to wealthy collectors. The Irontalon's specialised fragmenting ammunition is itself classed as Rare and valued at 30 thrones per clip on the black market (and may only be used with this pistol). Normal auto-rounds may be used if desired but if this is the case the Tearing and Primitive qualities do not apply to the damage.

#### **Naval Shotcannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (SP)

Shotcannons can lay waste to hordes of attackers in the confined spaces of a shipboard action and a close-range hit from one can literally explode a man into a spray of shredded clothing and flesh. These huge weapons generate a fearsome recoil when fired and must be securely mounted or fired from a braced position to be effectively used (-30 to hit otherwise).

#### **Shotgun Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Compact single shot hand cannon, designed to fire shotgun cartridges. These weapons are often the preferred sidearm of petty officers and bosuns who carry them to discourage any thoughts of mutiny, earning the

weapon the nickname of "persuaders" in Naval slang. Due to their recoil, they impose a –10 penalty to hit if fired one-handed.

**"You are not free whose liberty is won by the rigour of other, more righteous souls. You are merely protected. Your freedom is parasitic, you suck the honourable man dry and offer nothing in return. You who have enjoyed freedom, who have done nothing to earn it, your time has come. This time you will stand alone and fight for yourselves. Now you will pay for your freedom in the currency of honest toil and human blood."**

## <span id="page-162-0"></span>Melee Weapons Me lee Weapons

As with ranged weapons, melee weapons are designed for versatility and use in tight places.

#### **Armoured Gauntlets**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Originally designed as protection when handling overheated conduit pipes or plasma coils, many armsmen have adapted them into melee weapons. The padded exteriors are stripped away and extra metal riveting is added, sometimes with spikes or other adornments to increase the force of each blow.

#### **Bulkhead Cutters**

#### **Class:** Exotic (Bulkhead Cutter)

As the name suggests, these are designed to rip open tough metal bulkheads and deck plating. They consist of an elaborate harness with a huge row of mechanical teeth running along the forearm and extending roughly 30 centimetres outwards. Often a torso support is also worn to make operating this heavy and cumbersome device easier for extended durations. As one can imagine, they can serve as intimidating combat weapons as well.

#### **Chimera Pistol Sword**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive) and Pistol (SP)

As many shipboard combats move from shooting to personal combat very quickly, it is common for many ranged weapons to also serve in close combat. Others take this approach in the opposite direction, and add a single-shot firearm to their sword. While the firearm can vary from person to person, most have the same range and effect as a standard Irontalon. This augmentation is often disguised as an ornate part of the sword or axe hilt, allowing the user to catch the enemy by surprise.

**Chimera Pistol Sword**

#### **Kraken Tooth Dagger**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Legends abound of gargantuan creatures hiding on the edges of system space, ready to attack vessels just as they emerge from the warp. Whilst no concrete evidence exists, huge pearlescent teeth have been fashioned into gleaming knives by many void born, who will only say that they were recovered from debris found in the void. Some are decorated with intricate scrimshaw carvings depicting horrendous beasts tearing apart ships, oddly enough making such daggers good luck charms.

#### **Man-Catcher**

**Class:** Melee (Primitive)

A long two-handed pole with a huge spring-loaded claw at the end, it is primarily used to corral mutineers. When the pole strikes an enemy the claws snap shut, trapping the foe in a harsh metal grip, which depending on the body part caught could ensnare, injure or even kill.

#### **Naval Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Naval armsmen often carry one of these, to protect them as they protect their vessel. Each shield is a huge solid plate of plasteel, rectangular and heavy. Unlike most Imperial shields they are flat and smooth surfaced, so that they can also be used as emergency hull or bulkhead sealers. A Naval shield can be used as cover, concealing the user completely if desired.

As cover a Naval shield provides 8 Armour Points.

#### **Neural Whip**

#### **Class:** Melee (Shock)

An advanced version of a regular whip, a neural whip can stun or kill outright through the massive electrical surges they impart as their long metallic lashes hit flesh. At low settings they are often used to "encourage" workers or ratings to increase their enthusiasm, whilst higher settings can drop an enemy dead in a single strike. Even unpowered, each blow from the whip lacerates bare flesh. Though it is not a thrown weapon, a neural whip has a longer range than most melee weapons and is able to strike foes up to three metres away.

#### **Officer's Cutlass**

#### **Class:** Melee (Shock)

The officer's cutlass is a standard variation on the basic cutlass sword and it sees use in almost every vessel in the sector. In close-quarters fighting, the heavy metal guard is often used as an offensive weapon in its own right as the armoured shell can provide a powerful punch. Many ship's officers and ratings heighten this effect by incorporating a shock generator in the guard, so that, when hit, an opponent is felled by both the electrical shock as well as the solid impact. Chartist captains and other higher rankings use even more lethal versions, strengthening their blades with power fields. The statistics shown on Table 5-7: Void Melee Weapons is for the Shock version.

#### **Shock - Staff**

**Class:** Melee (Shock)

A variant of the standard shock maul, it is made of a simple length of metal or plasteel with a single-setting shock emitter built into the far end. The shock-staff is mostly used in herding indentured workers pressed into service on the ship.

#### **Short Sword**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

As decks can be too cramped to effectively wield a normal sword, these shortened versions are popular with boarding parties and armsmen. Longer than a combat knife, but not by much, they are heavy and brutal weapons designed to stab rather than strike and most have wide flat blades which can be used for incapacitating side strikes.

#### **Anoxis Pattern Boarding Pike**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

One problem with most powerful close combat weapons is that they can easily punch through hull plating. Boarding pikes are a common shipboard solution, using a shell charge mounted at the end of a reinforced short metal staff. A trigger in the grip activates the charge to explode on contact. The explosion blasts into flesh with gruesome effect, but with little or no collateral damage to hull plating. It takes some time to reload, so it is used as a one-shot weapon and then acts as a club for the remainder of a combat.

<span id="page-164-0"></span>This section includes an assortment of miscellaneous gear including special forms of ammunition, armour and other gear useful for navigating the perils of the warp.

#### **Blazer Shells Ignitius Shotgun Shells**

These shells are packed with pyrotechnic materials, so when fired a huge gout of flame is produced for several seconds. While not as lethal as regular rounds, a volley excels at frightening off most

enemies. As they can also be used in standard shotguns, they offer excellent tactical flexibility without the need for specialised flamer weapons. The duration of the discharge means it can only be used in single-shot mode.

Blazer shotgun shells may be used with any shotgun and, when fired, reduce the weapon's Range to 15 metres unless that would be greater than its actual Range. In addition, they change the weapon's Damage type to Energy (E) and give it the Flame and Primitive qualities.

#### **Boarding Armour**

When conducting offensive actions or repelling enemy boarders, Naval armsmen often don these armoured kits. Each is a full flak suit, with carapace plating only on the front and a full helmet with faceplate and respirator. Designs can vary from ship to ship, but the overall suit is of common usage in the armed merchant vessels of the sector.

Boarding armour covers all locations providing 3 Armour Points of flak armour to the Legs and Arms and 5 Armour Points of carapace armour to the Head and Body. The armour also comes with a built-in Void Suit and photo-visor.

#### **Emergency Kits**

Most ships have emergency kits scattered about, and crewmen often carry around smaller versions. A full kit can include all of the following items:

**Glowstick:** Good for 1d5 hours of steady illumination. Universal Power Cell: Using either integral plugs or adaptor leads, it can power a glowstick or emergency vox for 1d5 hours or a laspistol for 5 shots.

**Ration pack and water canister:** Not much, but it will keep you from starving for an extra day. Hopefully your air is lasting that long.

**Emergency Vox:** Adjustable for any of the shipboard comm frequencies or can broadcast a standard "Prayer for Aid" on emergency channels.

**Air bottle and Mask:** Will keep you breathing for about 30 minutes.

**Anti-radiation Tabs:** Good for what ails you, if you've been exposed to hard radiation. The kit includes five tablets, each staving off the effects of exposure to such things as plasma engines or solar flares.

**Hull Sealant Spray-Gel:** A small tube of foul-smelling gel, it can be sprayed onto a hull breach. Enough is in each tube to cover twenty or so small (10 sq. cm) punctures.

Be wary of any ship where you see most of the crew carrying a full kit all of the time, or where these kits cannot be located.

#### **Jump Pack**

Personal flight and anti-grav devices are something of a rarity in the Imperium, however, far from unknown. Jump packs are one such system, allowing limited powered flight using a combination of suspensor systems and thrusters. Jump packs are commonly employed by elite forces such as the Adeptus Sororitias Seraphim and the Imperial Navy's void armsmen, while a much more powerful version is also used by Space Marine assault forces.

Jump packs require the operator to have the Pilot (Jump Pack) skill. A standard (basic) jump pack allows for a safe, guided fall from any height and, with a thruster boost, make an unlimited series of short jumps (landing at the end of each Round's movement), or they can duplicate the Flyer (12) trait for up to about a minute at a time. A jump pack's power supply will last for about an hour of strenuous operation before it needs replacing.

#### **Magboots**

Heavy and bulky, these oversized shoes contain electromagnets, which when activated, means the user can adhere to metallic surfaces such as exterior hull plating. Walking in them takes some effort, but they allow for a much easier time when working outside a ship or in areas where grav plating has failed. Magboots reduce the wearer's Movement and AB by half (round up) but allow him to move about normally in areas of low or no gravity as long as there is a suitable surface to walk on.

#### **The Imperial Navy in Sector Calixis**

Operating throughout the sector is the might of the Imperial Navy, but even with their multitude of warships, they are stretched thinly. Despite any full scale battles underway, there are always smaller outbreaks that must be contained, especially when a renegade governor attempts to declare independence and cordon off his planet or system. The predations of xenos raiders tax their resources with hit-and-run engagements as well.

In addition to its actions in ship combat, the Navy is also responsible for transporting Imperial Guard regiments to war zones. If a commercial fleet is important enough (or has the right connections at the Lucid Palace) then Naval vessels can be assigned escort duty, especially if a trade route has been heavily hit by pirates.

Battlefleet Calixis is the largest and most powerful fleet in the sector, but is rarely brought together as a single force. More often it is split up to meet demands as they arise.

#### **Melta Gel**

This term covers a wide variety of extruded gelatine similar to dental paste, usually bright red or some other strong colour and sticky enough to adhere to most surfaces. Once applied and activated by an electric spark, it rapidly burns through bulkhead plating without the need for oxygen. Ideal for opening up a spacecraft from the outside or working in areas where air has escaped, most repair crews carry several tubes in their kits. A tube of melta gel can cover five metres in a thin line, or a surface area of one metre square. Along this line or area it deals Damage as a melta bomb over the course of about a minute as it burns through whatever it is applied to before becoming inert.

#### **Ploin Juice**

A common non-alcoholic beverage popular with many ship's crews as it combats many common illnesses brought on by the habitual poor diets most find in space travel. Made from the lopsided ploin fruit, it is rich in many vitamins and has an extended shelf life. It can be added to most poor quality distillations to add much-needed flavour, or even used as the basis for its own strong drink commonly known as "wobble" (as this is both what the fruit does when set upright, and what most users do after imbibing a few shots).

#### **Selenite Pattern Heavy Duty**

#### **Void Suit**

A truly ancient design and a relic of the sacred STC, the Selenite pattern is perhaps the most common heavy void suit used in the Imperium. Intended for use by voidwalkers, belt miners and the like, the suit's insulated ceramic-fibre weave provides much better protection than a simple sealed suit from the hazards of space such as temperature extremes, radiation and micro-fragment impact. Widely fabricated and hugely durable, some Selenite suits are treasured relics of the void born families and star vessels, and may have served many generations in a particular ship's crew.

The Selenite can sustain life in hard vacuum for up to ten hours before the dual re-breather cells of its life support system must be replaced (which may even be done without removing the suit). A fully functioning suit in good order also contains an internal vox-link, a seal patching kit, a compact grapnel/clasp plus ten metres of line, and a photo-visor. The suit's reinforced structure provides 3 Armour Points to the Body, Arms and Legs and 4 Armour Points from the helmet to the Head. The suit however is quite bulky and imposes a –10 penalty on all Agility Tests whilst worn. Selenite suits appear in several local variants and are subject to the rules for Armour Quality.

Some Selenite suits are fitted with impellor units, allowing the wearer to propel themselves through open space in zero or reduced gravity conditions with a Movement of 6 (they are not powerful enough to use in a normal gravity environment, however).

#### **Void Rounds**

Specialised void rounds can be created by using selfigniting chemicals such that the weapon can be used in void environments without the risk of misfiring or rapid overheating.

Weapons using void rounds gain the Reliable quality in void conditions.

**Available For:** SP weapons (all).

The Black Holds

*"Lieutenant Weems, inform the cogboys the power is still out in section 52. Still no sign of the repair team. Sir, can we confirm this was their last location? Lads, watch your footing, grav plating seems low. Opening shaft 52-Beta now… hey, what's that?"*

— Recorded Vox Transmission, Ensign Patel Carolis,

Chartist vessel *Steadfast Faith*.

<span id="page-166-0"></span>As with many Imperial artefacts, most spacecraft have lifespans measured in dozens of centuries or longer. This is especially true for the truly gigantic vessels such as Chartist Greatholds or Naval capital ships. As generations pass, even regular repair and watchful maintenance leave some areas falling into disuse as decks become sealed off and entire subsections are abandoned. They become a dark home to the unwanted and forgotten, renegades and runaways. These are the "nightmare holds", the black decks only whispered of throughout the many fleets in the sector but known to all that make their lives in the void. The Black Holds

In these miserable places entire biospheres have formed, despite lack of power, fresh air or even reliable footing where grav plating has failed. Flickering lights barely illuminate the dank and toxic environs where fungus and beasts thrive amidst the chemical and radioactive sludge. Unknown numbers of what were once men also congregate here to survive. Even mediumsized ships contain hundreds if not thousands of indentured workers and others pressed into service, and escaping from their A

oppression is a constant goal. Once free, though, many wish they stayed in the dregs of their prior station. Other habitants can include fleeing criminals, newly emerging mutants and renegades. After years in the holds, most devolve into barely human dregs as the hostile atmosphere twists them unkindly. Now they lurk as bilge-scum, flesh eating hold-gaunts and other unholy creatures, attacking any who venture into their lairs. When desperate enough they venture topsides in search of food, and woe unto anyone they find.

#### **Gear of the Bilge-Scum**

In these conditions, it is rare for regular weapons to be common, as lack of ammunition quickly becomes an issue. Instead most are crafted from the debris littered throughout the black decks, creating a wide range of primitive weapons often made of high-tech materials. Crude swords, axes and shields are the most common. While simplistic in design, they can be just as deadly as the more advanced weapons these creatures face in combat.

#### <span id="page-167-0"></span>**Ghiliam**

Whether outcast, victim or fugitive, to join the Ghiliam (as the void born call them) is to leave humanity forever, descending to depths from which there is no return. Haunting the dark spaces and abandoned holds of great vessels, these debased, insane mutants and carrion eaters subsist on whatever meat they can find and aren't too picky as to how they get it. Treated as dangerous and clever vermin, they are exterminated mercilessly where possible.

#### **Bilge Grenade**

These are generally crude bombs containing a mix of poisonous fungi, chemical waste, and diseased flesh. The canisters burst open on impact, showering the area with caustic sludge and noxious vapours. While their effect is not very powerful, unprotected targets can be brought down by the toxins, if not by the sheer nauseating smell of the attack. Bilge grenades count as frag grenades with the Unreliable and Toxic qualities. Gear of the Bilge Scum

#### **Lumenmould**

This phosphorescent fungus provides reliable lighting for most of the Black Holds, where it thrives in the toxic sludge lining most decks. By scraping the mould and sludge into clear containers, crude light sources can be created to offer this greenish-yellow glow in areas without other sources of illumination. Others simply use the slime as body paint, making their already unsettling forms even more terrifying. A patch of lumenmould lights an area dimly for five metres.

### **Crime in the Void**

Despite its reputation as one of the more civilized sectors in the segmentum, Calixis does support a thriving underclass

V: Frontier Worlds & The Void

of criminal activity. The mostly uncharted Halo Stars host numerous pirate bands for example, but most illegal interstellar activities riddle the sector's interior like worms in an apple.

Petty smuggling is the most common of these as even the most loyal of captains may haul some extra unregistered goods at a tidy profit. Almost every transport ship, especially short-range models, has concealed cargo spaces just for this purpose. Crime in the Void

Merchant vessels operating without the proper charter for their area or trade route do so at peril, both from the Navy as well as rival Chartist fleets who swiftly act to destroy any competitors. They are welcomed in some systems though as a way to bypass the frequently oppressive monopolies maintained by some Chartist traders.

Then there are clear-cut smuggling outfits, often using counterfeit licenses to move merchandise from system to system. Some of these also transport people fleeing the Emperor's Law, no questions asked. Largescale smuggling operations normally use rendezvous locations on the periphery of a system to do business, far from watchful eyes. Smaller system ships then ferry the goods to waiting purchasers.

Some areas of space are off-limits except only to those operating with Imperial sanction. These can be areas such as unexplored systems licensed exclusively to Rogue Traders, or quarantine zones of xenos activity. Operating in such an area without remit is highly illegal, but can often lead to incredible profits that are well worth the risk. Blockade runners operate these areas, relying on stealth and speed to escape capture as they dart in and out of forbidden space with prohibited cargo.

# Navis Nobilite & Navigators

Like any other civilized sector of Imperial space, Calixis has several families of the Navis Nobilite operating to ensure spacecraft can successfully travel long distances through the void. There are three major Navigator Houses in the sector: Houses Banetek, Gazmati and Term'L. All three have major holdings on Scintilla in Hive Sibellus as well as Hive Tarsus. As with most Navigator Houses, there are fierce rivalries between each of them and they are constantly struggling for dominance. Banetek and Gazmati have operated in Calixis the longest, being part of the initial explorations and conquests lead by Lord Angevin long ago, with Term'L more recently extending into this sector.

Each house operates a sizable fleet with a large mercantile division under Hereditary Charters. They conduct standard trading throughout the sector as well as providing specialised transport for their own house members. Many of their vessels are ancient even by Imperial standards, passed down through many generations of these longlived beings. They also control many of the prime trading routes in the sector.
