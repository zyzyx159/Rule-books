### Chapter VII: The Holy Ordos 
*"There exist out there in the unbroached void of night and in the deeper darkness beyond, things so terrible and vile that they would devour us and destroy everything we have made. And why? Because they fear us—and rightly so, for we are humanity and the stars are ours."*

— Lord Solar Macharius, *On the Eve of the Macharian Crusade*.

Rather than detailing the kind of specialised weapons and gear you might find on a particular world, this chapter illustrates some of the unique tools of the Holy Ordos of the Inquisition itself. The Calixian Conclave and its agents span the sector from the imposing bulk of the Tricorn R

Palace on Scintilla to lonely fortress stations and hidden watchposts on scores of worlds. The tools of the Inquisition and its agents are similarly diverse. The Holy Ordos thrives on adaptability and demands it from its servants, and an Acolyte that cannot make do with what they have to hand isn't worthy of the title. This having been said, there are certain tasks that the Holy Ordos must undertake and enemies they must face that demand more "unique" responses and solutions than most people can imagine. In answer to this, over the years the Calixian Conclave has built up is own specialised arsenal of strange weapons and bizarre devices to meet the xenos, the Daemon and the heretic head-on if needs be, and it is these mysterious and often savage artefacts you will find here.

Most of the items listed in this chapter are singular and rare creations, and available only from sources either within the Holy Ordos itself or contacts among high-ranking members of one of the Adepta. Base prices and Availability are still listed for these, but these should be viewed as measures of how common these items are and what kind of value is placed on them by those that create them, and rather than simply stumping up cash to the amount given, some other task, favour or boon of like value might be asked instead.

#### **Catechist Pattern Stake-Crossbow**

#### **Class:** Basic (Primitive)

An usual weapon to say the least, the Catechist-pattern is a high-power, self-loading mechanical crossbow weapon designed not to fire regular crossbow bolts but rather specially constructed 15 centimetre adamantine-silver alloy stakes. These stakes, as well as being diamantine-tipped and fired with sufficient force to pierce body armour, are microetched with deadly prayers of anathema against the witch and the Daemon and feature razor barbs that snap out from the stake to embed in the target's flesh.

The special stake-bolts fired by the Catechist count as "holy" weapons, and so many have a particular effect on certain warp creatures (as will be noted in their description) and count as having the Tearing effect when used against targets with a Psy Rating or Sorcery. If more than 5 points of Damage are dealt after Armour and Toughness Bonus, the bolt becomes embedded in the victim. Removing the bolt by force deals an additional 1d5 points of Damage ignoring Armour and Toughness Bonus.

Stake-bolts for the Catechist can only be acquired through the Holy Ordos itself, for the purposes of getting hold of them they have a base price of 50 Thrones each and Rare Availability.

#### **Sacristan Bolt Pistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

This class of bolt pistol is produced under secret license for the Ordos Calixis by the Fane of Orthlack on Scintilla, and is based on the ancient and venerated Godwyn-De'az patterns used by Adepta Sororitas. Although bolt pistols are both relatively rare and expensive to maintain, their great killing power is extremely valued, and the Sacristan, branded and sealed with the symbol of the Holy Ordos itself, is the chosen sidearm of many Inquisitors and senior Acolytes alike who see it as a mark of rank.

Unless the firer has a Strength Bonus of 4 or more, the Sacristan imposes a –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests due to its massive size and recoil.

#### **Eviscerator**

#### **Class:** Melee (Chain)

Favoured by Ecclesiarchy zealots and witch-hunters, the eviscerator is an obscenely large double-handed chain weapon fitted with a crude version of the disruption field generator more commonly found on power-blades. Although very unwieldy and tiring to use, the eviscerator is fully capable of ripping an armoured man in half or tearing open the most blasphemously corrupted mutant in a single stroke. Outside of the agents of the Holy Ordos, the Redemptionist sects that plague the lower levels of Hive Tarsus on Scintilla employ the eviscerator as a weapon of terror and corporal mortification.

Any character that rolls 96–00 on their attack roll while wielding an eviscerator risks losing control of the roaring chain blade and must succeed on an Agility Test or take Damage as if struck by the weapon (including the wielder's SB).

#### **Force Weapons**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Made from the rarest materials and interlaced with psychic reactive and channelling circuitry of a design said to have originated with the Emperor himself when he walked among mortal men, force weapons are capable of channelling the mental power and aggression of a psyker into deadly, realityrending force. It is theoretically possible to create force weapons in almost any form, and several unique and potent variants, such as the Nemesis weapons of the Grey Knights and the legendarily destructive Daemonhammers, exist. The three commonest types of force weapons are given here, the force sword, force axe and force staff.

Unless wielded by a psyker, force weapons simply count as a Good Craftsmanship Mono variant of their standard Primitive weapon type (see pages 128 and 142 of Dark Heresy). However, in the hands of a wielder with a Psy Rating, they are much more. For every point of Psy Rating the wielder has, the weapon's Damage and Penetration increases by +1. For example, a force sword wielded by a character with Psy Rating 3 would inflict 1d10+3 R (plus SB) and have a Penetration of 5.

In addition to normal Damage, whenever a psyker damages an opponent, he or she may, as a Free Action, channel psychic force and killing will into the blade. Treat this effect as a power with a Threshold 6. On a success, the wielder and victim make Opposed Willpower Tests. For every degree of success, the force weapon's wielder deals an additional 1d10 points of Damage ignoring the victim's Armour and Toughness Bonus.

Force weapons cannot be destroyed by a power weapon's field.

A force staff also acts as a Psy-Focus (see page 151 of Dark Heresy).

#### **Witch Lance**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

A potent weapon that is a mix of the techno-arcane and the sacred, the Witch Lance, sometimes also known as a "power stake" or "excoriator" is designed to destroy rogue psykers and witches utterly and without mercy. A heavily modified power weapon taking the form of a metre and a half long spear or stake of cold iron and adamantine, it contains at its heart a pressure-release reservoir of concentrated promethium mixed with sacred oils and anti-psy compounds. Should the lance successfully impale the victim's body this mixture is explosively vented, consuming the victim utterly in a blast of holy fire.

Whenever Righteous Fury results while fighting with a witch lance, the weapon deals an additional 2d10 E Holy Damage and sets the victim on fire in lieu of the normal results of Righteous Fury.

#### **The Blades of Inquisitor Herrod**

A renowned member of the Calixian Conclave for nearly two centuries, Inquisitor Herrod famously owned a pair of anointed Lathe-sabres and acquired a skill for using them that made him one of the most feared swordsmen of his time. Forged in the high Imperial style, these long, louche sabres sent countless heretics and unclean beasts to their deaths. Herrod himself was an infamous duellist, ready to avenge any slight with blood—even one made by a fellow Inquisitor. Herrod habitually bore one of the blades himself, while the second was carried by his foremost Acolyte during his apprenticeship as a mark of honour. On the nine occasions during his career that Herrod officially sponsored one of his charges to full Inquisitorial rank, he presented them with a Lathe-blade of their own, never a copy of his but each a unique design that "best suited their true character". Seventy years ago, Herrod and his ship disappeared without trace while pursuing a horrific warp cult known as the Vile Savants deep into the Halo Stars, but tales of the flamboyant Herrod and his gifts live on, not least because Herrod's blades are now borne by several of the sector's most renowned Inquisitors.

<span id="page-189-0"></span>*"Daemon I name thee! By the writ Holy Ordos of the Inquisition I abjure thee! By silver and sacred fire I burn thee! With the armour of my contempt I mock thee! Perish in the formless pit of nightmare that spawned thee! In the name of the Emperor, Daemon I cast thee out!"* — Inquisitor-Exorcist Harkness, Ordo Malleus.

#### **Hexagramatic Wards**

Powerful wards, null-psy lattice circuits and prayers of protection are woven into armour carrying this upgrade, often visually represented by ornate carvings and graven icons embellishing its surface. Armour upgraded in this way serves not only to protect the wearer's body but also their soul.

Armour with this upgrade provides it wearer with a +20 bonus on Tests made to resist any direct psychic attack or manipulation used against them. Additionally, the armour provides double the Armour Points against attacks of psychic force or warpenergy that directly deal Damage (such as the Psychic Blade or Fire Bolt powers), and keeps its value against attacks made with the Warp Weapon effect.

**Upgrades:** Carapace breastplate, full carapace armour and power armour.

#### **Rosarius**

A protective device granted to senior members of the Ecclesiarchy's chamber militant and most zealous battlefield preachers, this traditional badge of faith also incorporates a powerful conversion field generator to shield its wearer from harm. Because of their close ecumenical ties to the priesthood, Inquisitors and agents of the Ordo Hereticus are often found in possession of Rosarius and depend on their almost miraculous powers to fend off harm.

The Rosarius' conversion field is generated some distance away from the wearer and so has no effect against blows struck in close combat. Roll 2d10 and reduce the Damage caused from ranged attacks by this amount. If "11" is rolled, the attack has slipped through the field completely and the Damage is not reduced at all. If "00" is rolled, the Damage is reduced by 20 but the Rosarius has been temporarily overloaded and may not be used for another 1d10 Rounds. If the Rosarius overloads, roll an additional 1d10. If this rolls a "9" the generator has failed and it may not be used again until repaired.

Additionally, as this is a conversion field system and works in part by transforming incoming energy into radiant light, if the field blocks more than 12 points of Damage from any single attack, the blast of light released is the equivalent to the effects of a photon flash grenade centred on the wearer (see page 137 of Dark Heresy).

#### **The Tetragon Facility**

Aside from it "public" face in the form of the Tricorn Palace on Scintilla and its fortresses on other worlds, the Inquisition has numerous other holdings whose names and natures are secret even to its own. The Tetragon Facility is one such locale. An echoing cold space station whose origin and original purpose are lost to silent history, it now serves the Tyrantine Cabal. Empty and dead save when it is in use, the Tetragon is comprised of data-looms and stack archives, forensic bays and sensor auguries, it has staterooms for scores and barracks for a thousand and cells for thousands more. Its function is to go wherever it is needed, towed into position by the leviathan-power of Mechanicus Highliners to serve as a forward base to observe the aftermath of Komus's visitations and mark the passage of the Tyrant Star. Once all that can be learned has been learned, the concentrated data is rendered down and transferred to the Bastion Serpentis, the Tetragon is purged and falls silent once more until it is needed again. Rumours persist though that other shadowy forces within the Ordos still use the Tetragon in the long, cold dark between visitations for purposes of their own, for inquiries, for trials and experiments perhaps, things they cannot afford even their brethren to know…

*"You think you can be an Inquisitor just because you've the courage to kill? Ha! Wisdom is a more terrible weapon than bravery, or hate, or even love.

— Inquisitor Herrod.

#### **Blessed Ammunition and Sanctified Weapons**

The prayers and blessing of those of true faith in the God-Emperor of Mankind, coupled with the ancient lore of Ecclesiastical alchemistry, is able to turn mere mundane bullets and blades into weapons that are capable of harming the foul denizens of the warp and other such unnatural horrors.

The sole effect of these upgrades is to make the Damage caused by the weapon in question counted as "Holy", which has certain effects on some Daemonic and warp creatures (as will be noted in their description). Obtaining such items is only possible through the Holy Ordos or high-ranking members of the Ecclesiarchy, and the cost and rarity shown reflects this.

Blessed Ammunition is used with: Bolt Weapons, Flamers, and Solid Projectile Weapons.

**Sanctified Weapon Upgrades:** Any Primitive weapon (including Mono upgraded weapons) or Chain weapon of at least Good quality craftsmanship.

#### **Null Box**

Occasionally vital for preserving or safely containing a sample or woeful artefact, null boxes are portable stasis field generators in the shape of small armoured boxes, although some go right up to the size of a large chest or sarcophagus. Inside a stasis field, all time and motion halts and whatever is trapped inside is effectively frozen and removed from any interaction with reality—essentially contained in a psychic dead zone. True relics of the Dark Age of Technology, most null boxes are extraordinarily resilient and tough (almost supernaturally so, which may be the result of the time-control field within) and once active require no further power unless deactivated and turned on again. For obvious reasons the control mechanisms of most null boxes are often hidden and heavily encrypted. Unless breached with enormous force or simply turned off by someone able to do so, a null box and its contents can out-sit eternity if needs be.

#### **Psy-Jammer**

Somewhat esoteric examples of techno-arcana, these devices can at least partially disrupt psychic energy and offer some degree of protection against the dark arts of the psyker and the witch. Expensive and rare, their use is largely restricted to the agents of the Holy Ordos, the Mechanicus itself and those among the Imperium's elites whose paranoia often matches their vast wealth. Much more powerful examples of anti-psy technology do exist but they have a tendency to be exceeding rare and often unique.

Psy-jammers can be obtained in two types: a protective amulet and a cranial implant. The amulet has the disadvantage that it can be physically removed; but while the implant cannot be so easily countered, it can have unpleasant long-term side effects to the user.

A psy-jammer grants its wearer a +20 bonus on any Test involved to resist the effects of a Psychic Power and +10 bonus

#### **The Blasphemy of Erya Nephthys**

Perhaps the greatest foe any Inquisitor fears to face is one of their own number turned renegade. The sealed and proscribed annals of Imperial history accounts the dark paths of some whose very names have become bywords of treachery and destruction, but for the Calixian Conclave, there is no renegade in living memory more reviled than Erya Nephthys. Renowned as a dogmatic Monodominant within Ordo Hereticus, beneath Erya's façade shadows grew and festered in her heart: she had become utterly and secretly obsessed with her own survival at all costs. Wounded many times over her career, she had lost an arm to a Daemon on Sinophia, been resuscitated twice and had to spend a full year convalescing after terrible events on the ill-famed world of Dusk. It was this last horror that drove her over the edge.

Secretly for years she had bent her efforts to pursuing those like her—obsessed with death and immortality. She hunted down necro-cults and heretek vivisectors, destroyed them and keeping their secrets for herself to conduct blasphemous sorceries to conquer the grave. After an armed raid on the Genators of the Hippocrasian Agglomeration, she sparked a schism between the Mechanicus and the Holy Ordos that threatened outright conflict. Recalled to the Tricorn Palace on Scintilla to explain her actions, when she did return it was no more than a ruse, and using terrible and unguessed at sorceries and forbidden sciences, she struck, slaying several Inquisitors and scores of Acolytes before stealing several artefacts from the deep vaults and making her escape.

In response, the wrath of the Ordos was terrible to behold and, united in grief for the fallen and outrage at Erya's crime, it acted with single and terrible purpose. The pursuit lasted for fifteen years and left no stone unturned, regardless of the consequences. Erya and her agents were hounded from the Scarus Drift to the far side of the Hazeroth Abyss, and as she died for a final time, burning in the blaze of Witch Finder Rykehuss's inferno pistol, she swore she would yet rise again to avenge herself on the living. Her ashes now remain in a sealed vault in the depths of the Tricorn Palace.

on Tests to resist possession attacks. The jammer, however, has no effect on psychic attacks that inflict direct physical Damage.

Psykers cannot use psy-jammers (they naturally overload them).

#### **Psy-T racke r**

Sometimes referred to as aetherscopes, these are a particular form of scanner designed to monitor disturbances in the empyrean and detect and analyse psychic energies. These sophisticated and tricky devices are used extensively by adepts and savants attached to the Holy Ordos, although very similar scanners are actually used as a common part of the engineering equipment of major starships to monitor the status of the ship's Geller field and its generators.

The Tech Use skill is required to be able use one of these scanners. Awareness Tests taken in conjunction with the device enable the user to determine the presence and relative strength of psychic force, Daemons, the lingering effects of warp disturbances and the like. Psy-trackers are somewhat temperamental devices with an operating range of no more than a few hundred metres (although they might register very powerful spikes and signals from far beyond that). They are also easily clouded and confused by powerful energy fields and psychic "background noise".

#### **Psycannon Bolts**

A true psycannon is a highly advanced form of bolter weapon utilised by the legendary Grey Knights, and aside from their armouries and a few powerful members of the Ordo Malleus, it is extremely rare even among the ranks of the Inquisition. Psycannon bolts, however, utilise the same core of psy-anthaemic substance in their construction and are capable of ripping through warp-stuff and barriers of psychic force with ease. Shockingly fatal even to those without psychic powers, it is whispered by some that those slain by psycannon bolts have their souls snuffed out like guttering candles.

Psycannon bolts add +5 to all Critical Damage inflicted. Psycannon bolts inflict double their rolled Damage against targets with a Psy Rating, Daemons and other warp entities after Armour and Toughness Bonuses are taken into account. Damage inflicted by psycannon bolts is classed as Holy and ignores any psychically or warp-generated armour or protective field (such as Daemonic Resilience, Telekinetic Shield, etc).

Psycannon bolts are only ever obtainable from somebody with full Inquisitorial rank.

**Used with:** Bolt weapons.

*"All one has to do is look upon the face of the alien to know we are right. That every hatred and prejudice, every spite and fury that has coiled in man's heart since time began was put there for this single sacred purpose—to hate them and bring them death!"*

— Lord Inquisitor Nihilus, Collected Sermons of Monodominance Vol I, Part XI.

#### **The Calixian Black Grimoire**

Thought to have been first penned by the Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Lord Quate'maz Knael in the in the aftermath of his expeditions into the Hazeroth Abyss, and substantially added to a century later by the infamous Inquisitor Kol Shek, the Black Grimoire is no less than a field manual detailing many forms of xenos creatures they had encountered in their long years of service—explaining how to identify, combat

and destroy them. Kol Shek's numerous later entries, often considerably briefer and laid down in his distinctive and somewhat sensationalistic prose style, widen the work's scope to include xenophile cults, warp entities and a host of other unconnected horrors. The very existence of the Grimoire is a point of contention among the Calixian Conclave as most in the Ordo Malleus feel that such information should never leave the heavily guarded libraries of the Ordos, while more Puritan factions of the Hereticus claim that the work is far too dangerous to be allowed to exist at all, and all copies should be hunted down and purged (although this might have something to do with the somewhat disparaging remarks that Kol Shek makes about the witch hunters throughout).

The Grimoire takes the shape of a small black data-slate made of high-impact polyflex that opens in the fashion of a clasped book and also has a short-range audio and pict recording and a playback function. Their owners, in addition to numerous other safeties built into them, personally encrypt all copies of the Black Grimoire and the Grimoire self-immolates if opened by an individual not specified by its gene-lock, or if tampered with.

The Black Grimoire provides a +10 bonus on Research Tests involving Ciphers (Occult), Scholastic Lore (Legend) and Forbidden Lore (Cults, Daemonology, Warp and/or Xenos).

#### **Cherubim**

The bio-constructs known as Cherubim are of uncertain origin, but they are one of the few permitted examples of such biosculpted homunculi allowed within the Imperium. Taking the form most commonly resembling that of somewhat corpulent and unwholesome looking genderless children, they are also often implanted with augmetic feathery wings (and a grav generator) allowing limited flight. Cherubim are not truly alive at all and their synthesised, bloodless and waxen flesh needs neither to eat nor sleep and is fed from their internal power-cell. They are controlled by an augmented cortex and nervous system usually harvested from some lesser creature such as a simian, bird, swine or felid, and implanted with a set of programmed commands that allows them to perform some simple task such as copying text, fetching and carrying small items or tirelessly singing the Emperor's praises with augmetic vocal cords.

Outside the rarefied noble houses and Imperial hierarchy (most notably the Ecclesiarchy) where they are used, most citizens view Cherubim with a degree of distaste and superstitious fear. This is not entirely without cause as it is a matter of record that in rare instances Cherubim have been known to "devolve" allowing some corrupted and mangled version of their organic cortex to take over their behaviour with unpleasant consequences.

**Commands:** Cherubim can be commanded as per a cyberfamiliar (see [page 142\).](#page-142-0) In addition it may be given orders to carry out any pre-programmed tasks it understands (i.e. "lay out my vestments", "copy that tract", "hold aloft the prayer scroll", etc.)

**Programmed Instinct:** Cherubim will not attack or engage in violence unless specifically ordered to so. They flee if injured or startled, and left to their own devices they are indolent creatures, often perching in high places and simply watching until called for or set a task. Some might even regard them as sly, and stories flourish in noble households and churches of them filching small shiny objects and hiding them in the rafters.

#### **Drusine Incense**

Said to be rendered from a proscription laid down by the warrior-saint Drusus himself during the war-torn days of the Angevin Crusade, this incense—a mixture of myrrh, camphor, verdigris and the crushed blossoms of the rare Iocathine rose—is prepared ritually in the vaults of the Cathedral of Illumination in Hive Tarsus and is renowned for its powerful purifying effect. Highly valued by the faithful, Drusine incense is used in high masses and ceremonies of import across the Calixis Sector, and the Holy Ordos know that folk tales of the incense's ability to ward-off evil hold more than a grain of truth.

Drusine incense is a coarse reddish-gold crystalline powder burned in a self-heating metal censer suspended on chains called a thurible. The incense burned and dispersed in this creates a cloud up to three metres across. Within this cloud, characters with 10 or less Corruption Points are immune to the effects of the Daemonic Presence special rule. A single portion of incense burns for 1d10+20 minutes.

#### **Excruciator**

The contrary to popular reputation, the Inquisition frowns on crude physical coercion and torture, finding information extracted by such methods to be ultimately flawed and utterly unreliable, not to mention often entirely inadequate against those whose minds and bodies have been given over to dark forces. However, when direct interrogation is called for in extremis and more thorough methods (such as psychic probing) are unavailable, devices that induce mental discomfort, terror and illusory agonies though neural and chemical manipulation without uneedful injury are employed. The most common (and mobile) of these devices are known as excruciators, and consist of a variety of long monofilament induction needles and auto injectors linked to a control unit and a specially modified medicae auspex.

Using such a device requires a about an hour to set up on a subject (who must be restrained) and can only be employed by a character with both the Medicae and Tech-Use skills. The use of an excruciator adds a +20 bonus to Interrogation Tests for the questioner and a -10 penalty to Deceive Tests for the subject.

Individuals with the Fearless talent or From Beyond trait are immune to this device's effects.

#### **Icon of Holy Wrath**

There usually comes a time even in the most labyrinthine covert investigation, or ongoing deception by the Inquisition, when the facts have been gathered and the guilty identified. A time to punish and purify with all the awesome might and magisterial fury the Holy Ordos can muster. It is at these times that the Icon of Holy Wrath is displayed. Each icon differs, based on the traditions and tastes of the Inquisitors that own them. For some it will be an unfurled banner depicting the avenging visage of the Emperor himself, for others a sainted reliquary of martyr's bones or even the simple uncompromising symbol of the Ordos itself held aloft in a suspensor field. Not all Inquisitors use these icons but those that do either carry them into battle themselves or entrust them to a prominent Acolyte to carry in the forefront of battle as a sign to the corrupt and the fallen that their judgement is at hand.

The presence of the Icon of Holy Wrath enhances the character's visibility for the purpose of certain talents (Into the Jaws of Hell, for example). Additionally they give the bearer and their allies within six metres a rating of Fear (1 Disturbing), to cultists, mutants, heretics and anybody else the GM deems appropriate.

These icons cannot be bought, only fashioned appropriately by a full Inquisitor, and their use granted for a particular battle.

#### **Torpor**

Long used by the masters of the Black Ships to control their harvest of charges, torpor is a chemical cocktail of neural-inhibitors and narcotics deigned to render the subject docile and, more importantly, negate their ability to use Psychic Powers. Likewise the Holy Ordos maintains it own supplies of Torpor for prisoner control and other uses, while hereteks and some cults have been known to manufacture their somewhat unreliable version for their own dark purposes.

A single dose of torpor lasts for 1d10 minus the subject's Toughness Bonus in hours, during which time the subject is overcome by a grey anxiety-ridded haze in which he counts as Fatigued and must succeed in a Difficult (–20) Willpower Test to perform any Actions of his own volition. In addition, psychic characters have their Psy-Rating reduced by 4 while under this drug's effects.
