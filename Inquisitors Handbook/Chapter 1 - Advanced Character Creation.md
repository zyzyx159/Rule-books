# Chapter I: Advanced Character Creation
"It matters not where you came from, nor why you were selected. It matters only that you serve."

— Inquisitor Serephus XII.

Dark Heresy provides a solid foundation on which players can create interesting and unique characters. However, the options provided in the core rule book are just a sampling of the many and varied servants of the Inquisition. People of all walks, all occupations can come to find themselves recruited and working for the monolithic Inquisition, tearing back the facade of the Imperium to search for and destroy corruption, xenos threat and anything else that threatens the worlds of the God-Emperor. This chapter expands on the information in Dark Heresy by offering new home worlds, character origins and detailed backgrounds for Acolytes.

# Origins
All characters must come from somewhere. Before their recruitment, they had lives and dreams. They had a place and a people, a history that has shaped their personalities and ambitions, as well as providing that first spark that drew the steely gaze of the Inquisitor. Home Worlds encapsulate a large part of a character's history, describing the sort of culture that produced the Acolyte, while also helping to define the character's nature and appearance. 

The following new Home Worlds offer a mix of new world types as well as signature events and upbringings that have had as deep and profound an impact on your character as being born on a particular type of world. These new Origins are treated in exactly the same way as Home Worlds. You can use Table 1-1: Random Home World/Origin to replace Table 1–1:Random Home World in Dark Heresy.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01–15 | **Feral World:** Feral worlders are born to worlds trapped in a state of barbarism. They are natural survivors, and are commonly big, strong and tough. Feral worlders make for characters that are exceptional at physical action and combat.                                                                                       |
| 16–35 | **Hive World:** Hivers are the products of vast a crowded hive cities. They are fast talking, quick thinking individuals accustomed to looking out for themselves—perfect if you want to play a roguish character who lives by their wits.                                                                                           |
| 36–55 | **Imperial World:** Much of humanity hails from one of the myriad civilized worlds of the Imperium, where, despite bewildering diversity, Imperial culture and faith in the God-Emperor is strong. Adaptable and varied, characters with this Origin make good all-rounders and have the widest choice of careers available to them. |
| 56–65 | **Void Born:** Born from the bloodlines of human star travellers, voiders have lived most of their lives in space within the metallic bastions of great vessels. Uncommonly lucky and strong willed, they are perfect if you want to play a psyker or risk-taking adventurer.                                                        |
| 66–75 | **Forge World:** Those raised in the shadow of the Omnissiah have survived the Machine God's harsh regime and possesses an innate familiarity with the higher mysteries of arcane science, making for excellent scholars and tech-priests.                                                                                           |
| 76–85 | **Schola Progenium:** Progena are orphans of Imperial servants trained in mind, body and spirit from birth. They make for superior warriors and knowledgeable leaders, if lacking in experience of life's more sordid side.                                                                                                          |
| 86–95 | **Noble Born:** Nobles are privileged individuals, raised in wealth and steeped in tradition and etiquette. They are ideally suited for those who prefer charm and guile over brute force. Nobles make superb spies, diplomats and assassins.                                                                                        |
| 96–00 | **Mind Cleansed:** Those whose minds have been emptied of identity and their memories wiped or sealed off. These rare individuals have been "re-made" by their Inquisitorial masters to serve the Holy Ordos.                                                                                                                        |

## Forge Worlds
*"You were born in the shadow of the Omnissiah and all your life you have been surrounded with the great wonders and dire terrors of the Machine God's arts. Ever since you were born you have been weighed, measured, codified and tested so that your masters might find your place in the great pattern; an unforgiving process that has fitted you well for survival and supremacy."*

— Explorator Archmagos Thule, address prior to the Helstrom Pursuit.

The domains of the Adeptus Mechanicus are many, from the ceaseless industry of the iron realms of the forge worlds, to labyrinthine orbitals and distant research outposts, to the nomadic and self-contained void caravans of the explorator fleets. They are an empire within and empire, distinct and yet interwoven with the fabric of the Imperium. Their masters are as ancient, wise, mysterious and cold as the machineries they tend.

### **Life on a Forge World**
Forge worlds are the beating iron heart of the Imperium and the sovereign domains of the Priesthood of Mars. They are given over to the demands of vast industrialization and eternally hungry for new resources to consume. A forge world's wheels never cease to turn and day-in-day-out for millennia, the reactors blaze and the foundries thunder, turning out refined materials and high technology to meet the Imperium's unending needs. A forge world is also far more than the sum of its continent spanning manufactorums; each is blessed with a higher level of technological advancement than the wider Imperium as a whole, and many arcane and strange wonders are common currency in their baroque labyrinths of ferrocrete and steel. They are also home to vast repositories of data, knowledge and lore, with as much as a third of any given forge world's entire infrastructure consisting of endless scriptoriums, mimetic vaults and knowledge dumps, tended in perpetuity by mindless drones and generations of archive adepts.

A forge world's undisputed masters are the Magos and Adepts of the Cult Mechanicus who rule with harsh precision and cold logic. To them the human population of their domains are little more than cogs and gears in the great machine, resources to be measured, graded and used to fit their worth. At their direction, the bulk of a forge world's human population is utilized as a skilled and trained labour force, while the brightest and best are inducted to the Adeptus Mechanicus itself. The more militant are chosen for the Skitarii Tech-Guard. Those deemed unworthy or irredeemable are fated to be "recycled" into servitor components, and indeed, servitors and drones often far outnumber a forge world's free willed population. Such is the price of failure.

Despite their mechanistic society and ceaseless industry, the life for the average citizen on a forge world is little harsher than on most hive worlds. Each forge world, regardless of its rigidly enforced order and the cold reason of its masters, is still home to very human ambition and apathy, vice and virtue. Indeed, the Mechanicus, with their cogitator-enhanced minds and iron logic, are still prone to factionalism and schism, often for reasons and causes quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Rivalries and feuds simmer between sects and individual Magos, each with their own devices and desires.

By far the largest and most important Mechanicus domains are the great forge worlds, such as the Lathe worlds of Calixis. This character Origin also covers those born and raised on the city-sized orbital stations, Mechanicus administered colonies (often called demesnes), research outposts and even in the forces of the restless explorator fleets, for the rites, rituals and beliefs of the Omnissiah also govern these places.

### **Forge Born PCs**
Forge worlds are not environments that reward, let alone tolerate, weakness in body or in mind. To have survived and prospered enough to leave a forge world's rigid society, your character must possess a great deal of drive, ambition and good fortune, or at the very least be bloody-minded and ruthless enough to have endured. You find yourself in a wider Imperial society that is at once familiar and strangely alien to you, where fools balk in superstition at technology without understanding its spiritual mysteries and purity of essence. Nor do they seem to understand mankind's survival demands power and, as the Omnissiah teaches, power is knowledge incarnate.

Common Lore (Tech) (Int) and Common Lore (Machine Cult) (Int) are Basic Skills for you.

### **Forge World Traits**
The children of the Omnissiah's domains gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Fit For Purpose**
A forge world inhabitant is repeatedly tested, channeled and trained from birth for their chosen station and role in life. Weakness is not tolerated and failure met with painful incentives to do better. Even those who follow a rogue's path must strive to be better than their peers to survive.

**Effect:** Depending on your chosen Career, increase your Characteristic by +3: Adept—Intelligence, Assassin— Agility, Guardsman—Ballistic Skill, Scum—Perception, or Tech-Priest—Willpower.

#### **Stranger to the Cult**
Although forge world born citizens know that the Emperor is their god and savior, they see the Imperial Creed through the lens of Cult Mechanicus doctrine. As a result, they can be surprisingly—and sometimes dangerously—ignorant of the common teachings and practices of the Ecclesiarchy, often failing to offer its clerics the level of deference they expect.

**Effect:** Forge world characters take a –10 penalty on Tests

involving knowledge of the Imperial Creed, and a –5 penalty on Fellowship Tests to interact with members of the Ecclesiarchy in formal settings.

#### **Credo Omnissiah**
Rather than being fully indoctrinated into the Imperial Cult, even the lowliest member of a forge world's society is brought up to venerate the spirits of the machine and to know and trust the basic rites of tech-propitiation.

**Effect:** You gain the Technical Knock talent.

### **Starting Wounds**
Forge world characters start with d5+7 Wounds.

### **Fate Points**
Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–5, you begin with 1 Fate Point; on a 6–9, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on a 10, you begin with 3 Fate Points.

### **The Past—Point of Origin**
Although the rites, beliefs and society of the Adeptus Mechanicus remain remarkably constant, not all characters are born in the same circumstances. Table 1-2: Point of Origin illustrates some possible points of origin and how they might affect your outlook.

| Roll  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–30 | **Greater Forge World:** Your character was raised in the shadows of one of the vast and powerful greater forges, such as the Lathe worlds of Calixis. You have felt the earth shake with the footfalls of Titans and basked in the fire-glow of kilometer-wide molten metal crucibles. Few spectacles impress you and the superiority of the Machine God is as evident in your mind as it is absolute. |
| 31–47 | **Minor Forge World:** You were born and trained on a minor forge world, either one yet to gain its majority or one where conditions were either particularly adverse or threatened. Hard experience has taught you the value of duty, unity and obedience and that the work of many is far harder to destroy than the work of one.                                                                     |
| 48–61 | **Orbital:** You hail from one of the Mechanicus's city-sized orbital stations and are accustomed to the miracles of contra-gravity, power fields and the mysteries of circuit and plasma. Each orbital serves a specialized task such as weapon smiting or crystal promulgation, and you value purity of purpose and mastery of skill above all else.                                                  |
| 62–74 | **Demesne:** A child of one of the Mechanicus's dominion worlds, you were singled-out and selected from your people at an early age for your potential and launched upon the path the Omnissiah has chosen for you. You have faith in your destiny and ability to overcome whatever is set against you; the weak perish and the superior survive.                                                       |
| 75–89 | **Research Outpost:** You spent your formative years serving on an isolated outpost scattered amongst the cold and unforgiving stars. You value single-minded pursuit of a goal above other considerations and you see dependence on the company of others as a weakness.                                                                                                                               |
| 90–00 | **Explorator Fleet:** Assigned at a young age to the forces of an Explorator Magos, you have traveled to distant and unknown stars and set foot upon worlds aeons dead. You have seen wonders and horrors few even suspect exist. Your encounters have left you craving always to know more, witness more and rip open the galaxy's secrets, one xenos body at a time if need be.                       |
### **Forge World Careers**

#### **Forge World Adepts**
Forge world Adepts toil among the gathered wisdom and incomprehensible minutia of the ages. Some consider themselves to be holy priests of knowledge, while for others the temptation to simply "know" becomes too much. For such driven and zealous individuals, data and its acquisition can become an addiction as dangerous and urgent as any drug, leading them to overstep the safe boundaries of ritual and clearance in search of ever more secret and obscure lore to the peril of life, sanity and soul.

#### **Forge World Assassins**
Subtle murder and infiltration are arts far from unknown in forge world politics. Bitter rivalries between individual Magos, demesne guild houses and opposing tech-sects can sometimes lead to outright data-theft, sabotage and bloodshed. The answer for some factions is to train and augment agents able to fulfill the roles of spy, saboteur and killer, and a few even sell their services for hire off-world.

#### **Forge World Guardsmen**
The regular armed forces of the Cult Mechanicus are the Skitarii Tech-Guard, raised as other worlds might form PDF units or regiments of the Imperial Guard. Selected and relentlessly trained to defend and enforce order on the forge worlds. Most will be part of a forge world's standing defenses or law enforcement, while others may serve in the retinues of individual Magos or allied guild houses.

#### **Forge World Scum**
Most forge world Scum are classed as heretics. A hidden underclass in the worker's slum-habs and abandoned buildings, they take what scraps of tech-lore they have managed to learn or steal and turn it to their own profit, often manufacturing illegal goods, drugs and arms from materials stolen from their erstwhile masters. All know that to be apprehended by the Mechanicus for their crimes often means a fate worse than death.

#### **Forge World Tech-Priests**
To be a tech-priest in a forge world is both a boon and a curse; it is to have access to the Machine God's greater glories but at the same time to be merely one among many; to be the least and most easily replaceable of the Omnissiah's servants. The society of tech-priests has a tendency to breed two polar groups; those who serve blindly and diligently and those who strive to overcome and advance themselves at any cost. For this latter division, flesh is merely weakness to be rid of, knowledge and power things to be coldly craved if the Machine God's mysteries are to be revealed and embraced.

## **Mind Cleansed**
*"I awoke in a bare, steel cell and knew not who I was. I asked the crimson-clad guards who took me, but they would not answer, nor would the chanting priest, the empty-eyed psyker or even the terrible lord in his gilded armor. Then my master placed a blade in my hand and I knew who I was, I was the Emperor's servant; I was death."*

— Sister Fayde, Sanctioned Inhumatrix.

There are things too dangerous to know, lives too heinous to continue and there are memories too terrible to bear, even for the strongest mind. In most of these cases, the answer as far as the Inquisition is concerned is simple: death, be it a well-deserved execution or the blessing of the Emperor's peace. But for a small number, a different solution is found—mental cleansing, a laborious and involved process sometimes known as mind-scrubbing or the "death of self ". Through a combination of psycho-viral, mimetic and telepathic intervention, the subject's memories are selectively erased and thought patterns altered. The resulting individual is then something of a blank slate to be rewritten, and in extreme cases entire new personalities and skills are imprinted directly into the mind.

The mind cleansed are effectively reborn and remade in the image of the Inquisition's desire, complete with whatever implanted skills or personality traits are required, perhaps along with a reconditioned physique and a new face to go with it. They may also (completely unbeknownst to them) be programmed with implanted memories of events and people that never were, or with deep-rooted mental commands they have no choice but to obey when the time comes.

This process, however, is not without cost or risk. Mind cleansed individuals are often left hollow and isolated figures, distrusted and forever set apart from others. Their patchwork memories and abused minds often leave them lacking empathy, cold-hatred and filled with a sense of loss or unnameable dread. Worse still in rare cases, some fragments of the old self or memories reassert themselves over time, causing a breakdown into madness or warranting further drastic "action" on the part of their masters.

A mind cleansed character has been kept alive for a reason, although they may not know and may never be told just what that reason is. They might have been selected by shear dint of survival, having endured terrible events or knowledge, and the Holy Ordos might have decided they were too useful to be wasted. Likewise, they might have been a loyal servant in the past or even an innocent victim or bystander of some horror, event or conspiracy that must remain secret. There may be darker motives though; perhaps the Inquisition has some use or hidden purpose for the individual that makes it expedient to keep them alive… for now.

### **Mind Cleansed PCs**
One day you awoke having been remade at the whim of another. Your mind is little more than a house filled with locked rooms that you cannot enter, and there are a thousand questions about yourself that you simply cannot answer. You cannot remember how you acquired or where you learned the knowledge and skills you possess. Sometimes you are shocked by the things you can do. You have a yawning emptiness inside you where others have memories of their past and, as a result, you feel separated from those around you, cast adrift in social situations as if they are happening to somebody else. The Inquisition's service is all you know, but you also know they do not really trust you—why should they? After all you don't trust yourself; for all you know you were once the very kind of monster you now hunt. The shadow in your mind is always there, lurking at the back of your mind, shapeless and formless, visible with horrible clarity for that split second when you awake screaming, only to melt away again to nothingness, like sand through your fingers.

### **Mind Cleansed Traits**
Thanks to their unique nature Mind Cleansed characters gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Engram Implantation**
With portions of the subjects' minds left more or less as blank slates waiting to be filled, their re-programmers often use egramatic induction to burn a variety of useful skill patterns directly into the Acolyte's cortex.

**Effect:** You begin play with Deceive (Fel) and Intimidate (S) skills. You treat Common Lore (Tech) (Int) and Survival (Int) as Basic Skills. You also begin with the Jaded and Pistol Weapon Training (SP and Las) talents.

#### **Fail safe Control**
All Mind Cleansed Inquisitorial agents have a fail safe command trigger implanted in their minds to prevent

#### **Imperial Conditioning**
Inquisition mind-scrubs are usually carried out to destroy selective memories but leave useful skills intact. Likewise the mind is often implanted with psychic barriers to prevent tampering, increase mental resilience and ensure loyalty.

**Effect:** You gain a +10 bonus on Willpower Tests made to resist Fear or attempts to control or possess your mind (psychically, chemically or otherwise).

#### **Through A Mirror Darkly**
The mind cleansing process has numerous side effects, including an eroding effect on the subject's sanity and unique dangers of its own for the character.

**Effect:** You start play with 1d5+2 Insanity Points. At the GMs discretion, certain rare events, individuals and even things like phrases, sights, and smells may trigger "repressed" memories roll on Table 1-3: Shards of Memory. When this occurs you must pass a Willpower Test or roll on the Shock Table (see page 233 in Dark Heresy)—note that your conditioning and any Talents that resist Fear or Insanity don't help with this. **GM Note:** Use this Trait sparingly.

#### **Shards of Memory**
Despite the best efforts of their mental conditioning, strange and disturbing flashes of the past may creep through, materializing in frozen dislocated images in dreams, sudden déjà-vu or inexplicable fears and revulsions that pass in a flickering panicked moment. Table 1-3: Shards of Memory presents a few possible examples (GMs may feel inclined to provide further "episodes").

| **Roll** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–22    | **The Shattered Mirror:** Sensations fill your mind—a vision of a partner and a child, a snatch of a melody, the smell of food cooking, a house, sudden barbs of emotion that flee before they can be grasped. Are they your lost family or maybe your victims?                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23–34    | **The Cold Grave:** Stillness, silence, smothering darkness and utter cold. Cold enough to freeze the soul and burn the mind. Death—you're sure it was; death had claimed you till they brought you back and it waits for you every waking moment, lurking just at the edge of sight, waiting to claim you again.                                                                                                                                               |
| 35–40    | **The Night of the Daemon:** The fire and shadow, the vast terrifying shape of that terrible horned thing looming at the heart of the dark storm, laughing and calling a name you can't quite make out your true name? Only the Daemon knows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41–52    | **The Sole Survivor:** The steel walls are stained with blood, the blood of your friends and comrades. You can hear their screams still as if they were frozen in the air. You wander long corridors empty but for the memory of death, alone, the last survivor envying the dead.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 53–61    | **The Dark Altar:** The ceremony has begun and the awful chanting from robed figures erodes your mind as they move in spirals of night around the dark altar. Your cause is just and your faith unshakable, but you know that however many of the heretics you kill, the terrible chanting burning in your brain won't stop; won't ever stop…                                                                                                                   |
| 62–71    | **The Throne of Blood:** You stand triumphant, your followers' heads bow as you pass, their life and death yours to command, yours by right. Then abruptly all is chaos and ruin, fire and blood. You are shackled and broken, dark figures drag you away, but that sweet taste of powers lingers a moment yet.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 72–80    | **The Nightmare Forest:** You are lost and terrified in the alien landscape. Trees of black glass sing with unnatural voices as the blood-hot wind stirs them. You stumble aimlessly and panicked through the bloated corpse-white loam—it follows you, stalking you. You keep catching glimpses of its foul bulk floating between the jagged black trees, it is working its way closer, slowly moving in and when you see it, you know you will simply go mad. |
| 81–95    | **The Malfian Candidate:** You look down on the opulent assembly from on high; lords and ladies, adepts and priests, glittering with wealth and satiated with power. The greatest among them steps forward and the fawning worthies part as he glides by in stately progress. You raise the weapon to your shoulder and centre the optic sight on his patrician countenance and your finger tightens on the trigger.                                            |
| 96–00    | **The Repairer of Reputations:** You sit begging the strange man in his dim parlour. Only he can help, you plead. It's gone too far, you can't stop it, you're a heartbeat from discovery and if they find you, you'll lose everything. The kindly old man, with eyes like dead stars, smiles slyly as you plead on your knees before him, and the shadows cast by the burning coals behind him are not of a man at all.                                        |
### **Starting Wounds**
Cleansed characters start the game with d5+8 Wounds.

### **Starting Fate Points**
Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–3, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on a 4–9, you begin with 3 Fate Points; on a 10 you begin with 4 Fate Points.

### **Mind Cleansed Careers**
Mind Cleansed characters may take any of the following Career Paths:

#### **Cleansed Arbitrators**
The Adeptus Arbites and local enforcers may well, during the course of their sworn duties, uncover truths too terrible to understand and see things that no man may live through sane. The Inquisition, for its part, sees such unfortunates as prime candidates for mind cleansing and induction into their ranks, burning away what cannot be allowed to remain and leaving a lifetime of training and an ingrained sense of duty.

#### **Cleansed Assassins**
The cleansed assassin is usually little more than a living weapon in the hands of the Holy Ordos, a near disposable tool of death, reprogrammed to serve without question and kill without conscience. They make for able bodyguards and infiltrators, and indeed some may once have been mercenaries, recidivists or other scum that have been captured, cleansed and turned on their former friends.

#### **Cleansed Clerics**
Clerics are among the rarest of cleansed Acolytes, as martyrdom in most cases is deemed preferable for a true servant of the faith than mind scrubbing. Exceptions do exist, however, and the cleansing may leave a cleric shorn away of their past and memories, leaving only fervor and the love of the Emperor behind. Some Radical Inquisitors, with a sense of ironic punishment, may order a heretic or criminal to be remade as a faithful servant of the Emperor to pay for their sins with a lifetime of service. This is frowned on by many traditionalists as an unjustly lenient punishment, added to which, as past events have proven on more than one occasion, as evil may remain in even the most "scrubbed" soul.

#### **Cleansed Guardsman**
The Inquisition has frequent use for inducted military forces when a major raid or suppression is called for. However, it is often necessary that the men and woman involved cannot be allowed to remember what they have done or seen in the Holy Ordos' service. If the risk of corruption is too great, death is the only answer, but if possible, a particularly able servant of the Emperor should not be wasted when they have more left to give.

#### **Cleansed Psykers**
Psykers are prey to all manner of horrors from the warp and frequently prone to mental disorders and trauma, particularly if their abilities have emerged or been discovered late in life. Sometimes where this is the case, the powers-that-be judge that the psyker's talent can be salvaged, but that "who they are" has become irretrievably damaged. The answer for some is to cut away the personality and memories like a surgeon might cut away cancerous tissue from a healthy organ, but as with surgery, the results cannot always be guaranteed.

#### **Cleansed Tech-Priests**
The Adeptus Mechanicus knows that knowledge can be dangerous. The cerebral augmentation of a tech-priest can make the selective destruction of memory easier in fact than with a normal brain. A cleansed tech-priest may have served as part of some secret project or mission that, once complete, merited the wiping of all trace of its knowledge for those involved as a matter of course. Alternately, they may have followed some renegade master, become prey to tech-heresy themselves or simply strayed too far into regions forbidden. Some tech-priests even see mind cleansing as a desirable procedure, ridding them of the weakness of a sentimental attachment to the past.

them from turning on their masters. Only the relevant NPC (their Inquisitor for example), should ever have access to this trigger, which usually must be delivered telepathically or by a specific sonic cadence (a simple code phrase is usually judged too risky).

**Effect:** The trigger works just like the use of the Dominate Psychic Power (see page 178 in Dark Heresy). If the trigger is successful, you may be given an order or set of instructions you must carry out to the best of your abilities. However, if the command is antithetical or directly harmful to you, you may receive an appropriate bonus to resist the control.

## **Noble Born**
*"Some things can be taught, others acquired by simple exchange of coin. What is truly important, though, is carried in the blood."*

— Viola Del Sheen, Matriarch of the Del Sheen.

The high nobility of the Imperium forms the wealthiest and most powerful elite. A breed apart from those they rule. Many noble houses span the stars in an intricate web of kinship, marriage and political alliances that ensure their power and influence go on, even if the fortunes of a single world fail. Products of careful breeding and cultured refinement over centuries (or even millennia), the lineage they hold in their blood is the history of the Imperium itself and they are the finest that humanity has to offer—or so they would have you believe at any rate. Nobility of birth has never been a guarantee of character unfortunately, for every example of true enlightenment or greatness there are dozens of capricious and self-obsessed men and women who prove, by their base failings, that measuring superiority by birth alone in the Imperium is a lie. Worse still than the dissolute idlers and petty tyrants are those whose dark inclinations spill over into heresy and true malignancy, often for no better reason than boredom or a sadistic love of power. It is this last supremely dangerous group that the Inquisition watches for, and combating such powerful and well-resourced heretics is one reason the Holy Ordos draws from the nobility's own ranks to find some of its servants.

From almost their first breath, those born to the high nobility are schooled in the role they must play and how they must play it. Their fine education covers not only the ins and outs of history, commerce and power-politics, but an education in the fine-points of taste and etiquette: how to wear a mask of one's own choosing, how to give an intended slight, how to curry and mete favour, the defence of honour and how to comport oneself in all situations are all lessons deeply ingrained. In some great families, these arts have darker nuances yet; the correct use of poison, a well-executed betrayal and the employment of assassins, all being among them.

Connected, socially skilled, highly educated and able to move in the high circles of Imperial society, those of noble blood are frequently as ruthless as they are charming and as dangerous as they are well mannered, making for skilled infiltrators and subtle Acolytes.

### **Noble Born PCs**
You were born into wealth and privilege, educated by tutors, and tempered by spiteful intrigues. You know how to move in the high circles of Imperial society and how to bend others to your will, and you have never been touched by the harsh life the common citizens must endure. You may be a honourable and faithful soul, well aware of the duties your station imposes on you, or a dissolute rakehell who cares naught for those unfortunate enough to be low born. Either way, the Holy Ordos has taken an interest in you, and you acknowledge that it has a greater power than any your family have ever wielded.

### **Noble Born Skills**
You begin play with Literacy (Int), Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int), and Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int).

### **Noble Born Traits**
Noble born gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Etiquette**
Nobles are schooled in how to comport themselves in all manner of formal situations.

**Effect:** You gain a +10 bonus on Charm, Deceive and Scrutiny Tests when dealing with high authority and in formal situations.

#### **Supremely Connected**
Nobles have extensive connections and you know that dropping the "right" names into a conversation can open more doors than a fistful of Thrones.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Peer (Nobility) talent. In addition, you also gain Peer (Academics, Adeptus Mechanicus, Administratum, Astropaths, Ecclesiarchy, Government, Mercantile, Military or Underworld), selecting one category to reflect your family's powerbase.

#### **Vendetta**
Every noble house has its sworn enemies and rivals who would do it and its members harm. Joining the Holy Ordos doesn't stop this, it merely forces those who wish you harm to be a bit more cautious and subtle in exacting their vengeance.

**Effect:** You have powerful enemies, perhaps in the shape of a rival noble house or some other powerful group. The details of these enemies are left to you and the GM to define, working together to create a formidable threat. While they do not dog your steps at every turn, they are still out there, aiming to inconvenience, harm or kill you when you cross their path, You, of course, are free to return the favour when it's expedient to do so.

#### **Wealth**
Those born into the nobility are also born in to wealth and enjoy the fruits of their family's fortunes.

**Effect:** You begin play with double the starting number of Thrones. You are also Noble for the purposes of determining monthly income (see page 124 of Dark Heresy).

### **Starting Wounds**
Noble Born characters start with d5+8 Wounds.

### **Fate Points**
Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–3, you begin with 1 Fate Point; on a 4–9, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on a 10 you begin with 3 Fate Points.

### **The Past — Lineage of Renown**
Noble houses are each built on different traditions and each has a unique foundation to their position and power. These origins have a huge impact on one born into a noble family. You may roll on Table 1-4: Lineage of Renown to determine your family's traditions.

| **Roll** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–15    | **Merchant Magnates:** Your family controls vast trading operations throughout the sector and beyond. The accumulation of wealth and power through trade requires all scions of the house to have a quick head for business or find themselves marginalized.                                      |
| 16–30    | **Family Militant:** Your house was built by the blood of your forebears who were the heroes of past wars. The family has strong ties with the military wings of the Imperium, and its traditions are bound to those of warrior honour and glory.                                                 |
| 31–45    | **Commanders of Mankind:** Your family is among the hereditary rulers of your world. Your house is among the finest, most powerful and trusted of all noble families, but with enemies to match.                                                                                                  |
| 46–60    | **Provender of the Imperium:** Your house is built on vast holdings which produce the raw materials on which the Imperium depends, be it ore or grain, though you yourself are far removed from such dirty work.                                                                                  |
| 61–75    | **House of the Iron Spires:** You come from one of the high noble houses of a hive world. The fortunes of your house are built on the labour of the multitudes that toil far beneath your family's spire-top manses.                                                                              |
| 76–85    | **The Blood of Greatness:** One of your ancestors was a legendary figure in the Imperium. His or her deeds built your house in a single lifetime and it has endured on their labour and renown ever since.                                                                                        |
| 86–95    | **Rogue's Fortune:** Your family possesses an ancient Rogue Trader charter and their fortunes have been forged by boldness and daring in the darkness between distant stars. Although accepted by your noble peers, they might consider your clan eccentric or dangerous, and not without reason. |
| 96–00    | **Shadowed Blood:** Your family are not what they seem. Some past disgrace, disaster or dishonour haunts the name of your house, and your family possesses but a shadow of its past glories. Your mansions are all but dusty ruins and your name whispered fearfully by those you command.        |

### **Noble Born Careers**
Characters of Noble Birth may take any of the following Career Paths:

#### **Noble Born Adepts**
There are many nobles, particularly those distant from power, who turn their educated minds and fortunes to intellectual pursuits and embark on self-financeProgenad careers acquiring obscure knowledge and cataloguing esoteric subjects, though their curiosity can and often does lead them to trouble.
#### **Noble Born Arbitrator**

A noble house's holdings can be extremely large and its enemies many, and the protection of the house entrusted only to castellans of the same blood. Others of noble blood enter the Arbites as a means to find a purpose, or to increase their own influence and power.

#### **Noble Born Assassins**
The nobility of the Imperium is riven with vendettas and bloody power struggles, and through these delicate wars move the noble Assassins, versed in the etiquette and form of killing; to them assassination is a dance to be executed with precision and, in some cases, relish.

#### **Noble Born Clerics**
The Ecclesiarchy is a high and noble calling as well as being a route to one of the greatest powers in the Imperium: faith. Most noble families have confessors from within their own blood, and some have a few prelates or even cardinals to boot. Imperial history is filled with those of noble birth who have ascended to greatness in the priesthood for good or ill, carried by their noble bearing, flattery and skilled diplomacy.

#### **Noble Born Guardsmen**
Many noble families have traditions of service within the officer class of the Imperial Guard, either as a life-long career or a staging post to greater things. In many cases, young nobles are sent to serve with regiments raised by the family itself, before returning blooded and swelled with glory to serve their family. That is presuming they return at all.

#### **Noble Born Scum**
A noble birth is no guarantee of a noble soul, and the refinement and mannered charm of good breeding can be turned to less than honest pursuits. Murderous rakes and dandy charlatans fallen from great houses, and concealed "embarrassments" that others might label monsters, are more common than the nobility would like others to believe.

## <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Schola Progenium** 
*"We are concerned with the future. The victory of mankind depends on those who lead and those who serve. That responsibility is ours; that future is ours to bring to pass."* — Abbot Bernar Skrayling, Maccabeus Quintus Schola Progenium.

The Schola Progenium takes children whose parents have perished in the service of the Emperor, from daughters of Imperial Guard Officers killed on the battlefield, to sons of administrators lost in the far reaches of the Imperial space, and trains them to become the backbone of Imperial society. Those who pass through the Schola Progenium are called progena, and they receive an education like no other. The fundamental part of life in the Schola Progenium is harsh discipline. From the day they first don their grey garb, the progena learn that the God-Emperor has no use for infirmity of purpose or weakness, and pain is merely and illusion of an untrained mind. Swift correction, prayer, fasting and contemplation are the tools by which a mind of rigid purpose and faith is formed, and the cornerstone of the Schola's teaching. A progena's education moves through predetermined phases, beginning with literacy and the Imperial Creed, and progressing on through history, politics, the contemplation of Imperial saints, rhetoric and leadership skills. The curriculum does not stop at honing the intellect either as all progena are trained in physical endurance and skill at arms by the infamous drill abbots. The drill abbots are hardened veterans and have usually spent half their lives in Imperial military service. Hard, unforgiving and relentless, the lessons imparted by the drill abbots will stay with progena for their entire lives.

As they mature, the progena are groomed for the place they shall take in the service of the Imperium. Many are taken into the Ecclesiarchy, Administratum or some other division of the Adeptus Terra, while others of martial leanings find their place in the officer cadres of the Imperial armed forces or Adeptus Arbites. The finest progena are recruited into the most specialized of the Imperium's elites, such as the Commissariat or Adeptus Sororitas, and a very few are inducted directly into the Inquisition.

### **Schola Progenium PCs**
Progena are creations of the Imperium, trained to be unbending of will, decisive in action and quick of mind. To you, service in the Inquisition is a privilege and a duty to be discharged with all of your soul. There are no questions to be raised and no moral ambiguities to be pondered when it comes to the survival of mankind. You are well prepared to meet any challenge and show contempt for what others consider hardship.

### **Schola Progenium Skills**
Schola Progenium characters are highly literate and well read. You begin play with Literacy (Int), Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int), and Speak Language (Low Gothic) (Int).

### **Progena Traits**
Progena gain the following Traits. Record all of these on your character sheet:

#### **Schola Education**
A progeny's mind is the product of years of careful instruction in the fundamentals of knowledge and learning.

**Effect:** Common Lore (Administratum) (Int), Common Lore (Ecclesiarchy) (Int), Common Lore (Imperial Creed) (Int), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Common Lore (War) (Int), and Scholastic Lore (Philosophy) (Int) are Basic Skills for you.

#### **Skill at Arms**
All progena are instructed by grizzled drill abbots in the arts needed to defend the Emperor's truth and, no matter what their calling, all are willing and able to shed blood if needed.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Basic Weapon Training (Las or SP), Melee Weapon Training (Primitive), and Pistol Training (Las or SP) talents.

#### **Sheltered Upbringing**
Despite their extremely well-rounded education, the progena are largely ignorant of the Imperium's worse elements, breeding a distain they can't ever seem to manage to hide.

**Effect:** You take a –10 penalty on all Charm, Command, Deceive and Scrutiny Tests when dealing with the worst of examples of humanity (cultists, traitors, narco-addicts, gutter scum, mutants and the like).

#### **Tempered Will**
The harsh methods of the Schola Progenium chiefly aim to forge the most crucial weapon a servant of the Emperor has: an unbending will.

**Effect:** Whenever you would attempt a Very Hard (–30) Willpower Test, you only take a –20 penalty for your Characteristic instead of the normal –30.

### **Starting Wounds**
Progena characters start with d5+8 Wounds.

### **Fate Points**
Roll 1d10 to determine your starting Fate Points. On a 1–2, you begin with 1 Fate Point; on a 3–7, you begin with 2 Fate Points; on an 8–10 you begin with 3 Fate Points.

### <span id="page-20-0"></span>**The Past: Orphan**
The Schola aims to form their young charges into perfect servants of the Emperor without unnecessary emotion or individualism. All progena, however, are born of Imperial servants, and the death of their parents is one of the few ties with the past that progena are allowed to have. You may roll on Table 1-5: Family's Fate to determine who your parents were and how they died.

| **Roll** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01–25    | **Warrior Martyr:** Your parents were members of the Imperial Guard and perished at the hands of the enemies of mankind.                                                 |
| 26–45    | **Slaughtered by Rebels:** Your parents were Imperial loyalists caught in a rebellion that brutally claimed their lives.                                                 |
| 46–65    | **Distant Outpost:** Your parents were posted to a distant and lonely outpost, so remote communication could never again be made in your life time.                      |
| 66–75    | **Lost to the Void:** Your parents were devoted servants of the Adeptus Terra and disappeared along with the ship they travelled on.                                     |
| 76–85    | **Without a Trace:** There are no records of what happened to your parents, though you know who they were; at some point, they simply vanished from all records.         |
| 86–95    | **Never to Return:** Your parents were attached to an Imperial crusade or Rogue Trader expedition that ventured far beyond Imperial space and has never returned.        |
| 96–00    | **Not Spoken Of:** No one will talk of your parents or your family. You have no idea how they died or who they were; all enquires about them are met with stony silence. |

**"If I have strayed from the path of obedience it is only to follow the most sacred of all directions, those of the Emperor himself, for is it not written in the Book of the Astronomican. 'A true servant follows his Master if he listens to the heart and not the head."**

### **Schola Progenium Careers**
Characters from the Schola Progenium may take any of the following Career Paths:

#### **Schola Progenium Adepts**
Adepts recruited out of the Schola Progenium are often destined for special duties in the Administratum or in scholastic colleges specializing in particular or difficult areas of knowledge. Such dedicated and hard-willed individuals may find their way to being researchers or archivists serving the Adeptus Arbites, Munitorium or even the Black Ships of the Inquisition.

#### **Schola Progenium Arbitrators**
Many of the finest Arbites are drawn from the Progenium, where their unstinting loyalty to the Imperial Creed and detachment from local society makes them ideal lawgivers and dispensers of justice. Often front line command or high office beckons for progena, but some also find their intellects put to use in special investigation units. The obscure and secretive Inquisitorial Wards draw a high proportion of their number from the Schola Progenium output.

#### **Schola Progenium Clerics**
Products of the Schola are found in all ranks and divisions of the Ecclesiarchy, from the Missionary Galaxia to the parish deacons who maintain the many temporal holdings of the Ministorum. Hardened and educated in the Imperial Creed from an early age, becoming a preacher, confessor or missionary is but a small step for a progena.

#### **Schola Progenium Guardsmen**
The harsh mental and physical discipline of the Schola produces fine material for soldiering. Famously, the storm troopers of the Imperial Guard are almost exclusively drawn from the Schola Progenium, while the Commissariat and Divisio Tactica also sport high number of former progena students.

#### **Schola Progenium Sororitas**
Female progena make up the overwhelming majority of the Adeptus Sororitas. The Schola's spiritual, physical and mental training are the perfect prelude to noviceship in one of the Orders.

# GENERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
Once you Home World or Origin has been rolled or selected, move on to generate Characteristics. The process for Characteristic generation follows that as described in Dark Heresy. Table 1-6: Generating Characteristics presents information for creating a character using a Home World or Origin discussed in this chapter. O

# Unique Worlds of the Calixis Sector 
*"Here is the tread of would-be gods and slain saints. Here is the mark of the darkness yet to come. Here creeps the crown of ancient slaughter yet unborn. Here is the fate of all. All writ amongst these cold stars."*

— Attributed to Erasmus Haarlock, Rogue Trader.

The Character Creation chapter in Dark Heresy and the extra Origins presented earlier in this book cover a huge range of possible life histories and backgrounds for your Player Characters, but the Calixis Sector, (let alone the Imperium) is a vast and diverse place filled with wonders and terrors uncounted. The following section details several unique and often infamous worlds and Origins that can be found within the Calixis Sector and shows the often extreme effects they can have on a character's nature and abilities.

In order to create a character using one of these worlds, use the Home World section of the character creation process as normal but apply the modifications as detailed in the unique home world entry that follows. This usually means swapping out one or more of the home world's usual Traits for those listed in the specific world entry. In the case of granted Talents, disregard the prerequisites, as they are "bred" rather than developed through training. Obviously, you also do not need to roll to determine what type of world you are from.

Example: Sara has rolled Hive World as a starting Home World for her character. Having had a look at the unique Home Worlds, she decides that her character is from Volg, the nastiest hive going. She applies the modifiers as shown in the Volg entry, swapping the usual hive world trait Wary for the Born Survivor, and Grim traits, which are added to her character along with the remaining traits listed in the hive world entry (Accustomed to Crowds, Caves of Steel, and Hive bound). With these five Traits and their effects noted, she carries on with character generation as normal.

## **Battle fleet Calixis (Void Born)**
The men and women of the Imperial Navy's officer class are a breed apart even from other void born. A cornerstone of the Imperium's war machine, they descend from a long and noble line of naval families and warship clans that trace their history of service back millennia into the Imperium's distant past. Many have links to the ruling classes of worlds that administer the battle fleet's ships, where their house and their families are emboldened with grandeur taken from the spoils of war. They are a proud and martially-minded people with a strong sense of personal honour. They respect duty, loyalty and strength of character and despise weakness, inconstancy and deceit. Many are notably much more powerfully built than the void born of trade or chartist vessels, and thanks to their reputation as mankind's shield, they are far better respected, though often seem to lack the void born's legendary good fortune.

The ships of Battle fleet Calixis are widely dispersed across the sector; some maintain the trade routes and well traveled courses of the great chartist vessels, while others patrol the danger zones of the Adrantis Nebula and the Hazeroth Abyss where dark forces lurk still. But their most unpredictable and dangerous task is to guard the border of the Halo Stars, beyond which horrors uncounted and unknown lurk beyond the reach of Imperial space.

### **Battle fleet Calixis PCs**
Characters from a Battle fleet Calixis grand lineage come from a long tradition of heroic sacrifice, adventure and bravery. For generations, it has been their families' sacred duty to keep the Imperium together and functioning by protecting its worlds from aggression and keeping the trade and communication lanes open, and they demand the respect that is their due. Regardless of whether they have followed their kin into direct military service or not, they have a tendency to be loud, confident and brash, but with the skills and mettle to back it up.

#### **Creating Characters from the Imperial Navy**
In order to create characters with an Imperial Navy lineage, use the Void Born template but replace the Charmed and Ill-Omened traits with those described here.

##### **Naval Lineage Skills**
You begin play with the Speak Language (Battle fleet War Cant) (Int) and you treat Common Lore (Tech) (Int) as a Basic Skill.

##### **Close-Quarter Fighter**
The business of the Navy is war, both in the cold void of space between vessels, and in murderous close-quarter boarding actions aboard them, battles for which you have been trained from childhood.

**Effect:** Increase you starting Strength by +5. You also begin play with the Basic Weapon Training (SP) talent. In addition, when engaged in melee combat with your back to a solid wall or in a confined space, such as a narrow corridor, you gain a +5 bonus on Weapon Skill Tests.

However, you are unaccustomed to fighting "dirt side" and you take a –1 penalty on Initiative rolls when fighting outdoors on a planet's surface. Also, you take an additional –10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests when firing a weapon at Long Range or greater.

##### **Officer on Deck**
On a warship, orders are obeyed swiftly and to the letter or people die. The Naval bloodlines are used to bellowing orders and having them carried out, regardless of their actual status in life.

Effect: You gain a +10 bonus on all Command Tests while aboard a star vessel. You also gain a +5 bonus on all Fellowship Tests made to interact with Void Born.

## **Dusk (Feral World)** Dusk(Feral World)

*"Gods of the warp strike me down if I ever return to that place. Oh we landed hard and well armed; a score of us—kill jacks and pirates every one. We took the cutter down to where the tip-off said the deal was happening… empty, nothing but rotten shacks… nothing! Then that devil fog rolled in and all hell broke loose. I made it out running blind—the screams and the laughter and the awful mocking things all around me! Could have been days, could have been hours, I don't know… it was the old hag that dragged me out of the fog, and my left eye she took in payment, but at least I was gone from that haunted place!"*

— The Heretic "Captain" Gadred Bayle, *Interrogation Testimony Vol. 17*.

The world of Dusk is a legendarily dangerous and ill-omened planet on the very edge of the Halo Stars, famed both for the lethality of its wildlife and for the many nightmarish legends and baleful tales clustering around the world like moths to a flame. Dusk is a place of trackless fens, mist-drenched forests, and moss-shrouded wooded swamps—a prime candidate for conversion to mass agriculture, (particularly as its distant locale might allow for further exploitation of the region). Attempt after attempt has been made to colonize Dusk since the days of Angevin's crusade; each has met with disaster, suffering and death, making the world's very name synonymous with ill-omen, sinister mystery and folly.

Dusk's fecund nature is also its curse. Its teaming wetlands breed all manner of fevers, parasites and other morbidities, while its forests and swamps are home to some of the most deadly indigenous life forms in the sector; while moss, fast-growing plant-life, mildew and rot quickly claim any abandoned structure. Worse still, as any psyker or seer will tell you upon setting foot on the world, it is a place where the veil between realspace and the immaterium—between the waking world and nightmare—is very thin indeed.

No accurate census has ever been taken of Dusk's population, and the planet's inhabitants have been formed from a melting pot of colonial survivors, outcasts and wanderers scattered among isolated villages and plantations, where oil lamps and black powder guns are all they have to keep the dark at bay. The Dusk born are insular and superstitious to a degree rarely seen even in the Imperium. Feuding, sudden madness, strange phenomena, mysterious disappearances—all are accepted facts of daily life. The rate of psyker births among the population of the planet is also known to be comparably high, and the people of Dusk have come under Ecclesiarchy and Inquisitorial suspicion for descending into the worship of strange cults and creeds in the past, and several purges have been carried out down the years with visits by the Black Ships comparably frequent despite the world's distant locale. But for all of this, Dusk yet endures, and for those few willing to risk the journey and the dangers of the world itself, Dusk's fecund wildlife and fauna hold great worth in trade both legal and proscribed, and it is these off-worlders that have ensured Dusk's ongoing place as a world of dark repute in the minds of the wider sector.

Fundamentally, Dusk is a world caught on the edge and its inhabitants caught on the brink with it: the edge of known space, the edge of savagery, the edge of sanity and the edge of the endless abyss of the warp.

### **Dusk Born PCs**
The people of Dusk are unsurprisingly well versed in both survival and dark lore from the cradle, and to look into the eyes of the Dusk born is to meet the gaze of someone who has seen terrors most hardened war zone veterans would shrink from. Although often withdrawn, menacing and with a macabre humour, they make for excellent Inquisitorial Acolytes, well-armed by bitter experience against the nature of the perils they must face.

#### **Creating Characters from Dusk**
Use the Feral World Home World template, replacing the Iron Stomach and Rite of Passage traits with those presented here:

##### **Dusk Native Skills**
You begin play with the Speak Language (Dusk Cant) (Int) skill.

##### **Bad Blood**
The Dusk born are an ill-omened people, considered by most to be accursed by the simple fact of their birth world. Truth be told, there is some credence to this belief as trauma, madness, supernatural occurrences and morbid eccentricity are all common currency on Dusk as accepted facts of life.

**Effect:** Dusk characters begin the game with 1d5 Insanity points and 1d5 Corruption points. They also benefit from a +3 increase to both their Perception and Willpower Characteristics.

##### **Dark Tales**
One key way of learning to survive for a child on Dusk is to pay heed to the many strange tales and nightmarish stories told by the fireside when the storms howl or the dank fogs press close, and the stories of Dusk hold many dark truths and shadowed pearls of wisdom.

**Effect:** You start the game with Common Lore (Dusk Folklore) (Int). In addition, you treat Forbidden Lore (Demonology) (Int) and Scholastic Lore (Occult) (Int) as Basic Skills.

##### **Little Left to Fear**
While other worlds may indeed host worse perils than Dusk, the dangers encountered there are of a singularly macabre and often horrific kind, and after a lifetime spent surviving them, the bestial predators and weird happenings of other worlds hold little terror.

**Effect:** You reduce the effects of Fear on your character by one degree (reducing Fear 3 to Fear 2, etc.) Essentially this also means that you suffer no effects from creatures or phenomena with a Fear Rating of 1. Since your life has been full of near-scrapes with things best left unsaid, you also reduce your starting number of Fate Points by –1.

## **Gunmetal City— Scintilla (Hive World)**
"Welcome lords and ladies, saints and sinners, young and old, child and grand sire! Welcome to the thunder of the guns, the trail of life, the judgment of the swift and the dead! Welcome to the Sands of Blood: the greatest show in Gunmetal City! Just a few more minutes and you'll see the bullets fly!"*

— The Crooked Man, Master of Ceremonies at the Sands of Blood.

Ringing the crater of Mount Thollos is the hot metal and black powder scorched hive of Gunmetal City. Sustained by the output of its fanes and forges who produce billions of firearms in almost endless variation, Metallican society truly is built and ruled by the gun. Here power and loyalty are shifting, precarious things bartered, bribed and bled for between dozens of clans and guilds, fanes and mercenaries. From the families of the highest spires through the great bulk of the population that toil in the foundries and manufactora, right down to the infamous gun clans of the Infernis in the swelter of the under hive, the harsh roar of a gunshot settles all arguments, but rarely with any finality. Gunmetal City is an upstart hive, still young and growing from the wealth its lethal trade brings. It is a vibrant, bold, frenetic and dangerous place, a place where fortunes can be made and power grasped, if one has the luck, skill and courage to do so.

Beyond nerve and skill with a pistol, Metallican society respects only a person's oath and craftsmanship. No matter what their standing, all Metallicans understand and appreciate the craft of the gunsmith, able to admire the superb action of a Hecuter 9/5 and pour reasoned scorn upon a Volg zipper gun. Even the lowliest hab-worker knows how to shoot, even if they must lease their weapon from their employers and have never pulled the trigger in anger. The gun clans of the Infernis are another matter entirely; these warring gangs rule the scorching hot lower margins of the hive, and they are legendarily well-armed and willing to resort to lethal violence over the slightest provocation or cause. Hired killers bred in the baking heat and anarchic conflicts of the Infernis command a high price as mercenaries and bodyguards across Scintilla and beyond, and more than a few have found their way into the service of the Holy Ordos.

### **Metallican PCs**
A Metallican is accustomed to the constant presence of gun violence and lawlessness on a level more profound than is usually found in even the most violent or militant of Imperial hives. To have a gun is to hold your life in your hands, and to go unarmed is to willingly surrender to death or slavery, whether your trade is as a mercenary or scholar. Because of the anarchic and precarious nature of their lives, Metallicans tend to be proud, sometimes self-absorbed, and highly sensitive to insult or slight. Conversely they are usually very respectful of any authority earned through knowledge or by skill at arms, and anyone willing to put their lives on the line for family, cause or creed.

#### **Creating Metallican Characters**
Use the Hive World Home World template, replacing the Accustomed to Crowds trait with those presented here:

##### **Gunmetal Hiver Skills**

You begin play with the Speak Language (Metallican Hive Dialect) (Int) skill.

##### **Packing Iron**
Metallicans put great store in their guns, be it the simple single shot snub that workers are allowed to carry or a stub jack's custom dueling piece. They invest them both with their sense of self-worth and almost supernatural qualities of protection. If a Metallican swears an oath, it is on their iron.

**Effect:** If you are, for any reason without a usable gun, either because you have been disarmed, caught unawares, or run out of ammunition, you take a –5 penalty on all Tests.

##### **Way of the Gun**
All Metallicans know how to use a variety of firearms and most are better than average shots; it's just in their blood.

**Effect:** Increase your Ballistic Skill by +5. You also begin play with the Pistol Training (SP) talent. You gain a +5 bonus on Tech Use Tests involving projectile firearms.

## **Maccabeus Quintus (Imperial World)** 
*"Here a man died and a saint was born. It is a place of blessedness and of legends, and its time shall come!"*

— Pontifex Grabrilus of Maccabeus Quintus.

A world of vast dry salt flats, dust-laden winds, and harsh chill sun; the fifth planet of the unforgiving Maccabeus star is nevertheless a blessed place. Blessed not because of the resources it is gifted with (which are few), or because of the climate (which is harsh), but because of faith that grows in the dust like the Ghost fire blooms on far Iocanthos. For this is the place were a great man fell and was raised up a saint by the glory of the Emperor.

The holy chronicles tell in the dawning days that General Drusus, commanding the Trail ward salient of Angevin's Crusade, had pushed towards the Halo Stars, hoping to carve out a stable domain in what had been a fraught and bitter decade of war, when a sudden vicious resurgence of hostilities in the systems around Spectoris at his rear caused his advance to shudder to a halt. The order to mass and regroup was given. The planet chosen for this gathering was an un-colonized world in the obscure and unoccupied Maccabeus system, and as Drusus's forces gathered, the general himself prayed for guidance, knowing that a wrong choice could result in the collapse of the salient and jeopardize perhaps the fate of the whole Crusade. Infamy struck, and employing unholy methods, his enemies discovered Drusus's location and unleashed a deadly and unnatural assassin against him. Drusus fell, but even as the killing blow was struck did the power of the Emperor rent the assassin apart and spared the great man. After ten days and nights in shadow did Drusus return, and the power of the Emperor was within him. In the years that followed, Drusus knew not defeat, and one after the other did his enemies fall and Calixis was born. So it was that on dry Maccabeus Quintus, the Emperor raised Drusus up, the life of a man ended and the life of a saint began.

Today Maccabeus Quintus is a world of hard, bright light and deep darkness: of open, echoing spaces, cold, arid planes and great shrine cities from which colored prayer pennants flutter. It is also a distant counterweight and perhaps one day will be a threat to the primacy of the Ecclesiarchy's holdings on Scintilla. To those born and raised in the cold shadows of the Maccabean shrine cities, faith is central to their lives. They know that no matter the harshness of their lives, they are the children of a place favored in the sight of the Emperor.

### **Maccabian PCs**
Faith is so much a part of your life that it is as essential as the air you breathe. To ask whether you are faithful is like asking whether you are alive. You are a Maccabian and even if you are a rogue or a killer, that means you are blessed in the sight of the God-Emperor.

#### **Creating Maccabian Characters**
Use the Imperial World Home World template, replacing the Superior Origins trait with the ones detailed here:

##### **Barren World**
Maccabeus Quintus is an arid and bitterly cold world with a harsh, bright sun, and prone to terrible famines and droughts which leave their mark even on its strongest inhabitants.

**Effects:** You take a –5 penalty on all Perception Tests that involve sight. In addition, reduce your starting Toughness by –3. In exchange, you begin play with the Resistance (Cold) talent.

##### **Beloved of the God-Emperor**
To be born on the shrine world of Maccabeus Quintus is to know that you are born of a place blessed by miracles and touched by a saint.

**Effect:** Increase your starting number of Fate Points by 1.

## **Sinophia (Imperial World)** 
*"Cursed? No not cursed. Who can say that amongst all these riches?"*

— Sire Morcar Del Sheen, The Sanctum Cells, Sinophia Magna.

Sinophia was once a world of pivotal destiny and economic power on the very edge of the Calixis Sector but is now little more than forlorn and forgotten relic of the past, an ancient and mouldering world of deserted cities and faded grandeur. Robbed of its population and trapped in an economic downward spiral that has lasted centuries, the planet is rife with petty corruption, apathy and slow decay. Its remaining inhabited areas are a wasteland of neglect and partial abandonment, ruled by a bickering, jaded aristocracy headed by a near-powerless figurehead governor, while its people labour under the heavy burden of the taxes imposed on them by their dissolute masters. Shorn of hope and empty of purpose, Sinophia is a world slowly dying.

Founded in elder days as the personal fief of the Rogue Trader Teresa Sinos, the world would, a millennium later, serve as a primary staging post for the Angevin Crusade that carved the Calixis Sector into being. But as the centuries passed and Calixis coalesced into its own sovereignty and self-sufficiency, Sinophia's prominence began to wane as its purpose faded. Increasingly sidelined and marginalized, much of its population, sickened by the excesses of the nobility, began to flee. Many took passage as colonists, lured by the perceived freedoms of life on new worlds, while their embittered rulers attempted to fight back with spiteful intrigues and secret plots, but only succeeded in further bankrupting their world and dooming Sinophia to its blighted fate.

Sinophia, today, is a world suffering the final throws of a long drawn-out death by economic starvation and slow civil collapse. Criminality and corruption are utterly ingrained and what little off-world contact it has is with smugglers, independent cartels (themselves skirting the fringes of the law) and a few hardy <span id="page-25-0"></span>pilgrims. Whole cities lie deserted, and where Imperial civilization does exist, it does so in twilight, clinging desperately to the faded glories of the past amidst the crumbling decay of the present.

### **Sinophian PCs**
Malaise, melancholy and corruption (in both the mundane and esoteric senses) are the abiding qualities of the Sinophian people—hope is simply a word, faith and ambition are the subjects of quiet, bitter mockery, and selfishness is viewed as a survival trait. Sinophians are, to put it bluntly, a morose, fearful, self-absorbed and often vicious and untrustworthy lot, and usually assume that everyone else is the same. There are obviously plenty of exceptions to this stereotype, both good and bad, and perhaps the most dangerous of them are the ones who genuinely have found a cause to believe in, because they often take to it with the fanaticism of a true convert.

#### **Creating Sinophian Characters**
Use the Imperial World Home World template, replacing the Blessed Ignorance, Hagiography, and Superior Origins traits with the ones detailed here:

##### **Blighted Origins**
Growing up in the slow decay of Sinophia burns bitterness, malaise and regret into the soul. It teaches you to watch your back and never trust anyone but yourself. These lessons have not been gained without a price…

**Effect:** Increase your starting Perception Characteristic by +5 and gain the Paranoia talent. Reduce your starting Willpower and Fellowship Characteristics by –3 each.

##### **Decayed Society**
Sinophian society is a decayed shadow of its former greatness: corruption and moral rot have penetrated into its every crevice and walk of life.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Deceive (Fel) skill. You also treat Common Lore (Underworld) (Int), Forbidden Lore (Cults) (Int), and Forbidden Lore (Heresy) as Basic Skills.

## **Volg Hive—fenksworld (Hive World)**
*"If you go to that Emperor-forsaken place, take their advice: keep a bullet. Always keep one. Not for them, you understand—no, keep it for yourself."*

— Investigator Verger Bor.

Within the Calixis Sector, and possibly even beyond, Volg has a justified claim to being the most blighted, miserable, hell-sent place one could have the misfortune to be born in. Poisoned by the effluent of its siblings, Volg exists for one purpose only; to supply the other hives and settlements of Fenksworld with purified water and recycled products from run-off waste and the acidic silt of the mire in which it sits. Rather than reaching towards the heavens, Volg plunges down into the fetid depths. When viewed from above, its filth encrusted domes, corroded gantries and sucking vapor intakes nestle in the fens like the boils and scabs of some chronic disease digging into the planet's carcass.

Despite all this hopelessness and horror, a population of hardy men and women, descended in the main from convicts and outcasts, has not just survived but begun to thrive in the harsh conditions, although what kind of life they lead and, if they remain sane is open to some debate. Life is, if anything, appallingly precarious in Volg, pollution poisoning, rotting plagues, chem-spills and starvation are all common, and yet commoner still is murder, for violence is omnipresent and Volg's society brutal. Nor are the Volgites alone. In the depths there are things—pale, stinking, bloated things that writhe and hunger. The rail-walks and gate-landings are studded with hand-cranked stubbers trained on the darkness below, guarding against the nightmarish things that regularly seek to crawl up and feast. Volgites know not to trust to such protection, to trust anything or anyone but themselves, to keep watch on the dark and keep their mercy killer close. To survive in Volg, one needs more than just strength or even luck; one needs steel in the soul, an utter lack of conscience, constant vigilance, and perhaps a touch of destiny.

#### **Volg PCs**
One thing that can be said of a Volg hiver; they are hard to kill. After all, they have reached adulthood in a place that consumes thousands by disease, malnutrition, and the rotting effect of pollutants. Less "fast-mouthed rake" and more "hard eyed stone killer", the Volg born are utterly committed to their own survival and have little compunction in doing what it takes to achieve the next breath.

#### **Creating Volg Characters**
Use the Hive World Home World template, replacing the Wary trait with the ones detailed here:

##### **Volg Hiver Skills**
You begin play with the Intimidate (S) and Speak Language (Volg Hive Dialect) (Int) skills.

##### **Born Survivor**
Anyone who has survived to reach adulthood in a place like Volg has learned how to think fast, deal with horror and save their own skin—if they hadn't, they'd have wound up dead in a chemical pit already.

**Effect:** You begin play with the Jaded, Light Sleeper and Melee Weapon Training (Primitive) talents.

##### **Grim**
Volgites are tight-lipped and dour survivors with a mean streak as wide as a Titan's stride, and a certain worrying tendency to psychosis.

**Effect:** Swap your starting Fellowship and Toughness values, so that you have a starting Toughness of 25+2d10 and a Fellowship of 15+2d10. You also begin the game with 1d10 Insanity Points.

# Marked by the Past— Calixian Background Packages 
*"The fires through which we pass in this life are but the light of the Emperor's forge. Our triumphs and tragedies are the heat by which we are tempered into weapons fit for his service."* — Commissar Captain Jourian Al'Eutar, Gunmetallicus 41st.

The following section details a variety of optional Background Packages for your characters. These backgrounds offer your Acolytes an extra level of detail by filling in more of their past and experiences before joining the Inquisition; providing your character with a "story" of their own. Each presents some "hooks" to help you form a basis for their personality, beliefs and goals, not to mention the reason why they have come to the attention of the Holy Ordos.

Depending on your character's Career, the Background Package may take the form of a particular academic school you attended, a terrible event you were caught up in, a war you fought, a sect you belonged to, or even a case you investigated. Regardless, this event marks a pivotal moment in your character's development.

As well as providing your character with a history, each Background Package also comes with an effect, in terms of particular Skills, Talents or Traits (some of them quite unique) for your character to have developed as a result of your past. In many cases, these packages also feature some fairly serious drawbacks either in the shape of some deficiency of ability, or perhaps even in terms of Insanity or Corruption Points; the 41st Millennium is a dark place after all, and all knowledge has its price.

## **Using Background Packages** 
Background Packages provide a suite of Characteristic adjustments, Skills, Talents and, in some cases, Traits. Any adjustments to your character by selecting a Background Package does not count as an Advance for the purpose of increasing your Rank, nor do increases or reductions count toward the improvement of your Characteristics through normal means.

To select a Background Package, you must meet its requirements. All of the following packages are organised by Career Path and thus you may only select a package that matches your chosen (or rolled) path. Many Background Packages also include a Home World or Origin requirement, which you must also meet. Finally, Background Packages all have an xp cost, which must be paid from your starting experience during character creation. The price covers the whole Background Package; you can't spend less for parts of it. It's all or nothing. Likewise, you may find that packages grant you Talents you might not otherwise be able to take owing to Characteristic restrictions. You do not have to meet the requirements of any listed Talent gained from the package since the benefits is undoubtedly hard earned!

You may only acquire a Background Package at the start of Character Creation. You cannot go back and select a package later in your character's Career, nor can you ever have more than one Background Package. Background Packages are entirely optional and you should always get your GMs permission before selecting one for your character.

Example: Wells has rolled up a Void Born Assassin character and wants to take a Background Package. He looks up those available for the Assassin Career and finds there are three options, the Moritat, Astral Knives and the Sons of Dispater. He checks the packages' requirements and sees that the Moritat is not open to Void Born characters, and so must choose from the other two. He selects the Astral Knives option (fancying the idea of a being a deluded cultist) and, having received the go ahead from his GM, he applies the package effects to his character: he adds the additional full Skills and base Skills listed under Effects on to his character sheet, and rolls 1d5 Corruption Points. He also marks off 200 xp (the package's cost) from his starting xp and goes on to spend the rest of his xp normally.

You can off course vary the "story" within the package to suit your own tastes and ideas—and indeed you are encouraged to do so—so long as the effects and cost are the same of those listed. It's also recommended that no two Player Characters in your group use the same package for the sake of variety, unless of course your GM has a fiendish plan in mind…

## **Adepts: Knowledge is Power**
All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Adepts.

### **Munitorium Quastor**
**Cost:** 100 xp
The Departmento Munitorium is a vast and unforgiving organisation with the relentless task of keeping the Imperium's armed forces supplied with everything from star ship plasma cores to bootlaces and bullets. This, as can be imagined, requires a great deal of unimaginably complex logistical effort and administration. Thus the role of the quastor in this is one of unblinking oversight and ruthless control. Such individuals must also see that harsh discipline and work quotas are rigidly enforced, and remain vigilant for signs of rebellion or <span id="page-27-0"></span>malcontent. Regularly targeted by criminals and even cultists who seek to plunder arms and equipment, not to mention by the vengeance of aggrieved labourers and prisoners, quastors have a justified reputation as being dour, humourless and a justly paranoid lot.

The quastor's life is neither safe nor pleasant, but the attention to detail and arbitrary judgment it engenders are of obvious use in a servant of the Holy Ordos. Any quastor inducted into the ranks of the Inquisition is likely to find they have simply swapped one set of familiar dangers for far larger and even more terrible perils.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:
**Characteristics:** Reduce your starting Willpower and Fellowship each by –5.
**Skills:** You gain Command (Fel), Common Lore (Imperial Guard) (Int), Inquiry (Fel), Search (Int), and Security (Ag) as starting Skills.
**Talents:** You begin play with Paranoia.

### **Scholar of the Colleges Hetaireia Lexis**
**Home World:** Imperial World or Noble. 
**Cost:** 100 xp

The Hetaireia Lexis is a loose organisation of academic and private institutes, devoted to learning and the higher arts, with a strange and cheered history. Established by Lord Sector Caracalla some six centuries ago, their independence and rights are protected by a binding legal charter granting them rare autonomy despite being outside the control of the Adepta. Over the years, the Hetaireia has survived numerous changes in sector governorship, Ecclesiarchy opposition, scandals, murders, heresy trials, blasphemous rumors and even a full Inquisitorial purge of one of its contributing bodies, and yet continues to operate to this day. There are perhaps a dozen separate institutions operating under the Hetaireia's umbrella and scattered across the sector. They range from small cloistered scriptoriums with no more than a few score students to the Lexis Maxima—a labyrinthine complex housing over a thousand scholars in the shadow of the Lucid Palace itself in Hive Sibellus.

Many Inquisitors regard the Hetaireia as a breeding ground for dangerous ideas and freethinkers. Others see the learned men and women it produces as a potentially valuable resource to be exploited. For such a scholar coming to the Inquisition's notice, life as an Acolyte is usually a far more preferable fate to the potential alternatives.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase your Intelligence by +3. Reduce your Weapon Skill and Strength each by –5.

**Skills:** You gain Ciphers (Secret Society—Hetaireia) (Int), Forbidden Lore (any one) (Int), and Scholastic Lore (any one) (Int) as starting Skills.

**Talents:** You begin the game with Peer (Academic).

### **Void Commercia**
**Home World:** Void Born. 
**Cost:** 200 XP

The Calixis Sector thrives on trade for without it, it would wither and die. Maintaining this trade is no easy task as interstellar travel is a dangerous, disturbing and esoteric business, and usually best left to those born to its vagaries. So in order to protect their interests, the various planetary based guilds, corporations and noble houses that make up this vast economic network each maintain a staff of highly trained and specialized adepts to act as their agents and administer their cargos as they make passage between the stars. These specialised adepts—the Void Commercia as they are known—are usually recruited and trained under contract from the Administratum itself, although some larger organisations are more than able to draw them entirely from their own ranks.

Unlike most adepts, Void Commercia are usually quite familiar with the experience of star-travel and delight in their pampered life, serving as a mouthpiece for a distant master. Now suborned or cashiered into the Inquisition's service for their skills and specialised knowledge, the demands on them are far different and they are expected to leave old loyalties behind. No one will watch out for them now, leaving them to fend for themselves.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce your Weapon Skill and Toughness each by 5.

**Skills:** You gain Barter (Fel), Charm (Fel), Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Common Lore (Mercantile) (Int), Evaluate (Int), Scrutiny (Per), and Secret Tongue (your former master's organisation† ) (Int) as starting Skills.

† For example, you might choose Goldentongue for the trade guilds of Hive Tarsus or Cordcordia for the DeVayne Corporation.

## **Arbitrators: Case File Access Denied**
All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Arbitrators.

### **The Calixian Pattern Killings**
**Cost:** 200 xp

In form, the gruesome killings are unremarkable: a throat slashed by a blade of exceeding sharpness, in some cases severing the head completely; sometimes the corpse is further slashed and dismembered and organs are removed. Crimes of such violence are sadly not uncommon in the Imperium, but in this case something far darker is transpiring, for the killings form an ongoing pattern separated by geography and time, sometimes whole worlds apart. The finest seers and savants have been driven mad for merely focusing their minds on the mystery and for centuries the killings have not stopped, nor has their meaning been deciphered.

The diversity of the victims and the locale of the crimes are great. Some are the lowliest of workers slaving in a processing mill, others have been wealthy and important individuals killed in their homes. All the killings occur at night, in some cases a darkened public space mere yards away from other citizens who hear nothing of the crime done so close to them. Some victims have been found dead in locked rooms, the only access a window opening to a perilously long drop. Those who have caught a glimpse of the killer give a consistent and disturbing set of details: a pair of eyes glittering so they almost appear to burn, a strange fluid quickness of movement, and the swirl of a dark cloak or the repeated tap of a cane. All who have confronted him (or it) have been left maimed or dead.

The Holy Ordos and the Tyrantine Cabal in particular, maintain a constant watch for examples of the pattern repeating; sifting mountains of data in the vain hopes of discerning its dark purpose. In doing so sometimes they come across an arbitrator or even a local enforcer with the wit and skill to detect the pattern themselves, these individuals are often inducted into Inquisitorial service the alternative, after all, is somewhat wasteful.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase either Intelligence or Perception by +5.

**Talents:** You begin play with Talented (Inquiry).

### **The Empty Men of Sinophia Magna**
**Cost:** 100 xp

A little over three years ago, reports reached Ordos Calixis of a series of gruesome and bizarre deaths in the city of Sinophia Magna that shocked even the inhabitants of that benighted world. The truth of what happened has been completely suppressed. However, stories persist on Sinophia of widespread casualties, of Arbites turning on each other and, most dreadfully, of men transforming into ravening monsters with inhuman strength, driven to rend apart their own bodies and any others they could reach.

The terrible truth behind these stories lay in a conspiracy and a failed plot by the heretical tech-cult known as the Logicians to perform the utterly forbidden act of the combining the sacred human form with xenos biology and raise an army of "perfected" humans. The horrific culmination of the investigation saw the destruction of the Adeptus Arbites precinct-house by traitors within, and a full-scale Inquisition-led raid on the PDF medicae center where the deviant bio-alchemists of the cult had pursued their transgenic blasphemy. Those that saw what lurked inside the sub-levels of that facility, hidden so carefully from human sight, were forever scarred by the revelation.

Many of the loyal arbitrators that fought during the affair where taken into the Inquisition in the days and months that followed. The survivors themselves have been marked by the horrors that they saw. These qualities may be particularly valued by Ordo Xenos Inquisitors of Monodominant leanings, as soldiers in the war to keep mankind from the corruption of the alien and the evil within.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character. Talents: You gain Hatred (Tech Heretics) and Paranoia. Insanity Points: You gain 1d5 Insanity Points.

### **The Red Vaults of Luggnum**
**Cost:** 100 xp

Heresy likes to find quiet, unloved and unobserved places to take root. The mining world of Luggnum was undoubtedly fertile ground for it to grow. For years, dark reports and rumours of misrule leaked from the domains of Lady Orlea Grey on this backwater mining world. When sub-sector Arbites control finally despatched a fifty strong investigation and suppression force expecting to find some starving cult hiding in the mines, they walked instead into a veritable hell that took their lives and shredded their sanity. Confronted with murder-mazes where hapless workers had been hunted through the subterranean passageways by killrigged servitors bonded to unholy devices that craved flesh and blood to thrive, the few that escaped to the upper levels learned the dreadful truth that the entire mining complexes had been turned into a hedonistic charnel house by Lady Grey—the "Crimson Countess" as she was called by her favoured intimates. Lady Grey constructed the place for her own bloody sport and that of the corrupted owners of Luggnam's Ironback mines. A full scale Castigation Purge by the sector Arbites and the Ordo Hereticus followed, but it was not until much later that the true secret was discovered: Lady Grey was not herself. She was, in fact, one of the most infamous heretics in the sector—Myrchella Sinderfell, the "Red Angel of Vaxanide", a women thought dead for over a hundred years. Some believe she survives in spite of the Castigation, since her body was never recovered from the ruins of Grey's fortified estate.

The Arbites that survived the initial investigation into the Red Vaults are few, but hardened by what the terrors they encountered. The Inquisition quickly found use for many of their small number. Particularly, they are suited to work with more brutal Inquisitors, whose methods are easily stomached by these cold-eyed men and women who have seen the terrible price of letting heresy fester.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase Willpower by +3.

**Talents:** You begin play with the Jaded talent.

**Insanity Points:** You start the game with 1d5 Insanity Points.

## **Assassins: Societies of Murder**

All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Assassins.

### **The Astral Knives**
**Home World:** Void Born.
**Cost:** 200 xp

As members of a proscribed Imperial Death Cult, the Astral Knives must keep their beliefs secret to all but their most trusted confidents. A secret society within the closed society of the void born, the Astral Knife cult takes it upon themselves, as a sacred duty, to keep mankind safe during voyages through the warp. If a voyage suffers, dark portents are witnessed or danger draws close in the warp, the Astral Knives carry out a sacrifice to ensure the Emperor's protection. Those most obviously "unclean" targets, such as mutants and psykers, are selected first, but almost anyone might be selected in consultation with ritual foretelling.

Some fifty years ago the Ordos Calixis declared the Astral Knives a heretical sect after it was found that worshippers of the Ruinous Powers had infiltrated large parts of the cult, and a concerted purge was undertaken. Despite this, the entrenched and widely dispersed death cult lives on, although scattered and in far fewer in numbers than before.

An Astral Knife cultist is usually born rather than made, with certain void families having long traditions of involvement with the cult, either as assassins themselves or in tacitly providing support. Nor are they ravening killers. They are taught instead that their murders, often arranged to seem as accidents, are a dreadful but necessary duty. Some members grieve over their victims when appropriate, although many seek to hone their skills further by taking payment for the use of their skills among the void born, particularly if the target is a "dirtsider" or not of the ship.

Some more Radical elements of the Inquisition have chosen, where possible, to absorb the surviving untainted Astral Knives into their service as skilled spies and killers, and the Knives for their part, are keen to prove their faith.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You begin play with Ciphers (Secret Society—Astral Knives) (Int) and Deceive (Fel). You may also treat Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Int) and Tech Use (Int) as Basic Skills.

**Corruption:** You start the game with 1d5 Corruption Points.

**Note:** Astral Knives are members of a proscribed society. If this becomes generally known, they may well suffer the wrath of the Arbites, witch hunters and Inquisitors less "understanding" than their master.

### **The Moritat**
**Home World:** Feral World, Imperial World or Hive World. 
**Cost:** 300 xp

The Moritat is an Imperial Death Cult, far older than Calixis itself. Some legends say it was brought to Calixis by adherents secreted among the forces of the Angevin Crusade who carved the sector into being. Others claim it was already seeded in place, waiting for the Imperials when they came. Regardless, the Moritat leans heavily on the Imperial Creed, albeit with a very bloody and mystical interpretation of its dogma. It teaches that only through the merciless application of violence and death can the Imperium be sustained, the weak and corrupt winnowed out and the Emperor's own great sacrifice honoured. In organisation, the Moritat is supremely difficult to infiltrate or pin down, operating in independent cells each led by a single master or mistress seeded in recruiting grounds such as underhives, feral world wildernesses and war zones. The Moritat selects those who have already been "marked" by tragedy and bloodshed to serve the Emperor as a bringer of death to His enemies. They take these individuals from a young age and forge their bitterness and hate into a weapon. Training recruits relentlessly in the arts of destruction, deception and bloodletting, while at the same time indoctrinating them into their own brand of Imperial faith and the mysteries of the cult. Moritat aspirants who survive this education become full members of the cult and are sent out alone into the wider Imperium—a process they call the "travail" to hone their skills as assassins, vigilantes and peerless duellists, believing that only through continuous conflict and bloody experience can they become supreme in their arts and worthy to serve the Emperor.

The existence of the Moritat is something of an open secret in the hierarchy of the Calixian noble houses and the Adepta, although facts about them are scarce in the extreme. The cult's existence also seems to benefit from some measure of toleration by the Imperium's higher powers, a fact that leads some to whisper that the Moritat's true sponsorship lies with the distant and dreaded temples of the Officio Assasinorum itself.

For a Moritat Assassin, the chance to serve the Inquisition is a blessed thing—dealing death to the God-Emperor's enemies first hand and also a proving ground where they can Test their skills against the most dire and powerful opposition imaginable. Many Inquisitors regard Moritat Assassins as invaluable resources, monsters of their own to fight the many monsters they must challenge.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce Fellowship by –5.

**Skills:** You begin the game with Climb (S), Secret Tongue (Moritat) (Int), Shadowing (Ag), and Silent Move (Ag).

**Talents:** You gain the Jaded talent.

**Insanity Points:** You start the game with 1d5 Insanity Points. **Equipment:** Replace your normal starting equipment with the following: mono-sword, six throwing knives, crossbow pistol and twenty bolts, grapnel and line, equipment harness, 3 doses of stimm, and a protective bodyglove (2 points Primitive armour to the Body, Arms and Legs).

**"Identify your target. Concentrate your fire on it to the exclusion of all else. When it is destroyed choose another target. That is the way to secure victory."**

**The Bloody Edge (Trait):** the Moritat disdain many modern weapons as crude and spiritually unfulfilling, preferring instead the sacred edge of the blade. As a result, they must pass a Hard (–20) Willpower Test to use any weapon lacking an "edge" in combat (thrown blades, knives and arrows are fine) unless they obviously have no chance of harming their enemy otherwise. However, such is their deadly artistry at bloodletting, any edged weapon wielded by them counts as having the Tearing quality when used against living targets.

### **The Sons of Dispater**
**Cost:** 100 xp

The Sons of Dispater care only for money. For them, every life has its price and only the station of the target and the ease of the kill mitigate the cost. The Sons started life as a mercenary company taking part in the vicious trade wars that flared up in the sector. It slowly coalesced into its modern shape, but with this refinement, it evolved to become a freelance guild of assassins, providing skilled murderers, duellists and saboteurs to anyone who could afford them. Over the years, the Sons have built up a well-deserved reputation for reliability and lethality and their reach extends outwards from their centre of operations on Malfi to almost every important world in the sector. While their only loyalty is to the gelt they have been paid, the organisation does consider its contracts to be inviolate, realising long ago that an organisation of turncoat assassins would have a very short life expectancy. Thus, any member of the Sons that betrays a contract had better hide their tracks very carefully or risk the wrath of their own.

The Inquisition is not above hiring an assassin trained by the Sons of Dispater, valuing their skills and predicable motivations. Likewise, the assassin may have fallen foul of the Inquisition unwittingly (a member of the Holy Ordos is one of the few targets the Sons consider off-limits), and now has little option but to make amends.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You gain Common Lore (Underworld) (Int), Intimidate (S) and Security (Ag) as starting Skills.

**Equipment:** Exchange the sword that Assassins normally gain for a stub automatic, a silencer and two clips of ammunition.

**Note:** Any Sons of Dispater character who breaks or reneges on a contract—even at the Inquisition's behest—and lets this information leak out, acquires a death-mark from their erstwhile colleagues in the guild, requiring all members to kill the renegade on sight.

## <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Clerics: Covenants of the Faithful** 
All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Clerics.

### **The Great Chantries of Tarsus**
**Home World:** Noble, Imperial World, or Hive World. **Cost:** 200 xp

The center of the Ecclesiarchy's power in the Calixis Sector is undoubtedly the great Cathedral of Illumination in Hive Tarsus on the capital world of Scintilla. In the shadow of this great edifice to Imperial faith lies hundreds of minor chapels, priories and monastic orders, each serving some facet of worship, pilgrimage, or the monolithic bureaucracy of the Ecclesiarchy itself. Among these are the great chantries, colleges created to train those talented enough (or wealthy enough) for high rank within the priesthood. Many chantries are sponsored by individual noble houses or dogmatic sects who seek to further their own ends by influencing subsequent generations of the clergy. To their detractors, these chantries are at best divisive and, at worse, seditious breeding grounds for heresy or purely secular greed and ambition. Still, their presence and role has become the accepted tradition, and it is a powerful one.

Of the chantries, the Drusine is the oldest and most mysterious. The Scoriaen is a zealous hotbed whose claim is the great number of witch hunters they have produced in the past. Many nobles choose the Vulpine as a dumping ground for unwanted and unruly "children", while the recently founded Ignatian chantry is little more than a creature of the current high cardinal, made to consolidate his grip on power.

A cleric trained in a Tarsus chantry is likely to be more politically-minded than most and may harbour ambitions for high office one day. Some may see a role within the Inquisition as a stepping-stone to greatness or the vocation of Ordo-sanctioned witch hunter as their true calling. In either case a Tarsine Priest makes for a spiritually knowledgeable, worldly-wise and politically skilled Acolyte.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase Intelligence and Fellowship Characteristics by +5. Reduce Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Strength Characteristics all by –5.

**Skills:** You begin play with Charm (Fel), Common Lore (Ecclesiarchy) (Int), Scrutiny (Per) and Speak Language (High Gothic) (Int).

**Talents:** You start the game with Peer (Ecclesiarchy).

### **Mendicantine Missionary**
**Package Cost:** 100 xp

The Mendicantine Fraters are an order of Imperial preachers and confessors dedicated to a life ministering to the Imperial fold and protecting the Imperial faithful out among the stars. They are missionaries who travel whenever need or the calling of their faith takes them, be it along the famous pilgrim trails or to all but forgotten worlds on the fringes of explored space. Fiercely independent wanderers, Mendicantines take and train novices as they find them, teaching them their creed in an ad-hoc and earnest manner. This reliance on providence over doctrine is the cause of some distrust within the wider clergy, and many well-situated cardinals find them and their ministries outside of the control of "proper" Ecclesiarchical authorities to be threat. The Mendicantines, however, have the protection of ancient tradition that holds that their order was created by no less than Sebastian Thor himself and thus they enjoy the respect of the common citizenry to maintain them.

Some Inquisitors find a Mendicantine's staunch independence, strong personal faith and survival skills to be great assets in an Acolyte cleric, particularly if they themselves have Thorian leanings. Many brothers see Inquisitorial service as a chance to directly protect the Emperor's people from spiritual harm and falsehood.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You gain Common Lore (Imperium) (Int), Navigation (Surface) (Int), Scholastic Lore (Legends) (Int) and Survival (Int).

**Equipment:** Owing to your vow of poverty, halve the amount of Thrones you gain for starting money. Also, you have a social class level of Outcast for determining monthly income (see page 124 of Dark Heresy).

### **Redemptionist Firebrand**
**Cost:** 200 xp

One of the most common extremist groups, operating without official sanction on the fringes of the Ecclesiarchy, the Redemption is concerned only with the extermination of sin and the punishment of the sinner involved—preferably through the all-cleansing medium of fire. Mutants, heretics, and witches all justly fear the Redemptionist's attentions, but such is their frenzy and zeal, numerous innocents and petty criminals often end up on their pyres as well. In the Calixis Sector, the Redemption is only a real force in the underhives of Scintilla and on the frontier worlds along the Hazeroth Abyss where mutation is a common curse. However, it has recently made gains both among the survivors of war-torn Tranch and among the natives of strife-ridden Iocanthos, where its apocalyptic preaching's have found ready converts.

For all their ravings, pyromania, and complete lack of subtlety, the Redemptionists do have both fearless hatred for mankind's enemies and religious zeal in abundance both qualities that the Holy Ordos has an appetite for in its Acolytes. Redemptionist clerics brought into Inquisitorial service are likely to be the cream of the crop: smarter, more able and less openly "crazed" than their fellows; able to handle the needs of covert operations without going off on a rampage at the first sign of heresy. They are no less fanatical than any other of their kind, though, and once the time is ripe, they spare no effort or sacrifice to see the Emperor's enemies burnt for their sins.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce starting Fellowship by –5. **Skills:** You begin play with Interrogation (WP) and Intimidate (S).

**Talents:** You start with Unshakable Faith and Basic Weapon Training (Flame) or Melee Weapon Training (Chain). **Insanity Point:** You begin the game with 1d5 Insanity Points.

## <span id="page-34-0"></span>**Guardsmen: The Ashes of War**
All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Guardsmen.

### **The Mara Landing Massacre**
**Cost:** 300 xp

Mara is a wretched place, a cold world once home to a penal colony now long silent. No one goes to Mara; the space around it is quarantined, the Imperial Navy mounting infrequent patrols to keep any from straying too close. However, such accursed places seem to draw in the unwary and the unfortunate. When a navigational error and mysterious engine failure caused the troop transport Vervilix to enter the Mara quarantine zone, forcing it to land, hell was visited on those unfortunates trapped there. What happened in the five days before the Imperial Navy reached the transport remains largely unknown. Only a few hundred gaunt and haunted individuals survived out of the five thousand Guardsmen that set foot on Mara, and of those, many were later were executed for heresy or simply disappeared unable to live with what they had experienced. For those few who survived, they will never admit that they were onboard the Vervilix unless under duress. Only the sealed reports of the Ordos contain the accounts of comrades turning on one another, of walking nightmares, vile scratching and halfheard whispers at reality's fabric, and the incessant buzzing of insectile wings on the edge of the mind.

Survivors of incidents on Mara are likely to be of most interest to Radical Inquisitors who see the experience as having armed them against the worst. Moreover, they are proven survivors if nothing else, and if some shadow of Mara's terrible mystery lingers on in them, that too is worthy of attention.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics**: Increase starting Willpower by +5.

**Talents:** You start the game with Resistance (Psychic Powers).

**Corruption:** Your experiences at the massacre means that you begin the game with 1d5 Corruption Points.

**Fate Points:** You gain one additional Fate Point.

**Insanity Points:** Unhinged, you start the game with 1d10 Insanity Points.

### **Soldier of the Margin Crusade**
**Cost:** 200 xp

The Margin Crusade into the Halos Stars was launched following ratifying of the Lex Corvinus by the Great Synod Segmentum thirty years ago. This bull granted the power to raise a war of faith under the auspices of High Confessor Corvinus of Thracian Primaris and called upon the Sectors Scarus, Calixis and Ixaniad to provide the means. In the subsequent decades, the Crusade made scant progress and slowly exhausted itself, boiling away beyond the borders of Calixian space, far beyond the frontier world of Kalf. The Crusade continues to demand regiments from Lord Sector Hax, and he reluctantly supplies troops from the worlds of Calixis under the proviso that surviving veteran regiments are returned after a span of service before fresh meat is fed to the grinder. The war is a diverse and bloody affair, bogged down by the vagaries of warp travel and the tactical ineptitude of those in charge, achieving little despite thousands of lives spent and the continued admonitions of its controlling priests.

The soldiers who have returned from Corvinus's holy war are scarred veterans who have seen much in their travels, and their experiences out beyond the Emperor's light make them ideal for service with the Holy Ordos.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Characteristics:** Reduce Toughness by –3. **Skills:** You gain Awareness (Per) and Survival (Int). **Talents:** Gain the Unshakable Faith talent.

### **Tranch War Veteran**
**Cost:** 100 xp

Even by Imperial standards, the war on Tranch has been a brutal and thankless affair. What started out as a simple mutant uprising on an unimportant minor hive world quickly escalated into political collapse and a catastrophic civil conflict drawing in forces from all over the sector to contain it. Even though the war's heat has quelled now from the quarter-million strong troop landings six years ago that broke the insurrection's back, the slow burning, bitter conflict has continued on a world tainted, twisted, and brutalised by centuries of malice and festering despair. Today the efforts to rebuild the world and re-establish order continue, and fresh regiments are continually cycled-in for tours of duty to brave the fireblackened spires and the treacherous dark furnaces of the Soot Warrens. Their thankless and dangerous task is to defend the remaining citizenry, to bring Tranch slowly to heel and prevent the festering enemies of mankind from claiming the place again.

Those Guardsmen who survive their time on Tranch rarely speak openly of their experiences, but the memories never leave them. Stories of starving refugees, oppressive dark catacombs, savage attacks by scav-cannibal infiltrators, of the pale and terrible witch-kin, and of seeing friends torn apart by "twist-brutes" are all whispered among Tranch veterans in the long watches of the night.

To an Inquisitor of a militant inclination, Tranch veterans are the most common source of tough, experienced and suitably intolerant muscle.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You gain the Search (Per) skill.

**Talents:** You start the game with the Hatred (Mutants) and Light Sleeper talents.

**Insanity Points:** Gain 1d5 Insanity Points.

## <span id="page-35-0"></span>**Psykers: Translations and Revelations**  
All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Psykers.

### **A Shadow Over Thy Soul**
**Cost:** 200 xp

There is nothing more dangerous than the unguarded mind of a psyker. A nascent or unprepared psyker represents a delicious prospect to the things lurking beyond. Most psykers preyed on in this way are driven mad or possessed, and ultimately find their deaths at the Imperium's hand. A very rare few, though, triumph in their private war by their own strength of mind. Despite such a victory, most who encountered a Daemon in their emergence would be destined for execution as a moral threat by the forces of the Black Ships. No system is perfect and a fraction slip through the net. However, fewer yet survive their training and sanctioning to guard the secret shadow cast on their soul.

A psyker who has had such a blight is left unusually resistant to Chaos taint—a fact which may have attracted an Inquisitor who persecutes the corrupting forces of the warp. To them, the psyker's innate strength is a highly useful asset. The psyker, however, must be exceptionally careful to conceal the full reason for his resilience from his master. Alternatively, the psyker's past may be the very reason he or she was sought out by an Inquisitor of a more radical doctrine.

 **Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Skills:** You start the game with Forbidden Lore

(Daemonology) (Int). **Talents:** You gain the Dark Soul talent. **Corruption:** You gain 1d5 Corruption Points. **Insanity Points:** You have 1d5 Insanity Points.

### **The Guiding Light of the God-Emperor**
**Cost:** 100 xp

The only light to guide a mind out of dark places is faith. To many psykers entrenched in a deep and abiding faith in the Emperor, the gift of psychic powers is a curse that can only be controlled by faith. Mastering their powers becomes a holy process, whereby the psyker pits their faith against the temptations of an ungodly will given power, often resorting to corporal mortification to shrive themselves of their failings. Every horror faced, every agony endured strengthens their faith and armours their minds; for they know they can never weaken least they become the abomination they despise.

As likely to loath other psykers as much as they loath themselves, a righteous psyker is utterly unforgiving and relentless in the pursuit of rogue psykers and witches, and as such, is a perfect tool for the witch finders of Calixis.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Characteristics:** Reduce starting Strength by –5. **Talents:** You gain Hatred (Witches) and Insanely Faithful.

### **Living Nightmare**
**Cost:** 300 xp

There are powerful, subtle and cruel forces moving within the Imperium, some working for its salvation, while others seek its destruction. They are not the only forces at work, and there are ancient and terrible things unguessed at which predate man's first crawling steps, and beside which all of humanity are but children still. Some emergent psykers from the Calixis Sector can attest to this dark truth, having passed through unearthly horrors dwarfing those of the Black Ships they later endure. None speak of the strange devices humming with unearthly notes wielded by towering men in stark white rooms lying at the end of unending corridors. They know only that their new masters can see nothing of these strange phantasms, or indeed the depths of their minds at all. These psykers know it is better not to speak of such things, for pray the Emperor, it might have been a dream.

The unique powers of a psyker whose mind cannot be read is of obvious use to Inquisitors who face the dangers of enemy witches and renegades. There may, of course, be more complicated or darker reasons for an Inquisitor to keep such an individual near them.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase starting Willpower by +5. **Talents:** Gain Resistance (Psychic Powers).

**Insanity Points:** Start the game with 1d10 Insanity Points. **Unreadable Mind (Trait):** The deep recesses of your mind cannot be read by psychic (or other) means and any attempt to do so simply finds a fathomless void of darkness. You are completely immune to the Psychic Power, Mind Scan, as well as any similar effects or abilities.

## <span id="page-36-0"></span>**Scum: Lives Spent in Shadow** 
All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Scum.

### **The Beast Slaver**
**Home World:** Feral World, Hive World or Imperial World. 
**Cost:** 100 xp

The fighting pits and carnivora offer a bloody and popular diversion on many worlds where the rich and poor alike pay to see bloodshed and vicious creatures do battle for their sport. Such places are often magnets for all kinds of illegal activity, outcasts and wanderers, and the worst they say belong to the organisation known as the Beast House. No one knows who heads the so-called Beast House, nor do many realize quite how far it has spread through the pale underbelly of the Markayn Marches but according to some it is a secret empire built on vice and suffering. Rumor has it there are other, even more unwholesome services the Beast House can provide; who can say what dire secrets lie at its heart? There have been several attempts by Imperial agencies to penetrate the higher echelons of the Beast House—none have ended well.

Some in the Inquisition actively seek out those who have been former associates of the Beast House, however peripherally. Such an obviously dubious individual is a potential infiltrator into the darkest reaches of the underworld or simply has use as a "lightning rod" for elements the Inquisitor wishes to flush out. Their agreement makes little matter either way.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** Gain Forbidden Lore (Mutants) (Int) or Scholastics Lore (Beasts) (Int).

**Talents:** You start with Melee Weapon Training (Shock) and Peer (Underworld).

**Corruption Points:** You begin the game with 1d5 Corruption Points.
### **Cold Guild Courier**
**Home World:** Void Born.
**Cost:** 100 xp

Peerless smugglers among stars of the Calixis Sector, the Cold Guild's business is simple: transportation. Its membership is made up of anonymous crewmen, corrupt officials, petty merchants and even a few ships' captains, and its history goes back centuries. The Cold Guild's existence is something of an open secret, and though they may be outlawed by the Arbites and publicly decried by Chartist Captains, they persist, in no small part, because of their usefulness to many powerful groups and hidden factions. Of course, the Guild itself plays no favorites. Rarely bothered with petty contraband, the Guild specializes high-profit, high-risk cargos such as illegal arms and contraband, but for a price. It can be hired to move anything from people on the run, to small cargoes that cannot even pass through more conventional smuggling means. Be it the hunted renegade noble travelling as a corpse on a barge of the dead, to the vilest of most proscribed delights hidden in a fallen priest's aquila chain, the Guild can always find a way to make the crossing, and cares nothing for the consequences if their employers cannot meet their steep price.

Many Inquisitors, who have need of infiltrators and couriers to acquire the highest grade of information, find former Guilders to be great assets. In the hunt for proscribed and dangerous items, an expert eye for hiding places is also extremely useful. Though valued for their unique skills, some are reluctant to recruit from these groups, not just for their unsavoury pasts, but because the long periods of travelling in cryonic suspension or in cramped holds, as is oft-required by the Guild, take their toll on the health of their agents.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase Perception by +5, but reduce Toughness by –5.

**Talents:** You gain Concealed Cavity, Peer (Void Born), and Talented (Concealment) at the start of the game.

### **The Brotherhood of Thollos**
**Home World:** Hive World or Imperial World. 
**Cost:** 200 xp

Muscle for hire is not hard to come by in the sector, but few can lean on a reputation as polished as that of the Brotherhood of Thollos. Once recruited only from the Infernis gangers of Gunmetal City, the Brotherhood has spread like a stain across the sector with Sibellan narco-gangers and other hardened types from the gutters of the sector's hives swelling its ranks. The Brotherhood offers some of the most professional, brutal and expensive stubjacks, heavies, thieves and bagmen that can be chartered on this side of the Halo Stars. Discerning in the jobs they take, the Brotherhood knows better than to anger the great powers of the noble houses and Adepta, but consider everybody and everything else fair game. Not all of those within the Brotherhood are mercenary hirelings; they also number talented fixers, information gleaners and black marketeers among their ranks. It is in the brutality underpinning organised crime that most of their members excel.

Scum who have learned their trade with the Brotherhood tend to consider themselves "professionals" in the criminal trade, and are used to hard knocks, sudden violence and betrayal. Most also possess a wide network of former employers, old contacts and rivals, all of which may be useful to their Inquisitor.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Increase starting Weapon Skill and Toughness each by +3. Reduce starting Fellowship by –5.

**Talents:** You begin the game with the Street Fighting and Peer (Underworld) talents.

## **Tech-priests: Cults of the Machine**
All of the following Background Packages are intended for use with Tech-Priests.

### **The Disciples of Thule**
**Home World:** Forge World or Void Born. 
**Cost:** 100 xp

If the Adeptus Mechanicus explorators operating out of the Calixis Sector can be said to have an overall leader or spiritual guide, it is the Archmagos Paracelsus Thule. Many centuries old, Thule's fleet, which disappears out beyond the edge of mankind's domain for decades at a time, is vast and many explorator Adepts and Magos have served under his tutelage over the years, passing on his teachings to their juniors in turn. Thule's instruction centres on identifying pre-Imperial human technologies and sets the goal of finding the relics of mankind's glorious past above all other concerns and risks. This lack of caution makes Thule and those following him something of a radical faction within the Cult Mechanicus, but a powerful and influential one in the Calixis Sector.

Thule's disciples centre their studies entirely on analysis and study, valuing the acquisition of knowledge above all other concerns. They distain physical confrontation and are often so wrapped up in cogitation they fail to notice what is in front of them. Some Inquisitors appreciate this curiosity in their tech-priests, finding it preferable to the narrow thinking and conservatism many others of their kind demonstrate, even though curiosity almost always carries its own dangers.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character: **Characteristics:** Reduce starting Weapon Skill and Perception each by –5.

**Skills:** You gain Common Lore (Machine Cult) (Int), Evaluate (Int), Forbidden Lore (Archaeotech) (Int), Logic (Int), and Scholastic Lore (Cryptology) (Int) as bonus Skills.

### **The Divine Light of Sollex**
**Home World:** Forge World.
**Cost:** 300 xp

The weapon-mystics of the Cult of Sollex form a sect of the Adeptus Mechanicus based on the minor forge world of Haddrak in the Drusus Marches. The sect has expanded beyond its world of origin enjoying adherents among the Magos Militant of the Lathes and the tech-priests assigned to Battlefleet Calixis. The Sollex are a warlike sect who study the art of destruction and specialise in the occult mysteries of photon and laser, finding divine wisdom in a fractured spectrum of light. Aside from producing particularly powerful and advanced weapons and holo systems, the work of Sollex is reputed to have been put to more esoteric and hidden ends, and their secrets are well-guarded, even compared to the rest of the Cult Mechanicus.

A Sollex tech-priest may have been selected for Inquisitorial service owing to an above average experience of warfare, arms and hostile contact with the alien. They often seem even more inhuman than their fellows, far more fanatical and militant in their adherence to the mystical dogma of the Cult Mechanicus, and utterly unforgiving of those who blaspheme against the Machine God.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Characteristics:** Reduce starting Fellowship by –5.

**Skills:** You start the game with Ciphers (Secret Society— Sollex) (Int), Common Lore (Machine Cult) (Int), Demolition (Int), and Scholastic Lore (Tactica Imperialis) (Int). You also gain a +10 bonus on all Tech-Use Tests made when working on or with laser or holo devices.

**Talents:** You gain Hatred (Tech-heretics) and Unshakable Faith.

**Insanity Points:** You begin play with 1d5 Insanity Points.

### **Malygrisian Tech Heresy**
**Home World:** Forge World or Void Born.
**Package Cost:** 200 xp

The infamous renegade Magos Umbra Malygris, known to Inquisitorial records as Malygris the Damned, led a widespread and insidious tech-heretic cult that flourished in the Malfian sub-sector three centuries ago. Many great crimes against both Imperial Law and the Cult Mechanicus's own doctrines were laid against him, including the fashioning of forbidden silica animus, corpse vivication and the unleashing of experimental viralstrains on unsuspecting populations to test their effects. Eventually the renegade was tracked down and he and his followers destroyed in bloody confrontation with a joint Inquisitorial-Mechanicus purgation. Since then his works and researches have been brutally, but not entirely successfully, suppressed. Despite the sanctions against it, Malygris's lore persists, kept alive in no small part by those tech-priests tasked to hunt down rebellious members of the Mechanicus itself, much in the same way as the more Radical factions of the Holy Ordos seek to turn the tools of the arch-enemy against its own followers, risking destruction at the hands of their own kind.

A tech-priest inducted into the Inquisition who has absorbed Malgrisian data walks a deadly tightrope. On the one hand, he is armed with knowledge of occult science few others can match, making him a very able opponent for the dark powers of heresy and corruption. On the other hand, such tech-priests already stand half-steeped in shadow, and are thus in peril for their very souls.

**Effects**
Apply all of the following changes to your character:

**Skills:** You begin play with Ciphers (Malygris Codex) (Int), Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Int), Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Int), Scholastic Lore (Legend) (Int) and Scholastic Lore (Numerology) (Int).

**Corruption:** You start play with 1d5 Corruption Points.

**Insanity Points:** You are Unhinged and begin with 1d5 Insanity Points.

**Note:** In absorbing this knowledge, you have jeopardised more than your life. If the source of your knowledge is somehow proved, you are in danger from elements of the Cult Mechanicus itself.
