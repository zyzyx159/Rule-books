# <span id="page-170-0"></span>Chapter VI: War Zones 

*"Right you lot, I'm to brief you on war zone etiquette—so listen up! It's real simple… Do what you're told, keep your weapon clean and your head down. Oh, and don't touch nothing."*

— Sergeant "Brassneck" Hobbs, Scintillian 23rd.

I f there is one unifying thread that binds the Imperium together throughout its millennia of existence, it is war. The Imperium was built and is sustained through bloody crusades and eternal conflict, and the Calixis Sector is no exception. Despite its reputation as a civilized though remote sector, Calixis too has its share of combat zones. To travel through the sector is to see numerous conflicts, ranging from the small-scale skirmishes of rebellious workers and factions to planetwide carnage caused by xenos incursion or infection. The Hammer of the Emperor, as His Imperial Guard forces are commonly called, is indeed an apt name as the warfare practiced by Imperial forces is as brutal and unforgiving as a hammer strike to the face. I

Many conflicts are but brief flashes measured in days or months, others can last for decades or longer. Ignorance is a virtue, with the most conflicts going unknown to the toiling multitudes of the sector, their knowledge limited to rousing propaganda and scant rumour brought back by battle-weary troopers whose dreams are the endless nightmares of men who have seen too much.

#### **Arming for Battle** Arming for Battle

The Departmento Munitorum is, among other things, responsible for providing munitions, war machines, armaments and other support material vital to maintain Imperial Guard forces and their ability to prosecute war. This vast logistical enterprise stretches across the Imperium, and without it the Hammer of the Emperor would simply fall apart. In the Calixis Sector, the Munitorum's headquarters can be found on Scintilla, where legions of administrata cogitate and sequester contracts and orders with forge worlds, fanes and hives to supply their needs, thus ensuring the continued security of Calixis space.

#### **Munitorum Standard**

As the Departmento Munitorum is the largest weapons production and procurement agency in the galaxy, it is no wonder that their products have become the standard for the Imperium. Whilst there are countless variations of the basic lasgun for example, almost all function in a fairly common manner with the standard nineteen-megathule power pack. Without such standardisation the Imperial Guard could not effectively fight across the wide expanse of Imperial space. Weapons as described in the Dark Heresy core rulebook are for the most part examples of this Munitorum standard, and exist in great numbers; there are thousands of variant patterns used as well by Guardsmen and other Imperial agents of course. Many of these are captured combat trophies, unauthorised battlefield modifications, or weapons from the hives where such near-endless customisations abound. Usually it is up to each Guardsman to procure nonstandard ammunitions, either through battlefield scrounging or side dealings with Munitorum field officials. Such extra work is usually a fair trade, as, for most, having such a weapon is what differentiates the veteran trooper from a dead one.

#### <span id="page-171-0"></span>**A Sector at War**

Like almost all sectors of the Imperium, the Calixis Sector is home to war, with dozens of planets and systems at any given time seeing armed conflict. Below are just a few of the more notable actions within the sector.

Fydae has long been a troublesome system, and ongoing skirmishes have been running on and off for nearly 200 years against disparate pirate clans whose strongholds move as swiftly as do their vessels. All of the habitable planets in the region have been witness to scenes of open combat, with Imperial Guard regiments supplementing local Planetary Defence Forces in an attempt to pin down some of the larger and more cavalier pirate factions.

47 Kapella within the Kapella System, near the Blackshine Nebula, is in the process of Imperial pacification as Imperial Guard regiments from the Secundus 21st Expeditionary Force and Brontian 5th (Longknives) slowly complete mopping up operations against a civilian insurrection that overtook most of the planetary government, killing Lord Belin XVIII and virtually all of the leadership. The tattered and blackened remnants of Vunox are scant reminders of the once acclaimed spires of the hive.

A normally quiet and productive system spinward of the Markayn Marches, Gelmiro's main tithe planets are now desolate wastelands, the home of abominable mutations and crazed zealots. An uprising, lead by heretical followers of the insane cleric Anolian Hesh, ignited stolen atomics on Gelmiro Primus, Gelmiro Secundus and Tertius destroying nearly all of the system's key military assets. Investigating forces were greeted with attacks from planetary defences and traitor naval ships, and it was only after intense orbital battles that land forces could be deployed. Now in its third year, the effort to suppress those responsible has stagnated into a slogging battle of trench warfare. Imperial authorities continue to investigate how Hesh's followers managed to bring an entire system down.

The Purge of Avitohol will be a black mark in Calixis's history, with mile-high plumes of flame and smoke still rising daily over the ruined promethium refineries of that world situated in the Periphery. Elements of the Tranch 14th have been assigned to track down and eliminate an undisclosed xenos presence in the area.

Lastly there is the mystery of Tsade II. Located in the Josian Reach, Tsade II is an agri-world whose tithe includes sheef-corn (a staple ingredient for many foodstuffs processed to feed the hives of Fenksworld). The first indication of something amiss came when tithe-collection vessels, on their never-ending circuit of the system, approached only to be met with vox silence. The collectors found the planet reduced to craters and rubble, and space-based facilities torn to pieces. The few survivors could only gibber of "lights in the sky" and became violent when brought out of their underground bunkers. That an attack of such magnitude and speed could occur is disquieting to say the least and elements of Battlefleet Calixis have been despatched to investigate.

The following weapons see the heaviest use on the front lines of the Imperium.

#### **Bolt Weapons Garm Pattern Service Bolt Pistol** Bolt Weapons

#### **Class:** Pistol (Bolt)

Often brandished by Commissars, these large and intimidating weapons are designed to be carried unholstered and in easy sight of their charges. All Guardsmen, regardless of rank, know that their Commissar is watching their actions and is ready to grant summary execution to those found wanting in the Emperor's eyes. Service pistols are a constant reminder of what awaits them if they fail in their duty.

#### **Mars Pattern MarkII Scourge**

#### **Boltgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Bolt)

Favoured by the warrior-sisters of the Order of the Ebon Chalice at the Abbey of Dawn on Iocanthos, the Scourge comes equipped with a sarissa as the bayonet fixture. The sharp spiked attachment can easily rip open any heretic in the hands of a power-armoured Adepta Sororitas fighter. When used in close combat, a Mars Pattern boltgun counts as a monoaxe.

#### **Flamer Weapons Heavy Flamer** Flamer Weapons

#### **Class:** Heavy (Flamer)

Large and heavy, these weapons require a crew of two men, one to aim and carry the barrel, and the other saddled with the delightful job of having a large tank of promethium strapped to their back. Heavy Flamers are ideal for immolating entire swaths of enemy with each shot, and serve as an effective terror weapon.

#### **Voss Pattern Nightfire Flamer Class:** Basic (Flamer)

Purely a terror weapon, the Nightfire uses refined promethium blended with toxic chemicals. Used only by specialist assault troops in full protective gear, it not only burns but also poisons the surrounding air with noxious smoke. Foes who manage to survive the initial flames find themselves gasping for air once the toxins reach their lungs.

# **Las Weapons** Las Weapons**Voss Pattern**

*"Funniest thing I ever did see. Big guy comes a roaring over the trench waving this huge chain axe around. I get a quick shot, las in the belly, but he's sill standin'. He rears back to swing and the axe gets chunked up in the mud and flakboard. Stuck good, ain't comin' out. So he turns around to use both hands to try and haul it out. Still nothing. I'm starin' fit to bust waiting for the blow, till finally I get me' wits and pops him in the back of the head."*  — Trooper Gavin Calmor, 21st Artor Artillery Brigade.

#### **Triplex Pattern "Fury" Assault**

#### **Laspistol**

**Class:** Pistol (Las)

This rare variant is most often utilised by elite assault squads and the Fury is the ideal weapon when facing a horde of foes. They fire in short bursts, designed to clear away enemies without slowing the advance.

#### **Voss Pattern Hellgun and Hellpistol**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las) or Pistol (Las)

Utilising advanced techniques of manufacture and internal gyro-stabilisation, high power "hellguns" are the chosen weapons of the elite Inquisitorial Stormtroopers and Imperial Guard grenadier forces. Costly and difficult to manufacture, the primary source for these weapons in the Calixis Sector is the Takara Fane of Gunmetal City.

Hellguns are far more energy-hungry than standard las weapons and fed from power capacitor backpack units. They may use standard las weapon charge packs, but consume four charges per shot.

#### **Laslocks**

**Class:** Basic (Las)

Sometimes known as "blaze guns" or "las-muskets", no two of these cobbled together and ill-made weapons are ever quite the same. Often found in the hands of desperate and poorly equipped insurgents or renegades, las-locks are usually scratch built or modifications of antique or damaged las rifles brought back into service by scav-workshops and heretek forges. Laslocks's jury-rigged capacitors are temperamental things at best, but still potent, firing a more powerful discharge than that of a standard lasgun.

#### **Military Construction**

Common construction materials are used in most Imperial fortifications and military postings, mainly due to their simplicity of manufacture and the standardisation of fabrication technologies.

**Plasteel:** The strongest and most expensive, plasteel is used in both personal and vehicle armour. It is very durable, relatively lightweight, and can be formed into an endless variety of shapes and textures.

**Rockcrete:** Mostly made from native stone ground up and mixed with binding agents to form heavy, thick slabs used in walls and flooring. It is cheap and easy to create.

**Plascrete:** This material forms most prefabricated habs and Imperial stations. It combines the ease of manufacture of rockcrete with most of the durability of plasteel.

**Flakboard:** Used in many military installations, flakboard provides a quick means of protecting interior walls and repairing damage. It is sturdy and easy to construct, and can keep a fortification patched-up until more lasting materials can be procured.

**Proximity Alarm:** These detect motion and/or sound, and alert of incoming dangers such as ground-based attacks. Most set off a horrendous noise, but others can use silent or visual alerts linked to portable or emplaced receptor units.

**Razor Wire:** A decidedly crude yet effective way to protect an installation, razor wire sees extensive use in both war and urban zones.

#### **Weapons of the Astartes**

*"Look upon this with awe. This is a holy sword, given to us alone by the Emperor to declaim His will and bring the divine fire of retribution upon those who would forsake His word. Honour it daily within your prayers, for it is yours and yours alone."* — Boltgun Orientation, 5th Company Captain Vestanek.

The mighty Adepus Astartes are superhuman in every way, and so too are their weapons. Each is oversized, specially designed for their great strength and enlarged physiques. This is especially true of bolter weapons such as boltguns and bolt pistols. Massive and reinforced like their users, even the ammunition clips are sheathed in protective wards and armour, with hand-grips larger than any human hand can manage and a weight that would require most humans to use a support bracing. Indeed a human trying to fire such a weapon would likely suffer recoil of such strength that it would rip their arm from its socket. Space Marine boltguns are simply not something seen outside of their sacred ranks.

"Mortal" bolters are a rank apart and are so designed that mere humans can wield them. Designed with smaller grips and lighter construction, these bolters do not have the same capacity for slaughter as the Astartes versions, yet can easily cut a man in two. Supplied by the Departmento Munitorum to Imperial Guard forces throughout the galaxy, even these pale shadows of Marine bolters are rare trophies to be passed down from generation to generation.

#### **Mars Pattern Mark III Short Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Standard issue for many Imperial Guard regiments across the Imperium since M.36, the blocky MK III lasgun is a remarkably robust and easy to use weapon. Legendarily able to stand up to any amount of abuse and keep firing, the "Guardsman's Friend" as the Uplifting Primer calls it, is respected over more powerful shoulder arms for its practicality and extreme reliability in almost any condition. The Mars pattern is produced in great numbers on Scintilla and Malfi and is the standard armament of most Calixian Guard regiments.

#### **Mars Pattern Mark IV Command**

#### **Laspistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (Las)

Presented to officers when they attain company commands, these are high-powered weapons designed for carefully placed shots at longer ranges. They have an extended barrel and are slightly heavier than standard service pistols.

#### **Multi-Laser**

#### **Class:** Heavy (Las)

A vehicle-mounted weapon, commonly found on the Chimera APC and the Sentinel Wealker, a multilaser's rapid-pulse configuration allows a multitude of shots to be fired in bursts. While much less powerful than lascannon, they offer a high sustained rate of fire that makes them excellent as suppression and antipersonnel weapons.

#### **Roth Pattern Lightning Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

An unusual pattern, the Roth "Lightning" has its ammunition plug set behind the trigger grip, allowing for a extended collimation barrel which provides greater ranges without increasing the overall size. Owing to their relative rarity, these weapons are often restricted to "sharpshooter" light infantry regiments and many are further modified into long las sniper rifles.

#### **Stormfront Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

The use of this local variant of the standard Kantrael pattern lasgun by the widely renowned Brontian regiments has secured this weapon's "cold steel" reputation in Calixian military circles. The Stormfront lasgun features an integral bayonet and a wooden stock as part of its solid construction, and the rifle is balanced for the close-quarters fighting at which the Brontians excel. The Stormfront counts as a spear when used in melee.

#### **Lasburst Twin Lasgun**

#### **Class:** Basic (Las)

Considered old even among the ancient nature of most Imperial weapons, twin lasguns are a rare sight on the battlefield. First produced millennia ago, their design was never perfected as other patterns soon superseded the Lasburst's unreliable nature. Still some appear on battlefields, either as ancient devices or low-grade versions manufactured in lesser munitions factories. While not as dependable as a regular lasgun, Lasbursts offer a much stronger fire rate by literally doubling the normal firepower.

#### **Launchers Auxiliary Grenade Launcher** Launchers

#### **Class:** Basic (Launcher)

A small single-shot version of the regular grenade launcher fitted onto another ranged weapon such as a lasgun, allowing the user to either fire a single grenade instead of firing as normal. The added weight and cumbersome nature means that most users rarely bother to reload the launcher once it is expended. An auxiliary grenade launcher can be fitted to any basic weapon adding the weight as listed in its profile. A character using a weapon with an auxiliary grenade launcher can choose to either fire the launcher or the weapon it is attached to in their Turn but not both at once.

#### **Disposable Launcher**

#### **Class:** Basic (Launcher)

This weapon is popular with PDF forces as it is simple to use and requires no loading or reloading. These weapons normally come pre-loaded with a single frag or krak missile. Some disposable launchers come loaded with rocket-propelled frag or krak grenades instead—these versions are half the normal cost.

#### **Missile Launcher**

#### **Class:** Heavy (Launcher)

The most powerful launcher weapon, they fire a variety of specialised rounds at long distances. Each missile is fitted with stabilization and guidance systems to aid their accuracy.

#### **Melta Weapons Multi-Melta** Melta Weapons

#### **Class:** Heavy (Melta)

The largest melta weapon and usually only found within the ranks of the Astartes or on Imperial vehicles. This huge weapon can fire in much longer ranges and creates a larger blast area, cooking several square meters at a time. It also generates much more heat than its smaller cousins, and most users must insulate themselves with protective clothing or armour.

#### **Thermal Lance**

**Class:** Heavy (Melta)

A more refined melta weapon, a thermal lance uses additional magnetic containment beams to guide the superheated flow through an extended barrel, resulting in less dispersion and tighter control. It is often used for precise cutting, but doubles nicely as a weapon for slicing through armour and bulkheads in focused cuts.

#### **Voss Pattern Mark III Ultimo**

#### **Meltagun**

**Class:** Basic (Melta)

Somewhat larger than the standard melta gun, it fires a more accurate and directed heat beam. The longer barrel provides for added directional containment to reduce dispersal, but at the cost of reduced firepower.

#### **Plasma Weapons Mars Pattern Mark III Sunfury Assault Plasma Gun** Plasma Weapons

**Class:** Basic (Plasma)

A high-power weapon issued to Imperial Guard units facing heavily armoured foes. The Sunfury can spit out plasma bolts capable of destroying even light vehicles with ease, although its rate of fuel consumption is high. Its reputation grew in the Calixis Sector when it was used great effect during the Meritates Uprising along the Ixaniad border several hundred years ago against the augmetic reavers of the savage Meritech clans.

#### **Plasma Blaster**

#### **Class:** Basic (Plasma)

A unique variant crafted as a combi-weapon, it incorporates two plasma guns which, when fired together, give twice the effective damage, but also at a higher risk to the user. The guns share the same fuel canisters, lowering the weight of the weapon but keeping the number of shots it can fire to roughly the same as a regular plasma gun.

#### **Plasma Cannon**

**Class:** Heavy (Plasma)

Most often seen on Imperial vehicles, a plasma cannon requires a large separate fuel container. It can also be fired in maximal mode, which consumes six shots worth of fuel but provides a blast of solar heat on impact, creating a fireball of stellar temperatures.

#### **Solid Projectile Weapons** Solid Projectile Weapons

#### **Alcher Mark IV Combat Autogun**

#### **Class:** Basic (SP)

This weapon is popular with PDF forces across the sector, where the simple setting (one shot or full automatic) fits better with the generally less well-trained soldiers. The larger magazine size helps keep up with the higher rate of shooting.

#### **Assault Cannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (SP)

Assault cannons are equipped with six rapidly rotating barrels in a gatling-style configuration firing diamantine tipped shells. The barrels wear out quickly due to the intense heat generated by the internal motor that spins them, and normally require replacements after each mission to prevent jamming or catastrophic failure.

Assault cannons are nasty for their sheer rate of fire that lets them progressively "chew" through targets.

#### **Autocannon**

#### **Class:** Heavy (SP)

An autocannon is a very brutal weapon, noisy and hard to control in action, and requires a team of two operators (firer and loader) for effective use. Autocannons use cased, explosive shells fired at a high rate to destroy their target. On the battlefield they provide excellent infantry support.

#### **Dorcas Pattern Trophy Stub**

#### **Automatic**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Awarded by many Calixian regiments as a commendation for the lower ranks, pistols of this type were first taken as battlefield trophies during the Second Insurrection of Cantus centuries ago. Relics from that fabled war are highly valued, but most Guard veterans are content with a more modern copy, awarded as they are for valour in the face of the foe.

#### **Orthlack Mark IVThollos**

#### **Autopistol**

#### **Class:** Pistol (SP)

Produced by the Fane of Orthlack in Gunmetal City, the "Thollos" or "Tholl" has long been a popular backup weapon for line officers in Calixian Guard units, who favour its stopping power over most regulation sidearms. Indeed, so common has the practice of carrying one become that many old military families often present their sons and daughters with a commemoratively inscribed Thollos to mark their first commission.

#### **Grenades and Missiles** Grenades and Missiles

*"Throne, that's a pretty sight. OK, prep for second det on my mark."*

> — Lieutenant Mox Travellian, 1st Company Demolitions Squad, 87th Aubin Grenadiers.

#### **Frag Missile**

This is a heavier version of the frag grenade designed primarily as an anti-personnel weapon. Frag missiles can only be used in missile launchers.

#### **Inferno Thermal Grenade**

These devices explode with a shower of molten metal as their incendiary fuel ignites. They are not as powerful as a melta-bomb and thus cannot burn though most armour, but are useful for melting down simple barricades and doors or for starting fires. These grenades can be purchased to be used either by hand (thrown) or in grenade or RPG launchers. They can also be found in missile form.

#### **Krak Missile**

Used as tank-killers, there is little that can survive a direct hit from a krak missile. Krak missiles can only be used in missile launchers.

## **Gunmetal Solid Mark III Frag**

#### **Grenade**

Gunmetal is known for producing a slightly heavier version grenade, ideal where a larger blast is needed. These grenades can be purchased to be used either by hand (thrown) or in grenade or RPG launchers.

#### **Stun Grenade**

Designed to incapacitate and disorient rather than kill, a stun grenade's concussive effect, thunderous noise and bright flash is highly effective and usually causes no lasting injury. Anyone caught in a stun grenade's blast must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or become Stunned for 1d5 Rounds. Photo-visors and sealed armour provide a +20 bonus to this Test.

#### **Explosives Det-Cord and Det-Tape** Explosives

Det-cord and det-tape are the two most common types of timer material, often used in conjunction with tube-charges. The delay is set by either peeling back the tape or cutting the cord to the desired length. Both can be used as a low-grade explosive material in an emergency, inflicting 1d5 X Damage for every one kilogram used with a blast radius of twice its weight in kilograms.

#### **Fyceline**

A chemical used in many standard Imperial explosives, it is mined from rare ores and its production often becomes the primary tithe for many planets. Refined fyceline can be used to fashion crude explosives. Fyceline explosives inflict 1d10+5 X Damage for every kilogram used in their construction and have a blast radius of five times their weight in kilograms.

#### **Cressin Pattern Limpet Mine**

A less powerful and less expensive directional explosive similar to the melta bomb, it is applied directly to the target structure and focuses the blast against it. The resulting explosion is more powerful than a regular krak detonation. When a limpet mine explodes, it deals 4d10 X Damage to anything within one metre, with a Penetration of 8.

#### **Mines**

Mines can be made from pretty much any of the explosives and grenades listed here, and use triggers from simple pressure-sensors to advanced bioscanners. Most are placed just under the ground and are designed to explode underground, whilst others spring into the air when triggered to maximize shrapnel damage. Imperial Guard troopers are trained in using frag grenades to fashion improvised mines and booby traps. Only careful observation of your surroundings (or a good mine-detector) can pick out a well hidden mine.

#### **Melta Bomb**

Designed to be manually fixed to their target with mag-adhesives, melta bombs detonate with a charge of intense heat similar in effect to a melta weapon, and are ideal for destroying bulkheads, vehicle hulls and other heavily armoured targets. Imperial melta bombs are roughly domed in shape but heavy and unwieldy and not designed to be thrown. When a melta bomb explodes it deals 6d10 E Damage to anything within two metres with a Penetration of 12. Anything surviving must take an Agility Test or catch on fire.

#### **Promethium**

Petrochem-based liquid fuel, promethium is the jelly-like substance used to power flamer weapons. It can also be used to create anti-personnel explosives and bombs as it is highly flammable. Promethium explosives inflict 2d10 E Damage for every kilogram used in their construction and have a blast radius of four times their weight in kilograms. In addition, anyone caught in the radius of a promethium explosion must make an Agility Test or catch on fire.

#### **Weapon Upgrades Duplus Ammo Clips** Weapon Upgrades

Double-ended ammunition clips designed to shorten reloading time. Users simply flip the clip over when one side is exhausted. The clip is effectively two clips attached to each other and requires two clips worth of ammo to fill. A weapon with these special clips reduces their loading time by half (thus a weapon that takes two Full Actions to reload becomes a single Full Action). Normally only utilised by officers—troopers finding tape just as effective to holding to clips together, and a lot cheaper!

**Upgrades:** Any Basic, Pistol, Solid Projectile or Las weapon with a removable clip.

#### **Forearm Weapon Mounting**

As the name suggests, these heavy gauntlets allow for a single ranged weapon to be mounted along the arm, with specific hand movement triggering the weapon. This upgrade allows the user to keep both hands free. A weapon in a forearm mount functions as listed except that its range is reduced by 30%.

**Upgrades:** Any Primitive, Las, Solid Projectile, Bolt or Melta pistol.

#### **The Tranch War**

A grimy and relatively minor hive world, Tranch's only lasting fame is a slow burning and vicious civil conflict that, despite countless lives lost, shows no sign of abating. Tranch's economy before the war was sustained in part by a sizable population of mutants utilised as slave labour in the Soot Warrens of the furnace levels. Its masters, the Oligarchs of Tranch, were pitiless and sadistic rulers with a history of brutal repression. When a portion of the mutant population rose up, few dreamed it would spark a conflict that would spread to engulf the entire planet and leave more than a billion dead. As initial policing actions by the Oligarchs' brutal enforcers failed, and battles boiled over from the warrens to the hab levels, it became clear that the mutants had powerful help and organisation on their side. Led by the Shrouds, a cabal of powerful rogue psykers and witches, the mutant's onslaught was further aided by the terrorist attacks of hidden Chaos cults that struck without warning in the upper hives, sowing confusion and terror in the spires. As the situation rapidly worsened, the Oligarchs' grip on power began to slip and, giving in to fear, they redeployed troops away from the mid-hive levels in order to protect their own interests—with disastrous results. The mutants surged up from the depths and slaughtered thousands. Soon the Oligarchs faced a second popular revolt by the masses they had all but abandoned. Tranch descended almost overnight into anarchy, and as news and lawlessness spread, nearby worlds, many long suffering from woes of their own, threatened to do the same.

Seeing a world under his domain slipping unexpectedly into Chaos and with others threatening to follow suit, a bloody lesson was clearly needed and Lord Hax himself personally gave the order to raise regiments to "Crush this foul and treacherous vipers' nest in our blessed Emperor's dominion." Regiments were raised from Scintilla, Malfi, Iocanthos and elsewhere to descend upon beleaguered Tranch, accompanied by elements from the Holy Ordos who sought to decapitate the tainted rebellion's warp-twisted leadership. The war that followed is considered to be the most brutal in living memory in the Calixis Sector. Although the grip of the Shroud Council was swiftly broken and the mutants' unity shattered, the war did not end, and, instead of a single mutant army to face, there were now countless numbers of rebel factions, mutant bands, cults and scavengers picking over the burned out and shattered hives to contend with—with no easy victory in sight. The purging campaign took nearly five years of inglorious and dirty warfare. Afterward, Tranch was left a seething pit of conflict and discord, and many of those "saved" now relegated to the status of empty-eyed refugees eking out what living they could in the ruins.

Now classified as "officially pacified", the Calixian Guard regiments who are routinely rotated through deployments on Tranch still take the brunt of the slowly simmering conflict and must face a thankless war of ambushes, desperate victims, booby traps, atrocities and ever present terror. Tranch today is still a militarised zone, administered as a fiefdom of the powers of the Malfian sub-sector. Large-scale efforts to recolonise and restart the world's industry have only been partially successful, and whole hive spires, not to mention much of the Soot Warrens, are still lawless battlegrounds—the domain of rogue mutants and worse.

#### **Targeter**

Expensive, heavy and rarely used except by elite forces, a targeter uses a variety of guidance cogitators and omni-sights to improve accuracy. These upgrades are normally hard-wired into a specific weapon for maximum efficiency. Commonly viewed as adding to the weapon's machine-spirit, they create an even closer bond between gunner and gun. A targeter grants a +10 bonus on all Ballistic Skill Tests made with the weapon.

**Upgrades:** Any Las, Solid Projectile, Bolt or Heavy weapon.

#### **Tripod and Bipods**

These attachments are for heavier weapons or those using integral ammunition canisters rather than a backpackmounted source (such as plasma guns or meltaguns). Resting the weapon on the ground increases accuracy but sacrifices mobility, thus making them more common in static defence lines. Bipods and tripods allow a weapon to be braced anywhere there is a reasonably flat surface. A weapon braced on a bipod has a 90-degree fire arc while one on a tripod has a 180-degree arc. Bracing with a tripod requires a Full Action. Bracing with a bipod requires a Half Action.

**Upgrades:** Any Basic or Heavy weapon.

*"No, bring your blade up to parry, then across. Try again. No, that's totally wrong! Ten lashes for getting blood on my uniform. Medic!"*

— Corporel Linus Razreil, Drill Instructor, Mordian

21st Expeditionary Force.

#### **Combat Knife**

**Class:** Melee (Primitive)

These oversized bladed weapons are almost to the size of a short sword. Each has a heavy, straight-edged blade designed to cut flesh as well as puncture light armour, and can be affixed to most basic weapons as a bayonet.

#### **Guard Shield**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Several guard regiments use modern shields as part of their combat style, particularly the Wasteland Legionnaires who often advance through hostile areas with camouflaged shields. They are generally made from quality plasteel plates, lighter than they would appear. Some even have small visors of glassteel so that the user can peer out without sacrificing protection. Guard shields can provide cover for the user concealing all of their body should they choose. As cover, a guard shield provides 6 Armour Points.

#### **Trophy Knife**

#### **Class:** Melee (Primitive)

Many fighters use the remains of their kill to fashion a memento of the action, and xenos fighters are no exception. A thriving secondary business goes on in many regiments where claws and teeth from alien creatures are removed and honed into valuable weapons. Each is a unique creation representing some of the monstrous races that have threatened the sector, some even unknown by scholars. They serve to show off the battlefield prowess of a warrior to their fellow troopers.

#### **Power Fist**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

Rather than encasing an edged weapon with a power field, the energy field here is instead used to disrupt material in a more violent fashion. Worn as a hugely oversized glove, when the mechanically augmented fist strikes or clenches its target it can tear open the heaviest armour. Unprotected enemies simply erupt in a shower of ruined flesh, as if a grenade had exploded inside them. Power fists are more common as part of power armour suits where the massive power requirements can be met by integral energy packs, but some elite Imperial forces and high-ranking officers also use them with the aid of backpack power sources.

#### **Waller Pattern Mark VI Power Longsword**

#### **Class:** Melee (Power)

As the name suggests these blades are longer than normal power swords, requiring two hands to wield effectively. They are popular among the Brontian Longknives.

# <span id="page-181-0"></span>Armour Armour

*"Your faith is indeed admirable Confessor. But I'll keep my helmet on."*

— Captain Vladmir Gatt, 115th Yostin Royal Guards.

#### **Windrider Carapace Scale Armour**

An odd mix of armour styles, this uses small diamond shaped armplas plates bound together in overlapping sections, forming a flexible covering that is less restrictive than normal carapace armour. The officers of the Lacustan Windriders favour this armour for the extra mobility it affords, as well as its savage appearance.

#### **Flak Greatcoat**

Many Imperial Guard and PDF officers favour these heavy garments, as they offer protection against colder climates as well as enemy fire. Stylish as well as functional, they are also favourites among civilian fighters as well.

#### **Lidhl Light Power Armour**

Despite its heavily ornamented and impressive visage, this armour it is at the low end of protective value. It sees the most widespread use among the officers of the Scintillan Guard, for it allows a great deal of customisation to better display their heraldry and accomplishments.

#### **Refractor Field**

Although still very rare, refractor fields are perhaps the commonest form of force field defence available in the Imperium. Their creation is a closely guarded secret, a relic of a more "powerful" age. Sometimes employed by Imperial Guard officers of high rank, the wealthy scions of noble houses or awarded as a mark of great distinction to senior Adepta, refractor fields take the form of elaborate gorgets or belt units that generate an all but invisible impedance field a short distance away from the body which refracts and defects energy.

A refractor field generator is a kind of force field defence. Anytime that the wearer is struck by high velocity Impact, Energy (gunfire, etc.) Explosive (bolt weapons) attacks; they may roll 2d10 and reduce the Damage dealt by the sum of the dice. Should the wearer roll double ones ("11"), the attack bypasses the field completely (do not reduce the Damage). If the wearer rolls double tens ("00"), the field overloads and the power cell burns out and must be replaced (Damage is reduced by 20).

Refractor fields of this type are ineffective against very close range or slow moving attacks such as blows struck in close combat, mines and the like.

The compact high-discharge powers cells are enough for 1 hour of continuous use and are classed as Rare items with a base cost of 1,000 Thrones each. The power cells are not re-chargeable.

# <span id="page-182-0"></span>Infantry Gear In fan try Gear

*"The most important item of gear cannot be carried in your kit, and that is your faith in the Emperor. Without that, nothing can help you."*

— Imperial Guard saying.

#### **The 9-70 Entrenching Tool**

Used mostly to fill sandbags, this small folding shovel is durable and handy for a variety of other duties such as ditch and grave digging. It also serves as a nasty improvised weapon.

#### **Backpack or Field Sack**

Heavy and durable, each can hold almost everything listed here. For many a Guardsman a field sack also serves as his body bag when his service to the Emperor comes to an end.

#### **Bedroll**

Bedrolls are one of the infantrymen's favoured possessions, for it offers a modicum of comfort at night or whenever there is a change to catch a few winks. Bedrolls include heavy blankets.

#### **Compass/Orienting Device**

Normally a simple magnetic compass, calibrated to current planetary true and magnetic polar locations, these tools are vital additions to any infantryman's kit.

#### **Dog Tags**

Dog tags are issued to all Imperial soldiers and often serve as the only means of identifying their remains. The more heretical renegades collect them as souvenirs.

#### **Hostile Weather Gear**

Depending on the battlefield, additional items such as tent liners, heating bricks, sunscreen, extra blankets, insect repellent, heavy gloves, greatcoats or parkas, filtration plugs, rad pills and more can be issued.

#### **The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer**

One of the most widespread books in the galaxy, every Imperial Guardsman must (by regulation) have a copy of it on their person at all times. It is filled with useful information including xenos recognition, weapon maintenance and use, survival and medical tips, and combat formations. More importantly, it carries prayers, hymns, litanies and inspirational passages to ensure that proper spiritual and morale levels are kept at proper levels.

#### **Infantry Lamp Pack**

Rugged and compact, these light sources can be hand-held or fitted to the bayonet lugs on most rifles. A focusing dial on the lens can adjust the beam to either a wide swath for general lighting or a tight longer range illumination. A lamp pack runs for 1d5+5 hours on a standard charge.

#### **Mess Kit**

A mess kit contains a combination spoon and fork, knife and collapsible mug, all fitting into a clamshell container that doubles as tray. Often a meal is simply placed in the container, closed tightly, and dropped into an open fire for rapid cooking.

#### **Personal Grooming Kit**

These kits include shaving gear, soap, dental care items and other things as deemed appropriate by the regimental commander, such as anti-fungal and parasite powders.

# VI: War Zones

#### <span id="page-183-0"></span>**Sandbags**

Doubly useful in the field as they can be filled with earth or sand to provide protection, or filled with clothing to create a makeshift pillow.

#### **Tent**

Simple and durable, this tent can fit two people and their gear. Standard issue tents are waterproof with a reflective side for sun-baked climates.

#### **Tool Kit**

A small set of screwdrivers, wrenches, wire and other items for maintenance and routine repairs, tool kits often contain rolls of "mud tape" (named as it sticks to everything and never comes off ) and a small multi-purpose axe as well.

#### **Uniform**

While many things are standardised in the Imperial Guard, uniforms are definitely not one of them. Each regiment has their own styles of dress, depending on their home world, background and combat style. In the Calixis Sector, uniforms can range from the impeccable dress of the Scintillan platoons to the ragged colours of the Penal Legions. Each also has differing standards such that individuals in each platoon may even maintain different battledress uniforms. Most, though, consist of heavy durable clothing and tough boots with thick socks to withstand a lifetime's worth of marching. Rain gear, gloves and other items can be included depending on Munitorum decree.

#### **Weapon/Gear Storage**

A variety of durable lightweight items used to store items such as ammunition packs, sidearm weapons and grenades. Common forms are hip packs, holsters, bandoliers and vests. Worn over armour, they allow easy storage while keeping the arms free for fighting. Most items a soldier needs quickly are carried in them, especially ammunition clips, grenades and a sidearm. Like uniforms these can vary from regiment to regiment. The harness can hold a maximum of 15 kg worth of small items.

#### **Weapon Maintenance Kit**

Most commonly designed around the ubiquitous lasgun, each kit includes items such as blessed oils and lubricants, swabbing cloths, cleaning gels, weapon-specific tools and spare parts such as a spare stock and barrel. As standard, these kits are calibrated to Calixis-patterns, but generally work on all Munitorum-issued lasguns. Bear in mind, without the proper litanies and invocations, however, even the finest efforts will not ensure that the weapon maintains its proper function.

#### **Whistle**

A surprisingly effective tool for alerting other members of your platoon of dangers or calling for help, whistles are standard issue. Some of the Scintillan regiments have adopted

hiver ocarinas to also relay battle instructions in coded tones when electronic communications may be compromised.

#### **Battlefield Rations Civilian Relief Rations** Battlefield Rations

Ration bricks made from recycled food waste or any other organic materials, used for civilian relief in areas of intense fighting. Also known as "Emperor's Mercy" bars, each can just barely keep a person alive for a day. The less said about their taste the better.

#### **Combat Ration Pack**

Each metallic pouch contains foodstuffs for one complete meal (including vitamin supplements) along with salt and water puri-tabs, a protein bar and minor medical supplies. No cooking is required but most troops either use open flames, squad hexamine stoves or their tank armour to heat them where possible. These packs are more or less sufficient to keep a soldier fighting, albeit flavourless (or worse bad tasting) and unappealing for extended use.

#### **Daily Prayers**

Another civilian relief item, these parchments can be airdropped into cities or even rolled up and fired from grenades or mortars. Each contains inspirational addresses to maintain spiritual wellbeing and morale. Each is also heavily imprinted with nutrients chewed they can sustain physical well-being as well.

| Table 6–7: War Zone Battlefield Rations |      |       |              |  |  |  |  |  |
|-----------------------------------------|------|-------|--------------|--|--|--|--|--|

| Long Duration Ration Pack               | 5    | 1kg   | Common       |  |  |  |  |  |

#### **Emergency Rations**

Just a step above relief rations, these are generally stowed in tanks or aircraft to supplement individual packs. When a unit must wait for relief or rescue, they can stretch daily packs into weeks of sustenance.

#### **Long Duration Ration Pack**

Much the same as a regular pack, but includes higher-energy items for troopers conducting forced marches or intense activities away from central command.

#### <span id="page-184-0"></span>**Drugs and Medical Gear** Drugs and Medical Gear

*"Faith heals all wounds."*

— Ancient saying of the Orders Hospitaller.

All Guardsmen carry a standard basic medikit, which can vary in contents and effectiveness from regiment to regiment. Advanced medikits are standard issue gear for Medicae in the field. Other medical help is available for most Guardsmen and other combatants, ranging from the simple to the sophisticated.

#### **Cast Spray**

A variation of synth-skin, cast spray forms a tough rigid coating over broken limbs so the trooper can be more easily transported. The temporary cast has coagulants and counterseptic drugs laced into the material to help fight Blood Loss and infection (reduces Difficulty of Medicae Test to stop Blood Loss by one-step).

#### **Counterseptics**

These include a broad range of antiseptics and analgesics to fight off infections, either injected via a pre-packaged needle or ingested in tab form. When taken, a counterseptic drug gives a +20 bonus on any Tests made to resist disease or infections for six hours.

#### **Ghostfire Pollen Extract**

An incredibly dangerous liquid distilled from the condensed pollen of the Ghostfire flowers of Iocanthos, Ghostfire extract is the material from which the bulk of the Segmentum Obscurus's versions of Frenzon are actually derived. The potency of the extract is such that the Imperium long ago concluded it was a far better idea to create a "lesser version" than lose soldiers to the overwhelming effects of a pure dose.

A dose of Ghostfire pollen extract grants the Fearless and Frenzy talents and the Unnatural Agility (×2) trait. The effects last for 2d10 minutes. As a side effect, however, the user takes 1 point of Damage (ignoring Armour and Toughness Bonus) as he bleeds through his pores.

#### **Halo**

Commonly given to Penal Legionnaries, Halo creates a compliant state suitable for combat prisoner indoctrination. Users can be better readied and even made enthusiastic to meet their coming fate on the battlefield. Other heavily stressed troopers use it to forcibly induce a calmer frame of mind. A dose of Halo adds +10 on all tests to resist Fear and Pinning, but reduces Perception by -10, effects lasts for 1d10 hours.

#### **Kick**

A potent combination of neural accelerants and stimulants, Kick makes the user feel supercharged with energy. It is ideal for short-term assaults as the effects burn off rapidly inducing profound fatigue and listlessness for the next several hours. A single dose of Kick removes all Fatigue levels and provides immunity to Fatigue for 2d10 Rounds. Once it wears off, the user takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.

#### **Rainbow**

A somewhat dangerous all-in-one injection covering almost anything that can be wrong with someone. It includes an anti-bacterial serum, a blood clotting agent, an allergen, poison and radiation antidote broad-band immune booster, vitamins, a white cell stimulator and a sedative. This much stimulation to the body's system can also cause massive shock, but when faced with a life or death situation against an unknown ailment some medicae take the gamble. An application of this drug allows the patient to immediately re-roll any failed Tests to resist disease or toxins and automatically stops Blood Loss. However, users must also immediately succeed on a Toughness Test or take 1d5 points of Damage ignoring Armour and Toughness Bonus.

#### **Synth-Skin**

A thin foam sprayed over burned flesh wounds to staunch bleeding and promote new skin regeneration, synth-skin is commonly issued to troopers for their own battlefield dressings. An application of synth-skin, a Full Action, stops Blood Loss.

#### **Toxin Wands**

Easy to use by untrained personnel, toxin wands work to detect poisons and recommend counter-agents and immunisers. A character can use a toxin wand to determine whether or not someone has been poisoned or not by succeeding at a Challenging (+0) Perception Test or a Routine (+20) Medicae Test. Success by two or more degrees also grants enough information to identify an antidote (if one exists).
