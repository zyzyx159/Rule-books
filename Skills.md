*"It is likely that I have forgotten more about the Imperium than you will ever know, acolyte."*
— Kyos Veeble, Autosavant.

Part of the fun of Dark Heresy is deciding which Skills to develop and learn during the career of your character. This chapter contains all the detailed information you might need to help you use Skills to their full effect. See **Playing the Game - Skill Tests** for details on Skill Tests, Characteristics and how they are made.
# **GAINING SKILLS**
Scrutiny
*"Foolish are those who fear nothing, yet claim to know everything."*

— *Lexiconum Moralis.*

When you create your character you begin with a list of starting Skills based on your home world, as well as a selection of Skills from your Career Path. These Skills represent what you have learned in your life up to the point where you chose to serve the Inquisition. Over time, you will gain additional Experience, which you can spend to acquire new Skills or improve existing ones.
### SKILL MASTERY

Sometimes you will have the opportunity to acquire Skill Mastery with a skill you already have, which represents additional training and experience to build upon normal skills. Skill Mastery is represented on the Career Rank Advance Schemes as the base skill with a +10 or +20 bonus. The base skill must be acquired first, then the +10 version, then the +20. As it is possible to buy advances from previous ranks, if you miss a base skill which is offered at Skill Mastery level on a later rank, you can still acquire the base skill from the lower rank’s advances in order to then take the Skill Mastery. Should you gain the same Skill twice - for example, from a Background Package and you later pay xp to acquire it from your Career Advances, you instead gain the Talented Talent for that Skill.
#### **Example**
*Mordechai acquires the Interrogation Skill at the Regulator Rank. When he reaches the Arbitrator Rank he can acquire Interrogation +10, granting him a +10 bonus to any Tests made with that Skill. If Mordechai then advanced to the Intelligencer Rank, he would have Interrogation +20 available, which would increase his bonus when using the Skill to +20. If Mordechai did not acquire Interrogation as a Regulator, but decided he wanted it when he reached Arbitrator Rank, he could still purchase Interrogation from the Regulator Advances and the +10 version from Arbitrator.*

*Should he later enter the Malfian Bloodsworn Alternate Career Rank, taking the Interrogation skill from this separate Advance grants him the Talented (Interrogation) Talent. He cannot take this Talent more than once, so acquiring Interrogation +10 for a second time would be a waste of his xp.*
# **BASIC & ADVANCED SKILLS**

*"Even the lowest trade is blessed, if it is done in the Emperor's name."*

— Administratum Motto.

Skills are divided into two categories: Basic and Advanced. This distinction defines which Skills you can use without special training and which Skills you can't.
## **BASIC SKILLS**

Basic Skills are those common to citizens throughout the Imperium, and simply growing up on a world under Imperial rule exposes characters to the rudiments of the Skill. As a result, you can make Skill Tests using Basic Skills even if you don't have the Skill in question. Since you are relying on natural aptitude rather than any sort of formal training, you make the test at half (round down) your Characteristic.

The Characteristic gets halved before any situational modifiers get applied to the test. An Easy test against an untrained Basic Skill would be (Characteristic/2)+30, and not (Characteristic+30)/2.
## **ADVANCED SKILLS**

Advanced Skills are those that require training and experience in order to master and understand. If you do not have an Advanced Skill, you cannot attempt it. No matter how intelligent you are, for instance, you will not be able to access an encrypted cogitator engine without some formal training in cryptography or usage of advanced technical systems.
## **SKILL DESCRIPTORS**

Some Skills are flagged with special descriptors such as combat, crafting, interaction, investigation, movement or operator. These Skills use special rules that are described in **Playing the Game** and **The Game Master.** In summary, Crafting skills are those used to create items from scratch and spare parts. Interaction skills are those used when interacting with NPCs. Investigation skills are those used to ferret out additional information about a subject. Movement skills offer alternative means to get around your environment. And finally, Operator skills allow you to operate a vehicle.
### **Crafting Skills**

Certain Skills enable you to create items from parts and materials. To do so, you must have the materials, as determined by the GM, available. You then test the appropriate Skill (e.g. Chem-Use or Trade (any)) applying any bonuses or penalties due to the quality of materials, environmental factors and anything else as determined by the GM. On a success, you generate the item. Note that the quality/finish/usefulness of the item improves for each degree of success gained. Failing by three degrees indicates you have ruined some of the materials. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that you have completely ruined all of the Skill Group's materials and must start over from scratch. Note that the time it takes to create the item is determined by the GM.

Details on the steps for creating items can be found in **Playing the Game - Crafting**.
### **Interaction Skills**

The difficulty of the Skill Test depends on the target's disposition, which is determined by the GM. See **The Game Master** for guidelines. Note that this is a guide, and your GM may modify the difficulties based on the circumstances of the encounter.
## **SKILL GROUPS**

Some of the listed Skills are actually groups of related abilities. Skill groups are listed under one entry for the sake of ease, but each one is a separate ability that must be acquired individually. For example: Scholastic Lore (Imperial Law) and Scholastic Lore (Imperial History) are different Skills. A character with Scholastic Lore (Imperial History) cannot make Scholastic Lore (Imperial Law) Tests and vice versa.

## **Acrobatics 
(Advanced, Movement) 
Agility**

The Acrobatics skill encompasses a variety of movement techniques unavailable to less flexible Acolytes. From performing somersaults to tumbling, from flipping through the air to daring leaps and jumps, this Skill expands your movement options. Useful for the Acolyte on the move, Acrobatics can be used in numerous situations to negate obstacles and circumvent treacherous conditions. Acrobatics can also provide a definitive edge when facing less agile foes.

Use this Skill to perform some spectacular feat of derring-do. The Difficulty depends on the desired action. The more complicated the manoeuvre, such as somersaulting over a group of enraged cultists to grab the skids of a Vulture as it takes off, the harder the difficulty. The more degrees of success you attain, the more impressive the result.

An Acrobatics Test is typically a Full Action, however please note the following special rules are associated with this Skill that may modify this:

**Disengage:** You may make an Acrobatics Test when attempting a Disengage Action to reduce it to a Half Action.

**Hot Pursuit:** Normally, chasing after an opponent or fleeing from a pursuer is an Opposed Agility Test. To the acrobatic Acolyte, however, the environment can be a valuable tool, an advantage that allows the Acolyte to leap over railings, run along aerial walkways, jump across rooftops and careen down staircases. Whenever you are engaged in a pursuit through a congested area—crowds, difficult terrain, and so on, you may make an Acrobatics Test (in place of your Agility Test) for the Opposed Test.

**Jumping & Leaping:** You may substitute an Acrobatics Test for an Agility Test when Jumping or Strength Tests when Leaping.

**Negotiating Obstacles:** To a skilled acrobat, every obstacle is an opportunity, and every obstruction a challenge instead of a barrier. Whenever you Charge or Run through treacherous terrain or through an area containing an obstacle, you may make an Acrobatics Test in place of an Agility Test to avoid falling Prone. You may also attempt an Acrobatics Test as a Free Action prior to moving at your normal rate through treacherous environments (but not environments made treacherous because of poor visibility).

**Tumbling Evasion:** When engaged with an opponent, you may Test Acrobatics to disengage as a Half Action instead of a Full Action. A successful Test allows you to move as if you had taken a Half Move Action without granting your opponent a free attack (see **Fleeing** in **Playing the Game - Combat** for more information). A failed Test means you still move, but your opponent gets a free attack with a +10 bonus.
## **Awareness 
(Basic) 
Perception

The Awareness skill reflects your ability to perceive hidden dangers and to notice small details about your physical surroundings. You use the Awareness skill to notice ambushes, spot traps and discern other threats to you and your allies. Awareness is not tied to any one sense; it encompasses them all. 

Easily one of the most important Skills to an investigator, as without this Skill, he is doomed to forever stumble into ambushes and traps, and to overlook vital clues.

When using Awareness to detect a hidden enemy, the Test is always Opposed. Otherwise, the thing you are trying to detect applies a Difficulty based on how cunningly concealed it is.

An Awareness Test is usually a Free Action made in reaction to something. The following special rule is associated with this skill:

**Eye for Detail:** Particularly perceptive Acolytes are trained to take in every aspect of a scene with just a quick scan, later recalling the subtlest of details that turn out to be critical to the investigation. Awareness cannot be used as an Investigation Skill in its own right, but it can be used to assist an Investigation Skill. When examining a crime scene, you may make an Awareness Test to attempt to notice any clues. Every degree of success reduces the Difficulty of a subsequent investigation Test by one-step.
##### Example:
*Mattheus takes a quick look around the scene of a grisly ritual murder, but does not have time to carry out a lengthy investigation as his companions need him elsewhere. He makes an Awareness Test to notice any clues, getting two degrees of success. Later he comes to make an Inquiry Test, and recalls clues he spotted earlier, reducing the Difficulty of the Test by two-steps to Ordinary.*
## **Barter 
(Basic) 
Fellowship

Whether conducting menial chores in the marketplace before setting off on a mission, bribing guards to let you slip in the backdoor unnoticed, or negotiating for a choice piece of information, the Barter skill is always handy for minimising the impact to an Inquisitor’s cred-stick.

You can use the Barter skill to negotiate deals and get better prices on goods and services. When dealing with day-to-day affairs, like haggling in a bazaar over the price of a fine set of tarot cards, or trading lho-sticks for food in an arbitrator cell block, a single Test is sufficient. However, for important deals, such as those entailing risk to one side, carried out under dangerous circumstances or involving a large amount of Thrones (negotiating the bounty on the head of a dangerous alien, for instance), the GM may call for an Opposed Test, with both sides using their Barter skill. As a rough guide, a success will reduce the price of an item by 10%, with each additional success reducing it by a further 5%.

A typical Barter Test takes about five minutes, but delicate dealings and intricate negotiations may require more time, as decided by the GM. The following special rule is associated with this skill:

**Bribery:** By first making a Barter Test, you can increase your chances of success with a subsequent Interaction Test by offering goods, services or cold, hard Thrones. A successful Barter Test and each degree of success beyond, grants you a +5 bonus on your next Interaction Test against your target made within a number of days equal to your Fellowship Bonus. The Difficulty of the Barter Test depends on the nature of the bribe as determined by the GM, who take in account the value of the bribe and the target’s honesty and motivations.
## **Blather 
(Advanced, Interaction) 
Fellowship

Whilst unable to spin elaborate webs of lies as with Charm or Deceit, Blather is useful for baffling a guard long enough to escape, creating a distraction or stalling for time... or for coming up with a good excuse to feed your Inquisitor.

When you make a Blather Test, you run off at the mouth, spewing a stream of words and nonsense in an attempt to confuse and distract others. A Blather Test is always Opposed by your target's Willpower (or Scrutiny). If you succeed and the target fails, the target is distracted by you and can do nothing for one Round, staring dumbfounded and wondering if you are drunk, crazy or both. For every degree of success, you dumbfound the target for an additional Round.

If your target succeeds and you fail, or if you both fail, your attempt at verbal acrobatics fails and the target may act normally. In the case where you both succeed, the character that had the most degrees of success determines the outcome.

You can also use Blather against multiple opponents. For similar opponents—those that have the same general Characteristics—make a Blather Test as normal, but the GM rolls just one Willpower Test. If you win the Opposed Test, you affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

NPCs, while confused by your banter, are unaffected by your words if they are in obvious danger or if it is clear there are preparations being made to harm them. The target must understand the language you are speaking or the Test automatically fails—you cannot, for instance, use this Skill against animals.

A Blather Test is usually a Full Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Create Disturbance:** You may spew inane and nonsensical banter to create a distraction to divert attention from some other ally or event. If you have allies nearby who might benefit from the distraction—sneaking past a guard or picking their pocket, you may make a Blather Test to help them out. You make a Blather Test as normal and, if successful, use your Blather skill to assist your ally. Your opponent is dumbfounded as normal, although if your ally fails their own Test then the opponent may realise what is going on.

**Distract Opponent:** You can attempt to distract your opponent and conceal your hostile intentions. So long as you are not in combat and have not exhibited any hostile or overly confrontational actions towards your opponent, you may make a Blather Test opposed by your opponent’s Willpower or Scrutiny. If you are successful you distract your opponent as though you had successfully feinted in combat, and so long as your next Action is a standard attack, it cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a standard attack then this advantage is lost. You may only use this function of Blather once per encounter.
## **Carouse 
(Basic) 
Toughness**

Whether consuming the finest amasec brandy or the cheapest stomach-stripping hive juices, you use the Carouse skill to resist the effects of alcohol and narcotics. Experienced carousers can build up quite a tolerance and remain clear-headed and lucid while those around them succumb to the effects of their amusements. Use this Skill whenever you must resist the effects of alcohol or similar intoxicants.

Whilst excessive drinking is hardly encouraged by the Inquisition, only the most puritanical of Inquisitors would begrudge their Acolytes a drink or two. In addition to its primary use for relaxing, many an important clue or tip-off has been gained whilst carousing in a none too salubrious establishment, and only Acolytes who can hold their amasec stand any chance of remembering it come the morning.

Each time you take a drink or some other form of intoxicant, make a Carouse Test. Failure indicates you have gained a level of Fatigue or suffered the side effects of the substance. Should you pass out as a result, you become unconscious for a number of hours equal to 1d10 minus your Toughness Bonus (minimum one hour). Your GM may incur further Test penalties as a result of intoxicant use as they see fit.

A Carouse Test is a Free Action. You use this Skill whenever you imbibe. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Drinking Contests:** A drinking contest, whether in the form of a competition to drink alcohol the fastest or to be the last man standing, is simply an Opposed Carouse Test. The consequences for failure are usually embarrassing rather than harmful, although this does depend on the drink consumed.

**Iron Stomach:** Acolytes who spend a great deal of time ingesting drugs and alcohol find that they develop a tolerance for a whole host of toxins. Whenever you knowingly consume something that is poisonous or toxic, you may make a Carouse Test in place of the Toughness Test. This use does not apply to poisons or toxins that have been injected, applied to weapons or delivered by any other non-oral methods.
## **Charm 
(Basic, Interaction) 
Fellowship**

One of the more vital tools available to Acolytes in their pursuit of the witch and heretic, Charm allows you to instil feeling of kinship and companionability in those you meet. A successful Test can make friends out of foes, bank the fires of anger, and get you into places where the bullet would otherwise fail.

The Charm skill is used to befriend others. You make Charm Tests whenever you want to change the minds of individuals or small groups, to beg, or seduce. You need not make a Charm Test every time you talk to an NPC; only when you want to change their opinions of you or convince them to do something for you, such as giving you a tip, a dance or a kiss.

A Charm Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus and your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say.

A Charm Test typically takes one minute. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Bamboozle:** You can convince a target to do something they otherwise might not do by laying it on thick with flattery, encouragement, and dishonest praise. You can bamboozle the target, effectively improving his Disposition by two-steps instead of the normal one-step, by accepting a -20 penalty to your Charm Test. If successful the target does as you ask, but afterwards he is entitled to an Intelligence Test to realise he has been used. If he succeeds, his Disposition worsens by three steps.
On a failed Charm Test to bamboozle, the target’s Disposition drops by one-step.

**First Impression:** First impressions last, as the old Imperial adage goes, and it will do you well to keep this in mind as you make your way through the universe. When you first encounter a character, you may make a Charm Test to leave them with a positive impression, making subsequent Interaction Skill Tests one-step easier until you fail a Skill Test or commit some breach of etiquette or social blunder. Of course, if you fail this Test your attempt has the opposite effect, making Interaction Skill Tests one-step more difficult.
## **Chem-Use 
(Advanced, Crafting, Investigation) 
Intelligence**

The life of an Acolyte is one fraught with peril, with hidden dangers everywhere as enemies of the Imperium do their best to survive under the oppressive weight of the Inquisition. Since many foes lack the firepower to mount significant opposition against the agents of the Inquisition, many resort to cowardly tactics in the forms of poisons, toxins and other vile substances to confuse, injure or kill their enemies. Chem-Use, then, can serve as the first line of defence against these vile weapons, while also giving the Acolyte the tools to concoct filthy brews of his own.

You can use the Chem-Use skill to handle and prepare chemicals safely, especially toxins, poisons and drugs. Chem-Use covers the use and manufacture of toxins and it can also be used to identify a variety of chemicals (Investigation use). 

When manufacturing substances from base components, especially on a large scale, the Trade (Chymist) skill is used instead of Chem-Use.

To prepare or apply a chemical, you must succeed at a Chem-Use Test, with modifiers determined by the GM. On a failed test the chemical is wasted. If you fail by five or more degrees, you accidentally poison yourself or overdose.

When using a toxin wand or administering an antidote, the time taken to do so is halved with a successful Chem-Use Test.

A Chem-Use Test to administer a chemical is usually a Full Action. Note that employing Chem-Use to apply particularly complex combinations of substances or toxins uses an Extended Test of duration and difficulty set by the GM for the treatment in question. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Alien Toxins:** From the unholy cocktails imbued with the warp by Chaos cultists to the strange and lethal venom of the Tyranids, the galaxy brims with an appalling assortment of venoms and poisons, all of which are available if you know the right place to look. Normally, when you encounter a toxin, you may Test Chem-Use to identify it (see **Detecting Poisons** below). If you fail this Test, you may still use the toxin, but the Difficulty worsens by two-steps.

**Concealing Poisons:** Whenever you want to introduce a toxin into a target’s food, drink or air and want to conceal your activity, you may make a **Difficult (–10) Chem-Use Test** to administer the chemical in a way the victim may not detect. On a success, you apply the poison normally. However, for each degree of success, you worsen the Difficulty of the Chem-Use Test made later to identify the toxin from the victim’s remains.

**Detecting Poisons:** You may use Chem-Use when analysing the remains of a victim to detect toxins and chemicals buried in the flesh. Provided you have a tox-wand or a chymistry lab, a successful Chem-Use Test reveals the absence or presence of such a substance. Each degree of success reveals one more component of the substance, including such things as what it is, its method of delivery, and the most likely places where it can be procured.
If you lack proper equipment, you take a –20 penalty on your Chem-Use Test. Other factors can modify the Difficulty, including the quality of the remains, attempts to mask the substance chemically, or even the nature of the substance itself.
## **Ciphers 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, War Cant, Secret Society, Occult and Underworld.

The Ciphers skill reflects an understanding of shorthand codes employed by certain groups to confer basic ideas, warnings, and information about a given area. This can be in the form of hand signals or as physical symbols inscribed on a surface, usually in a subtle place. Ciphers are not very sophisticated, mostly used to warn of danger, mark a target or indicate protection. Skill Tests are not required to read basic messages but may be necessary to decipher complicated communications or worn or damaged signs.

Many Inquisitors develop their own Ciphers to communicate their instructions to their Acolytes, while also giving a vital tool for use between their servants while on missions. Whilst the Skill Groups for this Skill are quite broad, you can make them more specific, effectively creating sub-groups for each sub-skill. When using the Ciphers skill to discern or translate the meaning of the code of which you do not actually know, but is within a Skill Group for which you are trained, you may Test Ciphers normally, but at a –20 penalty.

The Skill Groups most likely to be encountered by Acolytes are as follows:

**Acolyte:** Used to communicate a private and prearranged code between given members of an Acolyte's cell. Note that this code is unique to each cell of Acolytes.

**War Cant**: Used to convey instructions to troops by means of hand signals, body language or musical code.

**Secret Society:** Used by members of a given secret society or cult to identify one another and convey simple messages. Note that this code is unique to each secret society.

**Occult:** Mystical gestures used to focus the mind during incantation, to identify fellow sorcerers and to supplicate or castigate Daemons.

**Underworld:** Convoluted systems of hand gestures, clothing styles, signs and other such chicanery used by criminal fraternities to communicate key information.

A Ciphers Test usually takes a Full Action to give or inscribe the sign, and a Free Action to comprehend it. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Countermeasures:** When a cipher is cracked by the enemy, it usually means bad news for those groups who rely on it, leading to misinformation and signs laid by the enemy that lead them into traps. If you suspect that your cipher has been cracked or that someone is using it to feed you bad information, you may make a Cipher Test opposed by your opponent’s Cipher Test. Success indicates that you have worked out that something is wrong, giving you the opportunity to turn the tables on your opponent. Failure indicates that you are none the wiser to the subterfuge. The GM always rolls both sides of the Opposed Test in secret to avoid tipping you off that something is up.

**Deciphering a Cipher:** Once you have identified a cipher, the meaning remains hidden unless it can first be deciphered. The easiest way to decipher a cipher is to capture someone who already knows its meaning and then persuade them to reveal its secrets. Otherwise, the task becomes a lot harder, requiring days of painstaking code cracking and number crunching, and even then you may only be able to decipher this particular message and not crack the entire cipher. Cracking a cipher is an Investigation Test with a Hard benchmark, meaning that Tests to overcome it are at a 
–20 penalty. The process takes one month. You may use raw Intelligence, or your Logic or Scholastic Lore (Cryptology) as the Investigation Skill. Successfully interrogating or bribing someone who knows the code may reduce the benchmark of the investigation or negate the need for a roll at all.
## **Climb 
(Basic, Movement) 
Strength**

Whether breaking into a cultist stronghold, clambering up scaffolding to find a good place for sniping at your enemies, or scrambling up a tree to escape from the snapping jaws of some alien beast, Climb is a useful Skill to have.

Generally, a successful Test allows you to ascend or descend at half of your Half Move rate.

Any character with both hands free can climb any surface with hand-holds, or a suitable angle to brace against, with a Strength Test—if you have the Climb Skill, you may Test this at a +10 bonus. On a success, you ascend or descend at a rate of one-half your Half Move speed (to a minimum of a 1/2 metre). For each degree of success, you climb an extra metre. On a failed Test, you fall from your starting climbing position. Climbing Difficulty varies with the nature of the climbing surface: a stony cliff with decent handholds would likely be **Challenging (+0)** or **Ordinary (+10)**, while a knotted rope would be one-step easier.

Certain surfaces pose special challenges, such as masonry walls without adequate hand-holds or an ascent that requires traversing a vertical overhang. In such a situation Climb becomes an Advanced Skill, meaning those without this Skill cannot attempt to navigate the obstacle in question without the aid of gear or equipment—it is simply impassable to anyone who isn't a trained climber.

A Climb Test is usually a Half Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Abseiling:** You can descend ropes and ladders more quickly by abseiling. You descend at a rate of 10 metres per Round with a successful Climb Test. If the Test is failed, the rate is reduced to 5 metres per Round. However, if the Test is failed by two or more degrees, you must succeed on another Climb Test or lose your grip. Unless you have a climbing harness, you fall.

**Helping Others Climb:** You may help novice climbers climb by setting up guide ropes for them, pointing out good hand holds or physically helping them up. You may assist another person with a Climb Test, even if they don’t have the Skill themselves.

**Rappel:** You can descend more quickly when rappelling ropes are in place. When using ropes to rappel, you may Test Climb to safely descend at a speed of three times your normal Move Rate. A failed Test means you make no progress. A failed Test by one or more degrees means that you have become tangled up in the rope and must succeed on a Climb Test on the following Round to free yourself. A failed Test by three or more degrees means that a dreadful mishap has occurred and you fall, taking Damage as normal.

**Speed Climbing:** You may climb more quickly by taking an additional penalty on your Climb Test. By worsening the Test’s Difficulty by –20, you can ascend or descend at your normal Move Rate instead of half your Move rate.
## **Command 
(Basic) 
Fellowship**

If you have ambitions toward leadership you would do well to invest in Command, so that when the day comes that you attain the Rank of Inquisitor yourself, you will be better able to lead your own Acolytes. Even before this distant and unlikely day of glory, Command has its uses, allowing you the ability to exert your influence over citizens, soldiers and more.

Command is used to make subordinates follow your orders. You may only use this Skill on those who are under your authority. A successful Command Test indicates that those whom you direct follow your instructions. On a failed Test, they either misinterpret the command or do nothing at all, or if you fail by five or more degrees, contradict your orders entirely.

A Command Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus and your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say.

A Command Test is a Half Action for simple commands and a Full Action for more involved instructions. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Compel:** This expanded function works just like the Charm special rule **bamboozle**, except it applies to Command Tests. See Charm above for details.

**Devoted Followers:** Whenever you succeed on a Command Test to issue an order to an NPC who is Devoted or Fanatical (see Dispositions on page 230 in Dark Heresy) you grant a +5 bonus on a single Test related to that order for every degree of success attained. Multiple successful Tests are not cumulative and the benefits of a successful Test remain for a number of hours equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

**Instil Loyalty:** The greater the respect that your minions have for you, the greater your influence over them. You can improve the Disposition of your followers by making a Command Test while giving them a rousing speech, handing out medals or offering them encouragement. This Test takes a few minutes and a successful Test improves the target’s Disposition by one-step. The improved Disposition remains until circumstances or your behaviour gives them cause to change.
## **Common Lore 
(Advanced, Investigation) 
Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Adeptus Arbites, Machine Cult, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Imperial Creed, Imperial Guard, Imperium, Tech, Underworld, War. Other Common Lores may be available at the GM's discretion.

Use the Common Lore skill to recall the habits, institutions, traditions, public figures and superstitions of a particular world, cultural group, organisation or race. This Skill does not represent scholarly learning (that is Scholastic Lore), nor obscure and/or carefully guarded knowledge (that is Forbidden Lore), but rather the basics you learn by growing up or travelling extensively through a region. Such lore represents the little snippets of local knowledge and information picked up when growing up in a place or inside an organisation. Whilst overshadowed in study by more scholarly Skills, Common Lore should never be underestimated, as knowing just the right thing to say, place to hide or contact to meet can be the difference between success and
failure, life and death.

When making a Common Lore Test, you recall basic information about the subject. Each degree of success reveals a bit more information as determined by the GM. Some Common Lore Skill Groups are described as follows:

**Adeptus Arbites:** Knowledge of the various arms and sub-sects of the Arbites, including such things as their ranking structure and common procedures.

**Administratum:** Broad knowledge of the inner workings, rules and regulations of the Administratum.

**Ecclesiarchy:** Understanding of the hierarchy of the Cult of the Emperor, its rankings, greetings and general practices.

**Imperial Creed:** Knowledge of the rites and practices of the Imperial Cult, the most common observances to the Emperor and the most well-known saints.

**Imperial Guard:** Basic information about the ranking systems, logistics and structure of the Imperial Guard as well as such things as their common practices, both tactical and strategic.

**Imperium:** Knowledge of the sectors, segmentums and most well-known worlds of the Imperium.

**Machine Cult:** A general understanding of the symbols and practices of the Mechanicus, as well as such things as formal greetings and identifying rankings.

**Tech:** An understanding of simple litanies and rituals to sooth and appease machine spirits.

**Underworld:** Understanding of organised crime and sedition within the Imperium.

**War:** Knowledge of great battles, notable (and notorious) commanders and heroes, as well as famous stratagems.

Using Common Lore takes no time at all. You either know something or you do not. The following special rules are associated with this skill: 

**Famous Stratagems:** Whenever you would be called upon to make a Scholastic Lore (Tactica Imperialis) Test, you may instead make a Common Lore (Imperial Guard or War) Test, but at a –20 penalty, so long as the Test relates to famous battles or strategies.

**Local Knowledge:** For all a navigator’s charts and maps, sometimes nothing beats local knowledge. You may make a Common Lore (Imperium, or other related lore) to see if you know anything useful about the local area. If successful you gain a +10 bonus to the next Navigation or Survival Test made in the same locale.

**Practices and Procedures:** A little knowledge about an organisation’s practises and procedures goes a long way to smoothing things over when dealing with them. You may make a relevant Common Lore Test prior to dealing with members of an organisation. If successful, you gain a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests made when dealing with them.

**Red Tape:** Knowledge of the inside workings of the Administratum can give you the means to cut through endless layers of bureaucracy. When requesting information or assistance from the Administratum as part of an investigation, you may make a Common Lore (Administratum) or Scholastic Lore (Bureaucracy) Test. If successful, you may reduce the time taken by a further two hours for every degree of success. Alternatively, you can attempt to delay an attempt to get information by an enemy, increasing the time taken by two hours for every degree of success.
On a failed Test, you increase the time taken by two hours plus two hours for every degree of failure, or if delaying an enemy, decrease the time taken by two hours plus two hours for every degree of failure.
###### Example:
*In the effort to track down a bit of elusive information, you research in the depths of an Administratum building, requesting data-slates on various suspects. As normal, you Test Scholastic Lore. Since the investigation counts as Drudging, it normally takes 24 hours. However, you succeeded on the Test, roll a 2 on your 1d10 and add your Intelligence Bonus of 5 for a total of 7. The investigation now takes 17 hours. But, you are in a bit of a hurry so try to cut through the red tape. You make a Common Lore (Administratum) Test and get two degrees of success. The investigation is further reduced by four hours, to 13 hours. Still a long night, but not as long now that the bureaucrats are on your side.*
## **Concealment 
(Basic) 
Agility**

Sometimes there’s no better option than to just hide from your enemies, whether it be from a rampaging Chaos Titan, a unit of corrupt Arbitrators, or the guards of a townhouse that you have just violated. A successful Concealment Test may allow you to slip away, unseen and unnoticed, to continue your service to the God-Emperor.

Concealment is used whenever you want to hide from sight. To use this Skill, there must be appropriate terrain (trees, walls, buildings or some other obstacle) or some concealing effect like fog or darkness. Otherwise, the test automatically fails. Concealment is always an Opposed Test, in which you pit your Concealment Test against your opponent's Awareness Test (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill). You need not Test Concealment when you hide, only when someone is looking for you. If you succeed, you remain unseen.

If you remain perfectly still, you gain a +10 bonus to your Test.

A Concealment Test is usually a Half Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Camouflage:** Whenever you would attempt to conceal another character, you can Test Concealment and apply the results of your Test for that character. The effects of a successful Test remain only so long as that character has the benefit of cover, reduced visibility (fog, foliage, etc.), and does not move. If the concealed character moves, he is no longer concealed.

**Sniping:** Whenever you attack an enemy while successfully hidden, you automatically reveal your presence. You can attempt a Concealment Test as a Half Action to duck back under cover, but your opponents gain a +20 bonus to their Awareness Tests.

**Taking Time to Hide:** Normally a Concealment Test is a Half Action, representing you ducking behind cover or out of sight. However, if you take longer to conceal yourself, you have a better chance of remaining hidden. For every additional five minutes you take to hide yourself (or another), you gain a +10 bonus to the Concealment Test, to a maximum of +30 for taking 15 minutes to hide.
## **Contortionist 
(Basic, Movement) 
Agility**

The Contortionist skill is used to wriggle free from bonds, squeeze through a narrow opening, or slip out of chains. A skilled contortionist is not only harder to pin down, capture, or generally tie up, but can reach places others can’t follow.

The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Escape Bonds:** Whenever you attempt to slip free from any kind of bonds, you make a Contortionist Test. The Difficulty depends on the Intelligence of the person who secured you in the first place. If their Intelligence exceeds your Agility Characteristic, the Test is **Hard (–20)**. Other factors may worsen or diminish the Difficulty, such as whether simple riot cord or complicated Arbitrator magnacles were used, or whether you were hastily secured or your captor took his time to ensure that you could not escape. Escaping bonds requires one minute, with each degree of success reducing this time by 10 seconds.

**Escape Grapple:** When you have been Grappled in combat, you may use the Contortionist skill to escape. Make a Contortionist Test opposed by the grappler's Strength Test. If you win you break free, otherwise you remain Grappled. This is a Full Action when used during combat.

**Hiding in Odd Spaces:** You may make a Contortionist Test in place of a Concealment Test if you use the Skill to hide in an odd place, such as an air vent or oil drum.

**Slipperier than a Greased Kroot:** The contortionist’s life is made all the more easier with the help of some kind of slick material available, helping him to slip out of hitherto impossible bonds. If you can first lubricate your body in some way, such as with machine oil or cooking grease, you gain a +10 bonus to all Contortionist Tests.

**Squeeze through a Tight Space:** You can make a Contortionist Test to squeeze through a tight space, such as between the bars of your jail cell, past a cave-in blocking your path or through the air vents of a space hulk. The difficulty of the Test is set according to how tight the space is. The GM is well within his rights to rule that a space is simply too narrow to squeeze through, and common sense applies as always. Success allows you to squeeze through unhindered, whereas failure means that the opening is too narrow after all. If you fail by five or more degrees, you become stuck until you can pass a subsequent Contortionist Test or until someone helps you out of your predicament by dragging you out, greasing the passage and so on.

Most Contortionist Tests take one minute, with each degree of success reducing this time by ten seconds. Escaping a Grapple is a Full Action attempted during combat.
## **Deceive 
(Basic, Interaction) 
Fellowship**

Unlike the quick-fire distraction of Blather, Deceive is far subtler and more useful for deception over the long term. It can be used to convince an enemy that you are there to help, a guard that you really have just found the corpse in the room, or a merchant to invest his hard-earned
Thrones into your “scheme”. You make Deceive Tests whenever you would convince others of something that is not necessarily true, want to dupe them or otherwise swindle and mislead them. You need not make a Deceive Test every time you lie to an NPC; only when you want to change their opinions of you or convince them of something they're not otherwise apt to believe.

A Deceive Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus and your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say. Deceive is typically opposed by Scrutiny.

A Deceive Test typically takes one minute. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Acting:** When pretending to be someone other than who you are, such as when you use the Disguise skill, you may use Deceive to enhance your disguise. A successful Deceive Test opposed by your opponent’s Scrutiny grants you a +10 bonus to all Disguise Tests made for a number of minutes equal to your Fellowship Bonus. You may only use this feature if you are communicating with someone, and you must make a successful Deceive Test before Testing Disguise.

**Con:** The Deceive skill can be used to “con” a victim. When conning—that is, misleading him for any length of time for your own gain—you may make a Deceive Test in place of another Interaction Skill, such as Charm. Note that should the victim uncover your conning of him any drops in his Disposition towards you will likely be at least one step worse than if you had used another Interaction Skill.

**Defraud:** This expanded function works just like the Charm special rule **bamboozle** except it applies to Deceive Tests. See Charm above for details.

**Soothing Platitudes:** Not all lies are bad, and sometimes a tactful white lie here or there can smooth the way. You may make a Deceive Test to convince another character of some falsehood, whether in the form of a compliment or a plain deception. If you succeed on an Opposed Deceive Test against your opponent’s Scrutiny Test, you gain a +10 bonus on Interaction Tests against that target for a number of minutes equal to your Fellowship Bonus.
## **Demolition 
(Advanced, Crafting) 
Intelligence**

If you love to blow things up, as many Acolytes do—the constant drilling to be cautious and subtle by their masters—Demolition is useful to make sure you don't blow yourself up at the same time.  This skill is used to plant explosive devices and bombs. as well as to defuse them, and can also be used in the safe handling and manufacture of explosives. Demolition involves explosive devices that are planted or set, rather than those that are simply lobbed at the enemy, such as grenades.

A Demolition Test can take anywhere from a Full Action (setting a single melta bomb) to hours or even days (rigging a voidship plasma drive to explode) depending on the complexity of the task and the device in question. 
#### Planting Explosives
Explosive devices such as demolition charges, melta bombs and krak grenades are far more effective when planted on a target. To plant an explosive make a Demolition Test. Success indicates that you have successfully planted the explosive, with a trigger mechanism and condition of your choice. Possible triggers include timers, fuses, proximity sensors, remote controls, or tripwires, and may require additional materials or supplies beyond the explosive itself to set (such re-purposing a chrono for a timer or a screamer for a proximity sensor). Failure indicates that you believe the explosives to be planted properly, but when triggered they fail to go off. If you fail by five or more degrees, you accidentally set the explosives off yourself! Boom!
You may voluntarily make the Test more difficult, for example increasing the time to plant a bomb in a more vulnerable location. By doing so, the Damage dealt is increased by +2 for each level of Difficulty increased or additional minute spent setting the explosive (up to a maximum of +10).
For every degree of success on the Demolition Test, the explosive is harder to detect and to defuse. Note the number of degrees of success down when you plant an explosive—it will be used in any Opposed Tests made to defuse or discover the bomb.
#### Defusing Explosives
A character can also use the Demolition skill to defuse a bomb. To defuse a bomb before it explodes requires you to make an Opposed Demolition Test against the Demolition Test of the character who set the bomb in the first place. Success means that the bomb has been defused in time. Failure means that you have not disarmed the bomb yet, although in all but a catastrophic failure you can try again next Round, if you still have the time. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that you have accidentally set the bomb off by mistake!
#### Ancillary Uses of Demolition
Aside from planting and defusing explosives, Demolition can also be used for a variety of other purposes:

**Booby-Traps:** An explosive can be used as a trap, such as by rigging a frag grenade with a tripwire, or hiding a shredder mine with a photosensor under a rug. When an explosive has been set to be “victim-activated”, the victim is entitled to an Awareness Test, opposed by your Demolitions Test, to see if he's about to blow himself up. The explosive is otherwise set as normal; see **Planting Explosives** above.

**Detecting Explosives:** Normally an explosive device is located using the Awareness skill (to physically notice the device) or Security skill (to detect it using sensors). You may instead use the Demolition skill to find an explosive device, utilising your own knowledge of planting explosives to find the most effective places where it could be set. In all cases, the Test to detect the explosive is Opposed by the Demolition Test made to plant the explosive.

**Explosive Entry:** Sometimes, when there isn’t enough time to bypass a lock manually or a doorway proves too much of an obstacle, a well-placed explosive charge will do just fine. Assuming you have sufficient explosives to destroy the locking mechanism, you may make a Demolition Test instead of a Security Test to bypass the aforementioned lock. A single krak grenade is typically more than enough for most portals you'd encounter in a hive city, while something more powerful would likely be needed for a reinforced vault door or the head of a plasma reactor. Success indicates that the lock or door is destroyed, allowing access, but probably alerting anyone nearby that something's afoot. Failure indicates that the lock is destroyed but the door remains sealed, the explosives failed to detonate, or that the explosion emanates outwards instead of inwards, catching anyone nearby in the blast.

**Manufacture Explosives:** Given enough time and resources you may use the Demolition skill to make an explosive device from base ingredients and components, or rig an otherwise normal powered or chemically-driven device to explode. The Difficulty of the Test varies according to what ingredients you have available and how long you have to manufacture it. Rigging a frag grenade to explode as soon as the pin is pulled is a relatively simple matter, building a melta bomb from scratch is considerably harder. Generally, manufacturing explosives uses the rules for Crafting items described on page 96.

**Repurpose Explosive:** Instead of defusing a bomb you can also alter its trigger mechanism so that it detonates when you want it to, rather than when the original demolitionist wanted. Resolve this as an Opposed Demolitions Test, with a success on your part allowing you to reset the bomb as if you had planted it, thereby allowing you to make all decisions about the explosive as normal. A failed Test indicates that you are unable to alter the explosive without first defusing it. A catastrophic failure by five or more degrees indicates that the bomb goes off immediately. Note that you may need to provide additional materials if you wish to change the mechanism by which the bomb goes off.
## **Disguise
(Basic) 
Fellowship**

Whether pretending to be the servant of a corrupt noble, infiltrating a sinister cult, or lying low in a vile dive, the Disguise skill is handy for helping you be someone you’re not. Of course, there is more to a good disguise than appearances, but this Skill goes a long way to giving you the best possible chance of remaining undetected.

Although not strictly required, a disguise kit of some kind is highly recommended if you wish to make a convincingly altered appearance. Generally speaking, Disguise is an Opposed Skill Test against the Scrutiny of anyone trying to see through your ruse.

The time it takes to create a disguise varies greatly depending on its complexity, but it usually requires a minimum of one minute to don a simple disguise. 

The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Disguise Voice:** You can use the Disguise skill to alter your voice so that you sound like someone else. If you simply want to change the tone of your voice in a way that you are unrecognisable, simply Test Disguise as normal. If you want to alter your voice so that it matches someone else, you must spend at least a week (minus your Intelligence Bonus in days) training your voice by listening to and replicating recordings of the specific voice. Impersonating a voice is a **Difficult (-10) Test**, unless the person is particularly well known, in which case it becomes a **Hard (–20) Test.

**Impersonation:** Generally, a Disguise Test allows you to pretend to be a nameless, faceless individual, someone that may fit with expectations for a particular location or area. Such anonymity is useful in getting into places where ordinarily you couldn’t, but sometimes even a good disguise is not enough. Sometimes you must become someone else. You may use Disguise to impersonate another person. You must have prosthetics, a pict or holo-pict of the person’s likeness, and other useful tools. Impersonating a specific person is a **Hard (–20) Test**, unless the person is particularly well known, in which case it becomes a **Very Hard (–30) Test**.

**Look the Part:** With an appropriate disguise, you can make your lies easier to digest, such as disguising yourself as a messenger when trying to bluff your way past the guards on the front door. If you make a successful Disguise Test you may gain a +10 bonus to any related Deceive Tests, so long as the disguise makes the deceit all the more believable.
## **Dodge 
(Basic, Combat) 
Agility**

If you're the sort who fights for a living, being able to leap out of the way of lasbolt or flying punches is a vital Skill for your survival. 

You may use the Dodge skill once per Round to negate a successful melee or ranged attack. Once a hit is scored, but before Damage is rolled, you can try to Dodge—note that you must be aware of an attack if you wish to Dodge it. If your Dodge Test succeeds, you get out of the way at the last minute and the attack inflicts no Damage. If you fail the Test, the attack connects and your opponent may roll for Damage as usual. You may Dodge both melee and ranged attacks.

A Dodge Test is a Reaction. 
##### Example
*It seems that the barman has taken exception to Drake’s treatment of his paying customers and on his Initiative, starts combat by swinging at the Guardsman with a shock maul. The barman makes a Weapon Skill Test and hits. Drake can Test Dodge to get out of the way. He rolls the dice and compares the result to his Agility. He succeeds and manages to duck beneath the arc of the shock maul.*
#### **Dodging Auto-Fire and Area Effect Attacks**
Some attacks are more difficult to Dodge either because they cover a large area, like a grenade or flamer, or because they throw out large amounts of rounds, like a weapon fired with a Full or Semi-Automatic Burst.

When Dodging an area effect weapon, a successful Dodge Test will move the character to the edge of the area of effect, **as long as it is no further away than their Agility Bonus in metres**. If they would need to move further than this to avoid the attack then the Dodge Test automatically fails. You can still move up to your Agility Bonus in metres, but will suffer the Damage from the attack regardless.

When Dodging Full or Semi-Automatic fire, each degree of success negates an additional hit.
##### Example
*Father Horst is surprised by a mutant trooper with an autogun sneaking into the far end of his chapel-trench. The mutant has the drop on Father Horst, and so gets a Full Turn to act before*
*Father Horst can do anything.*
*The debased-looking trooper uses his Turn to spray a Full Auto Burst (a Full Action) at Father Horst. The mutant gains +20 to his Ballistic Skill of 30 because of the sheer number of slugs his autogun is hurling. The mutant scores a 39 on his Test—a hit! As he has one degree of success (50–39=11) the trooper has managed to score one additional hit.
*Being a sensible soul, Father Horst decides use his Reaction to try and Dodge the Full Auto Burst. Father Horst Tests against his Agility of 40, and scores a 17. As this grants two degrees of success (40–17=23) Father Horst can escape two of the mutant’s hits. Somehow, Father Horst has avoided all Damage—a miracle!*
##### Dive for Cover
Whenever you are allowed to make a Dodge Test to negate an attack, you may instead make a **Difficult (–10) Dodge Test** to dive behind cover. To use this feature, an available piece of cover must be within two metres of you. If the Test succeeds, you not only negate the attack, but also move behind the covering obstacle.
##### Protect Ally
You may also use Dodge to put yourself in the path of an attack made against an ally. Whenever you are adjacent to an ally and that ally is attacked, you may make a **Difficult (–10) Dodge Test** to swap your position with that of your ally. If the Test succeeds, you are attacked instead.
## **Drive 
(Advanced, Operator) 
Agility**

**Skill Group:** Ground Vehicle, Hover Vehicle, Walker

The Drive skill is used to control autos, trucks, landspeeders and other land-based or hover vehicles. Driving under normal conditions does not require a Test. However, Tests may be called for when navigating treacherous terrain, going at excessive speed or attempting dangerous manoeuvres. Opposed Drive Tests are made between pursuers and pursued during a chase.

A Drive Test is typically a Half Action, but certain manoeuvres may require more or less time. The following special rules are associated with this skill: 

**Hiding in Traffic:** Sometimes, when you’re being pursued in a vehicle, the easiest place to lose pursuers is to hide in plain sight—in traffic. So long as there are lots of other similar vehicles to hide amongst, you may make a Drive Test in place of a Concealment Test to Oppose your pursuers’ Awareness Test to spot you, driving casually and blending in with the traffic.

**Forcing Another Vehicle to a Halt:** If you are close to another vehicle that is the same size or smaller, and you are both going at the same speed, you may make an Opposed Drive Test to force the other vehicle to a halt. If you succeed, the other driver must brake to avoid hitting you, is forced off the road or brought to a halt by virtue of colliding with your own vehicle. This may inflict Damage on one or both vehicles, but either way the vehicle is stopped. If you fail, it is your vehicle that is brought to sudden halt, letting the other vehicle escape unhindered.
## **Evaluate 
(Basic, Investigation) 
Intelligence**

You can use Evaluate to determine the approximate value of everyday objects, as well as valuables such as archeotech and other objects d'art. A successful Test reveals the item's market price and possibly a little bit about the item itself. Since a failed Test may result in the miscalculation of an item's true value, it is recommended that the GM rolls Evaluate Tests in secret and tells the player what his character believes to be true.

Evaluating an item usually takes at least one minute, although the GM may decide to give a bonus if the character takes more time or a penalty if he simply gives it a quick once over.

A successful Evaluate Test can be used in conjunction with the Barter skill, with every degree of success granting you a +10 bonus on a Barter Test to purchase or sell the evaluated item.
## **Forbidden Lore 
(Advanced, Investigation) 
Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** The Black Library, Cults, Daemonology, Heresy, Inquisition, Archeotech, Mutants, Ordos, Adeptus Mechanicus, Psykers, Pirates, Warp and Xenos.

Forbidden Lore skills represent dangerous, sometimes heretical knowledge gleaned from the myriad of unconventional sources an Acolyte may often finds in his possession. This Skill represents a combination of scholarly learning and knowledge gained through practical experience. Simply possessing the Forbidden Lore skill is often sufficient to warrant investigation at the hands of the Inquisition, and a character must tread carefully when revealing such knowledge. Most Inquisitors might try to school their Acolytes in treating Forbidden Lore with caution and care; many don't listen and often find out more than they probably should. The wariest of Acolytes keep this knowledge safe for times of great need—the more foolhardy are liable to find themselves in trouble indeed.

When making a Forbidden Lore Test, you recall basic information about the subject. Each degree of success reveals a bit more information as determined by the GM.

A character that learns the Forbidden Lore skill in play, or who uses it to gain some insight into the mysteries of the galaxy, may also gain a number of Corruption or Insanity Points, depending on the danger the knowledge represents, at the GM's discretion. Some lores are more dangerous than others, but all have at least some potential to turn the righteous away from the God-Emperor's light. Some Forbidden Lore Skill Groups are described as follows:

**Archeotech:** Knowledge of the great tech devices of ancient times and clues to their function and purpose.

**Adeptus Mechanicus:** An understanding of the followers of the Machine God, including such things as their observances, common beliefs and core philosophies.

**The Black Library:** Secret knowledge of the Black Library, its forbidden contents, strange industries and the unspeakable pale, hairless things that toil within its walls.

**Cults:** Knowledge of the most notorious Imperial Cults and some of their sub-sects and splinter cabals.

**Daemonology:** Terrible comprehension of some of the recorded warp entities and their various manifestations.

**Heresy:** Unpleasant appreciation for those acts and practices deemed heretical by the Imperium.

**Inquisition:** A general understanding (often based on hearsay and rumour) of that most terrible and secret of organisations known as the Inquisition.

**Mutants:** Covering the study of both stable and unstable mutations and some of their more unfortunate results.

**Ordos:** Either Malleus, Hereticus or Xenos and granting some slightly more specialised knowledge of that particular ordo's practices.

**Psykers:** Skill in identifying the signs of psykers as well as the results of their powers and the extent of their capabilities.

**Pirates:** Knowledge of the scourge of warp lanes, their tactics, infamous vessels, and inhuman captains.

**Warp:** An understanding of the ways of the warp, especially its interaction with realspace and how its tides and eddies can affect travel between the stars.

**Xenos:** Knowledge of the most commonly encountered species of aliens within the Imperium.

Using Forbidden Lore takes no time at all. You either know something or you do not, although the consequences for knowing such things can last a lifetime….

Other than knowledge of things best left unknown, Forbidden Lore can be used in several other areas that may be useful during an investigation:

**Forbidden Goods:** You may make a Forbidden Lore Test instead of an Evaluate Test, to calculate the (often priceless) value of a forbidden artefact or try to learn something about its history or purpose. Of course, peddling forbidden artefacts is often treated as a worse crime than simply possessing them, usually ending in execution... or worse.

**Forbidden Procedures:** A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing when dealing with forbidden lore, but can still ingratiate you with an organisation all the quicker. You may make a relevant Forbidden Lore Test prior to dealing with members of an organisation. If successful you gain a +10 bonus to Interaction Tests made when dealing with them. Just try not to forget your true allegiances whilst in close contact with cultists...
## **Gamble 
(Basic) 
Intelligence**

Whilst some Inquisitors would view playing cards and rolling dice as a waste of time, others concede it can be a great way to get in with the right circles, to say nothing of passing the time between missions. The Gamble skill is used to participate in games of chance, such as card games or crude (and often violent) dice games popular amongst the lower classes. Each participant in a game wagers the same amount and makes an Opposed Gamble Test. The player with the most degrees of success (or fewest degrees of failure) wins the pot. You may, at your option, choose to throw the game, in which case you lose automatically.

You may also opt to use Sleight of Hand instead of Gamble to hide cards up your sleeve or palm dice. Success gives you a +20 bonus to your Gamble Test. However, failing by five or more degrees indicates that your ruse is revealed with predictably unpleasant consequences. If you don't mind being possibly uninvited to future games, you may make a Difficult (-10) Intimidate Test to convince the other players that there are worse consequences than losing money if they don't let you win. On a success you gain a +5 bonus on related Gamble Tests. On a failure, the other players take a dim view of your bluster and you suffer a -5 penalty on these Tests for the rest of the game.

Making a Gamble Test can represent anything from controlling a single hand of cards to an entire day spent gaming. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Off Guard:** A wily Acolyte catches others off guard by lulling them into a false sense of security with an innocent game of chance. You may make a Gamble Test to calm down tensions and ingratiate yourself with others. If successful, you gain a +10 bonus to your next interaction or Inquiry Test made with them, as they are likely to be more disposed towards you.

**Risk:** Life is a gamble, and your familiarity around the gaming table and understanding of the odds can aid you outside of a game of tiles. As a Full Action in combat, you may attempt a **Hard (–20) Gamble Test**. On a success, you gain a +10 bonus that can apply to any one Test made for the duration of the encounter. On a failure, you take a –10 penalty that applies to a single Test made during the encounter as determined by the GM. You may only use Risk once per encounter.
## **Inquiry 
(Basic, Investigation) 
Fellowship**

As an agent of the Inquisition, your principle responsibility is investigation, seeking out the heretic and witch and bringing them to justice. Inquiry is a vital tool regardless of your career since it enables you to get a sense of the environment, learn clues and aid you in your ongoing search for enemies of the Imperium. The Inquiry skill is your ability to pick up rumours, secrets and guarded information by asking questions, buying drinks and generally watching and listening for anything of interest that might bubble up. Inquiry can be used in several ways. The first and most common way is to pick up general information about local developments. A successful Test reveals basic information, with additional and higher-quality intelligence with each degree of success.

Inquiry can also be used as an Investigation skill, wherein you might be chasing after a particular fact or secret. For more information on investigation, see **Playing the Game - Investigation.** Furthermore, it is the primary means by which you ascertain the availability of items and gear you may wish to purchase or otherwise acquire—an exceedingly useful skill indeed.

Making an Inquiry Test usually represents an hour or so of activity, but may represent a much longer or shorter period as circumstances dictate. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Asking Around:** You may make an Inquiry Test to find out if anyone has been asking questions about you, your colleagues or anything else you might be on the hunt for. This is Opposed by the Inquiry Test of anyone asking such questions. 

**False Rumours:** Just as you rely on rumours to find answers, so to can you plant false rumours to throw an enemy off your trail. You may make an Inquiry Test to plant such rumours for others to discover. A successful Test increases the Difficulty of your opponent’s Inquiry Test by one plus one-step for each degree of success.

**Lines of Inquiry:** You can use Inquiry as a very light and subtle form of interrogation, attempting to find information by asking seemingly innocent questions of the subject. In place of an Interrogation Test, you may instead make a **Hard (–20) Inquiry Test**. You are never at risk of inflicting Fatigue or Damage with this Test.
## **Interrogation 
(Advanced, Investigation) 
Willpower**

The key tool in an Inquisitor's arsenal is interrogation—the ability to extract quality information from an unwilling subject. There is a fine line between interrogation and crude torture. In the case of the latter, subjects tend to reveal whatever their tormenter wishes to hear, but in the case of the former, a skilled interrogator can tease out the darkest secrets by utilising a variety of devices, serums and techniques.

Gear, environmental conditions and circumstances can all apply additional modifiers at the GM's discretion. Make an Opposed Test, pitting your Interrogation skill against your opponent's Willpower. If you beat your opponent, you get one answer plus one other answer for each degree of success. If your opponent wins the Opposed Test, you get nothing of worth. On a serious failure, you botch the procedure and inflict 1d10 plus your Willpower Bonus in Damage. If you fail by five or more degrees, you deal Damage as before but your subject gains a +30 bonus to Willpower Tests made to resist Interrogation.

Each Interrogation Test inflicts one level of Fatigue on the target. An Interrogation Test consumes 1d5 hours of time.
## **Intimidate 
(Basic, Interaction) 
Various**

You make Intimidate Tests whenever you want to coerce or frighten individuals or a small group. You need not make an Intimidate Test every time you make a threat. Usually Intimidate is backed up by Strength, but more subtle threats such as blackmail may use Intelligence or Fellowship at the GM's option. The more degrees of success, the more frightened your opponent becomes.

An Intimidate Test can affect a number of targets equal to your Strength Bonus, Intelligence Bonus, or Fellowship Bonus, depending on the Characteristics you are using for your Test. In addition, your targets must be able to see and hear you clearly, and understand what you say.

An Intimidate Test is a Full Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Carry a Big Gun:** You may back up your stern words with the threat of force, typically symbolised by a very large gun. So long as your weapon is bigger, or obviously deals more Damage, than anything your opponent has, you gain a +10 bonus on your Intimidation Test. Note this only applies when using Strength to make your Intimidation Test.

**FEAR THE INQUISITION!** You may make an Intimidation Test, coupled with liberal displays of authority and marks of office, to put the fear of the Inquisition into your opponent. On a successful Test you may add +10 to a subsequent Interrogation Test made against anyone who is at least familiar with the unpleasant rumours surrounding the Inquisition. Higher ranking members of the Inquisition, Daemon princes and Space Marine captains are less likely to be bothered by an Acolyte spouting such rhetoric, so the results of the Test are subject to the GMs discretion.

**Fearsome Glare:** Normally, using Intimidate is a Full Action, but sometimes you need to cow your opponent quickly to keep the target in place while attending to a more significant threat. You may Test Intimidate as a Half Action, but the Difficulty worsens by one-step. Furthermore, if you succeed, the effects of the Test last for just 1 Round.

**Scare Factor:** Whilst Intimidate normally requires you to be able to make yourself understood, you can attempt to scare or cow a group of people or creatures who do not speak your language (or any language) by the power of gesture and shouting alone. Using Intimidate in this way requires at least a **Difficult (–10) Test**.

**Obey My Command!** You may abandon the tactfulness of command and resort to fear to ensure that your underlings obey. If you succeed on a Difficult (–10) Intimidate Test, you get a +5 bonus on all Command Tests against targets you intimidated for a number of minutes equal to your Strength Bonus. A failed Test indicates that you take a –5 penalty on such Tests.
## **Invocation 
(Advanced) 
Willpower**

Whilst it is not always possible to take the time to properly focus a Psychic Power, most psykers would strongly urge a budding Acolyte to make the time. Psykers who might have advocated the opposite, urging a carefree approach, are rarely sane enough to offer such advice.

An Invocation Test allows you to boost your Power Roll when using Psychic Powers. During this time, you clear your mind through various means, such as muttering mantras, meditating, fingering psychic-foci and so on. A successful Test indicates that your mind is well prepared to touch the warp. On the next Round, you may add your Willpower Bonus to your Power Roll twice instead of the usual once.

Failure on an Invocation Test indicates that you are not composed enough to gain any benefits from your preparations. If you make a successful Invocation Test and then do not take the Focus Power Action before the end of your next Turn there are no other side effects (aside from you possibly looking a little foolish).

You may also use Invocation to draw psychic wards and sigils about you, summon up your mental energies and fortify your will against attack. Doing so requires an Invocation Test, and if successful you gain a +10 bonus for every degree of success to the next Willpower Test made to resist a Psychic Power. A failure by three or more degrees indicates you have botched the wards in a significant way, imposing a –10 penalty to your next Test instead. For every degree of failure above three, the penalty worsens by an additional –10.

An Invocation Test is a Full Action. 
##### Example
*Doc Skul decides to visit the Inflict Pain Minor Psychic Power on his hated rival, Slippery Zim. He spends a full Turn shaking his bone rattle and muttering spitefully under his breath as part of his Invocation Test. He rolls to see if these preparations will help him Focus Power. He rolls 15—a success! On the following Round, he attempts to manifest Inflict Pain. He gets 4 on his Power Roll and adds his Willpower Bonus of 3 to this as normal. Because of his successful Invocation, he may now add an additional 3 points to this roll. In total, Doc Skul has made a Power Roll of 10 (4+3+3=10). His Focus Power Action succeeds, and Slippery Zim doubles over in pain!*
## **Lip Reading 
(Advanced) 
Perception**

While far less technical than a surveillance auspex or vox-thief, the Lip Reading skill is a fairly effective way of “listening” in to the conversations of others, useful for undercover Acolytes or those caught unprepared.

Use the Lip Reading skill to eavesdrop on conversations that take place out of earshot. To use this Skill, you must have an unobstructed view of the speaker's mouth and you must also be able to understand the language spoken. Distance is the biggest factor. The further away the subject is, the harder the Test. The base Difficulty is **Challenging (+0)**, but it worsens by one step for every ten metres of distance. Note that equipment that magnifies vision can be used to offset this penalty, and even provide bonuses.

A successful Test reveals the general gist of the conversation, such as the person is talking about the weather, new tariffs at the space dock, and so on. Each degree of success reveals more specific details.

A Lip Reading Test is a Full Action, though it lasts as long as the target speaks.

You may use your Lip Reading skill to communicate discretely with another person in your line of sight, either hiding coded messages in regular conversation or mouthing a message to them. You only need to make a Lip Reading Test to hide words in normal conversation, not to simply mouth a message, but the recipient must make a Lip Reading Test either way to successfully interpret the message. If either Test is failed then the message is not conveyed properly.
##### Example
*Mattheus and Ruthe are undercover at the Governor’s ball. Mattheus is trying to mouth the words “get out, they’ve spotted you” to his colleague across the other side of the room. If he mouths the words to Ruthe, only Ruthe needs to make a Lip Reading Test. However, this might prove to be a bit obvious, so whilst in conversation with the Governor’s wife, he may try to include the message in his conversation for Ruthe to see, in which case both Mattheus and Ruthe must make a Lip Reading Test. Both pass the Test and Ruthe gets out just in time!*
## **Literacy 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

The Literacy skill enables you to read any language you can speak. Normally a passive skill, you do not need to Test Literacy for everyday instances of reading or writing. The GM may call for a Literacy Test when you attempt to read a challenging dialect or poor penmanship, or decipher obscure phraseology, archaic usage, and unusual idioms. 

To read one page of text—approximately 750 words—a Literacy Test takes about a minute. If you don't have the luxury of time, you make attempt a **Difficult (–10) Literacy Test** to “speed read” written material, cutting down the time to read a page of text down to a single Round. This represents a very brief skimming of the document, and you are unable to get more than a rough sense of meaning or find a specific phrase or section by doing this.
## **Logic 
(Basic, Investigation) 
Intelligence**

Inquisitors value servants with the ability to crack mathematical formulae, codes and other puzzles, and those with extensive training in Logic can rise far—provided they keep their keen minds where they belong and do not dabble too far into the forbidden.

Logic represents your proficiency at mathematics and your ability at problem solving. Logic Tests might be made to decipher a code or to solve a particularly troublesome equation. Logic is also used by Tech-Priests to incant mathematical rituals on machinery. Note that Logic is a purely theoretical or abstract Skill—Tech-Use is its practical counterpart.

A Logic Test usually takes one minute of pondering and thinking, although especially difficult problems might require much longer. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Analysing Clues:** Late in an investigation, once the clues are all in place, you may use your Logic skill to try to put it all together and bring the investigation to a conclusion. You may use Logic as an Investigation Skill, making a Logic Test alongside another Investigation Skill Test. If both are successful, you may roll an additional 1d10 and subtract the roll from the amount of time taken to carry out the investigation.

**Code Cracking:** You may use Logic as an Investigation Skill when attempting to decipher a cipher. See the Ciphers skill above for more information on how to do this.

**Epiphany:** Once per game session, when you are stumped at an impasse or otherwise confronted with a problem you can’t quite overcome, you may make a **Very Hard (–30) Logic Test** to conjure up an idea from the depths of your mind. On a success, the GM may grant you a hint, nudge you in the right direction or offer some other previously overlooked clue to aid you in your investigation.

**Mathemechanica Rituals:** Tech-priests know the mathemechanical formulae to coax a machine-spirit into behaving itself. You may make a Logic Test to recall the correct rituals and incantations, and, if successful, gain +10 to a Tech-Use Test made at the same time. Alternatively, you may use your Logic to assist another Acolyte’s Tech-Use skill.

**Sooth Machine-Spirits:** You know the rites and rituals to placate an angry machine-spirit, coaxing it to cooperate. In the event of a weapon or equipment malfunction or Jamming, you may make a **Difficult (–10) Logic Test** to coax the machine-spirit into behaving itself. If the Test is successful, the weapon does not Jam or the piece of equipment does not malfunction.
## **Medicae 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

Injury comes with the job of being an Acolyte and, for this reason, teams would be well-advised include at least one member with some familiarity with Medicae, or at least have access to someone who does. Medicae enables you to patch up comrades, pull an ally from the brink of death, administer drugs, diagnose an ongoing affliction, and point out the best place to stick a needle to cause optimum pain. 

The following special rules are associated with this skill:
##### **First Aid**

Likely the most common use of the Medicae skill as far as Acolytes are concerned, First Aid offers a quick fix for injured or dying characters. First Aid is usually a Full Action, both for you and your patient. The difficulty of a Medicae Test to provide First Aid depends on the severity as well as the type of Damage which inflicted the injury being treated:

| Injury Level |      Energy      |    Explosive    |      Impact      |     Rending      |
| :----------: | :--------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |
|    Light     | Challenging (+0) | Difficult (–10) |  Ordinary (+10)  | Challenging (+0) |
|    Heavy     | Difficult (–10)  |   Hard (–20)    | Challenging (+0) | Difficult (–10)  |
|   Critical   |    Hard (–10)    | Very Hard (–30) | Difficult (–10)  |    Hard (–20)    |
A Medicae Test to render First Aid is made to repair a specific set of injuries, each Test attending to a particular type of harm. The Injury Level applies to total Damage taken, so even if the target only took 1 point of Energy Damage and 6 points of Explosive Damage, that same target would still count as Heavily Injured for all Medicae Tests to render First Aid.

A successful Medicae Test to render First Aid removes Damage from an injured character as follows:

| Injury Level | Damaged Removed |
| :----------: | :-------------: |
|    Light     |    Int Bonus    |
|    Heavy     |     1 Point     |
|   Critical   |     1 Point     |

On a failure, the patient is not adversely affected, and simply removes Damage at the natural healing rate. However, a failure by three or more degrees indicates that Lightly or Heavily Wounded take a point of Damage, whilst a character on 0 Wounds must succeed on an immediate Toughness Test or die.

**Limitations of First Aid:** A character can receive First Aid one time for each type of Damage taken—a character who has taken only Explosive Damage can only receive First Aid once, while a character who has taken Energy and Explosive Damage could received two uses of First Aid, one for each set of injuries. When treating a character who has suffered multiple types of Damage you must declare which injury you're treating with each use of First Aid.

Once the Medicae Test is performed the injury is treated, for better or worse, and cannot be tended to again with another use of First Aid. If you wish to provide further treatment see the **Extended Care** special rule below.
###### Example
*When Julius takes a nasty hit from a laspistol and falls to the ground, a curl of smoke rising from the burn hole through his chest, Lucian rushes to his ally’s side. Looking him over, he sees he’s taken Critical Damage and can’t take another hit. Since Julius has taken Critical Energy Damage, Lucian has to pass a **Difficult (–10) Medicae Test** to remove 1 point of Damage. It’s not much, but it might give his ally a chance to survive the firefight.*
##### **Extended Care**

After rendering First Aid, Extended Care can be used to speed the healing process of the rest of your patient's injuries. As with First Aid, the difficulty of the Medicae Test is determined by the Damage type which inflicted the injury. Use the predominant Damage type to determine the base Difficulty (e.g. the type of Damage that affects the patient the most); if the patient is suffering from multiple Damage types, increase the Difficulty by one-step for each additional type of Damage suffered beyond the first.

| Damage Type | Extended Care Difficulty |
| ----------- | :----------------------: |
| Energy      |     Challenging (+0)     |
| Explosive   |     Difficult (–10)      |
| Impact      |      Ordinary (+10)      |
| Rending     |     Challenging (+0)     |

You can attend a number of patients equal to your Intelligence Bonus; each patient above this number imposes a cumulative –10 penalty to your Medicae Tests to provide Extended Care. You may perform Extended Care for all of your patients with a single Medicae Test, using the worst Difficulty as a baseline. Alternatively, you may Test Medicae for each patient separately—this may be preferable if one patient is far more injured than the rest.

For Lightly Wounded patients make one Test at the end of each day. For Heavily or Critically Wounded patients, Test once at the end of each week. 

On a success, your patient removes twice the normal Damage (removing Critical Damage first then normal Damage), plus 1 Damage for each degree of success. On a failure, your patients are not adversely affected and remove Damage at the normal rates. A failure by three or more degrees indicates that all Lightly Wounded or Heavily Wounded characters take 1 Damage—use Sudden Death to resolve Critical Damage. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that all patients take 1d10 Damage—again, use Sudden Death to resolve Critical Damage.
###### Example
*Doctor Phelps attends four patients. His Intelligence Bonus is 3, so he takes a –10 penalty to his Medicae Tests to treat these patients from the start. Two patients have Energy Damage, so his Tests to provide Extended Care are at the base –10 penalty. One patient has Explosive Damage, so Doctor Phelps must succeed on a **Hard (–20) Medicae Test** to provide extended care to this poor soul. The worst-off patient took Energy, Impact and Rending Damage, the most of which was Rending. He’s at –10 to start, +0 for Rending, and –20 for two additional Damage types for a total of –30. It doesn’t look good for this soldier.*
##### **Ancillary Uses of Medicae**

**Diagnose:** You can diagnose what’s wrong with a patient by succeeding on a Medicae Test. The GM rolls for you in secret. A success reveals the most basic trouble, with each degree of success revealing an additional useful fact. A failure reveals nothing, while a failure by three or more degrees results in a misdiagnosis with often spectacularly awful results if the physician is allowed to treat the patient. Examples include poisoning, lopping off the incorrect limb, replacing organs unnecessarily and so on.

**Pharmacy:** When administering a drug or treating a poison with Chem-Use, you may first make a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to bring to bear your Medicae knowledge. On a success, you gain a +5 bonus to the Chem-Use Test. On a failure by three or more degrees you take a –5 penalty instead.
## **Navigation 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Surface, Stellar.

Whether using a simple map and archeocompass, an innate knowledge of the landscape or the stars themselves, an Acolyte with the Navigation skill is rarely lost.

You employ the Navigation skill whenever you want to use maps, technical readouts, innate knowledge, or landmarks to chart a proper course and avoid becoming lost. A successful Navigation Test can also estimate travel times based on geography, cosmography, time of year, weather and so on. Under normal circumstances, a single successful Test each day is sufficient to keep you on track, though the GM may call for additional Tests if there are unusual conditions, such as fluctuating landmasses, swirling eddies of plasma or violent storms.

**Surface Navigation** is used to navigate across a planet's surface, using logi-compasses, map readouts and geographical knowledge.

**Stellar Navigation** is used to navigate in the void between planets, using star charts and cartomantic rituals.

A Navigation Test usually represents several hours of charting courses, consulting maps and making heading corrections, but it may take one minute or less if its purpose is just to find out where you are.

The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Throwing off Pursuers:** Knowledge of the landscape coupled with careful planning allows you to plot a route designed to lose any pursuers. You may make a Navigation Test to assist a Tracking or Concealment Test made to lose a pursuer.

**Tracking in Space:** By using stellar cartography, calculating ship velocity and headings, and analysing recent disturbances, you can attempt to track the movements of a spacecraft. You may make a **Difficult (–10) Navigation (Stellar)** **Test** to track a spacecraft in the same way you would use the Tracking skill to track a creature over land.
## **Performer 
(Advanced) 
Fellowship**

**Skill Group:** Dancer, Musician, Singer, Storyteller. Others may be available with the GM's discretion.

Use the Performer skill to entertain and enthral crowds of spectators. The Performer skill may be used to earn an income, much as with Trade. At the GM's discretion, Performer may also be used in place of certain other Interaction skills—generally in circumstances where the audience would be amenable to such entertainment.

**Charming Performance:** You may make a **Difficult (–10) Performer (Storyteller)** or **Performer (Singer) Test** instead of Charm, to win round your audience, causing them to respond more favourably to you.

**Enthralling Performance:** You may make a **Difficult (–10) Performer (Musician)** or **Performer (Singer) Test** instead of Blather, thoroughly distracting your audience for a moment. This use is subject to the normal rules governing the Blather skill. Provided you take no other Actions you may continue to distract your audience for a number of Rounds up to your Fellowship Bonus.

**Innuendo:** You may convey secret messages in your stories and songs. You may make a **Difficult (–10) Performer (Singer or Storyteller) Test** instead of a Cipher or Secret Tongue Test. The recipient of the message must have the correct Skill to comprehend the meaning as normal.

A Performer Test can take a variable amount of time depending upon the performance in question. A short poem or parable might only last a few Rounds, while an elaborate and long-winded opera could take an hour or more.
## **Pilot 
(Advanced, Operator) 
Agility**

**Skill Group:** Civilian Craft, Military Craft, Spacecraft.

Whether snaking a lander through a hail of lasfire, or expertly piloting a guncutter in pursuit of a renegade ship, a skilled pilot is a vital component of nearly every Inquisitor’s retinue. The Pilot skill is used to fly anything from small atmospheric craft such as ornithopters and landers, all the way up to void-capable assault boats and bombers. Piloting a ship under normal conditions does not require a Test. However, Tests may be called for when flying in conditions such as storms, going at excessive speed, or attempting dangerous manoeuvres.

The handling characteristics of an individual vehicle are represented by its Manoeuvrability, which provides a modifier (either positive or negative) to the driver’s Drive or Pilot Skill while operating said vehicle. This modifier is applied whenever a Drive or Pilot Test is made using the vehicle.

When chasing another vehicle, you and your opponent make Opposed Pilot Tests.

A Pilot Test is typically a Half Action, but certain manoeuvres may require more or less time. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Shake Down:** A popular manoeuvre for when a vessel has unwelcome intruders aboard is for the pilot to jolt or jar the craft in such a way as to force all unsecured passengers to lose their footing. If the defenders can be forewarned somehow, this can give them an advantage in a fight. You make a Pilot Test, opposed by an Agility Test by everyone caught unawares. If successful, the hapless victim is knocked over and must spend his next Round getting up again.

**Shadowing in a Vehicle:** You may make a **Difficult (–10) Drive** or **Pilot Test** instead of a Shadowing Test when following another creature or vehicle in your own vehicle. Success does not necessarily mean your vehicle goes unnoticed, but it does mean that it appears inconspicuous.
## **Psyniscience 
(Advanced) 
Perception**

The Psyniscience skill is to psykers what Awareness is to “blunt“ Acolytes. It allows them to detect nearby psychic disturbances and such forewarning allows them to avoid being surprised by a Daemon or other psyker.

You can use the Psyniscience skill to become attuned with the ebb and flow of the warp and the immaterium. To do so, make a Psyniscience Test. On a success, you extend your senses out to a number of metres equal to your Perception Bonus plus 1d10. Each degree of success allows you to add 1d10+PB metres to your roll.

You can also Test to detect unusual psychic phenomena, areas where realspace has been "disrupted", areas where the immaterium seems to be blocked (or shielded against), and so on. The GM may wish to make the Test in secret depending on just what it is that the psyker may detect.

The results of any Psyniscience Test are summarised on the following chart:

| Degrees of Success | Result                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard           | Awareness of immaterium disruption, number of psychic entities present |
| One                | Approximate direction of the phenomena or entities                     |
| Two                | Rough location of the entities affecting the immaterium                |
| Three+             | Exact position and general strength of the entities present            |
Using Psyniscience is a Full Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Diminish Psychic Attack:** Psyniscience allows you to perceive the intricate weaves of power involved in the manifestation of a Psychic Power. Whenever you are the target of a Psychic Power, you may make a **Very Hard (–30) Psyniscience Test**. If you succeed, you negate the effects of any of the power’s Overbleed.

**Sense Lifeforms:** Every living creature leaves a psychic signature in the warp, and careful use of Psyniscience can allow you to detect the presence or absence of normal creatures. You may make a **Difficult (–10) Psyniscience Test** in place of an Awareness Test.
## **Scholastic Lore 
(Advanced, Investigation)
Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Archaic, Astromancy, Beasts, Bureaucracy, Chymistry, Cryptology, Heraldry, Imperial Creed, Judgement, Legend, Numerology, Occult, Philosophy, Tactica Imperialis.

Many Acolytes spend a great deal of their life studying and researching, becoming experts in their field, from psykers with their insight of the occult and the warp, arbitrators with their deep knowledge of Imperial justice and law, and officers with their understanding of the minutiae of the Tactica Imperialis. Many Inquisitors subscribe to the motto “knowledge is power, guard it well,“ and they often surround themselves with adept Acolytes for just this reason.

The Scholastic Lore skill grants you knowledge of a particular scholarly subject. A successful Test enables you to recall pertinent facts, and—if you have access to the proper facilities or resources—to do research. Scholastic Lore represents a depth of learning far beyond Common Lore and it requires extensive study.

You make Scholastic Lore Tests to identify an object, creature or place that falls under your particular area of expertise. A successful Test about a subject related to your speciality reveals the basic information. Each degree of success reveals more information as follows:

| Degrees of Success | Result                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard           | Reveals basic information known to people of your training.                                     |
| One                | Reveals uncommonly known information, even among your peers.                                    |
| Two                | Reveals obscure information about the subject. Such information is known to but a few scholars. |
| Three+             | Reveals extremely obscure information, known only to a handful of experts.                      |
In some areas, Scholastic Lore overlaps with Common Lore and Forbidden Lore, but almost always represents a far greater—and more academic—level of study. A character with Common Lore (Imperial Creed) might understand the day-to-day rituals and prayers gained from living under the creed, whereas a character with Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) might be able to explain why such rituals exist and how they have changed over the millennia.

To recall a fact or titbit about the subject, a Scholastic Lore Test takes no time at all. You either know the fact or not. Researching, assuming you are in the proper environment to do so, takes far longer. In this case, you may make one Scholastic Lore Test every 1d10 hours. The most typical Scholastic Lore Skill Groups are described as follows:

**Archaic:** An understanding of the murky past of the Imperium and how the long millennia have changed the face of mankind.

**Astromancy:** A knowledge of stars, heavenly bodies and the nature of worlds, as well as theoretical understanding of how to use telescopes, astrolabes and so on.

**Beasts:** An understanding of the classification of animals and familiarity with the properties of many types of semi-sentient creatures.

**Bureaucracy:** An understanding of how to deal with governments, particularly the Administratum, and their many and varied departments, forms and policies.

**Chymistry:** A knowledge of chemicals and elements, their alchemical applications, and their use throughout the Imperium.

**Cryptology:** An understanding of codes, ciphers, secret languages and numerical keys. This may be used to either crack a code, or create one.

**Heraldry:** A grasp of the principles of heraldry, as well as a knowledge of the most common liveries, seals and heraldic devices used in the Imperium.

**Imperial Creed**: An understanding of the rituals of the Ecclesiarchy, the construction of their temples and the finer points of liturgy. May be used to conduct rituals for others.

**Judgement:** Knowledge of the proper punishments for the myriad of crimes and heresies punishable by Imperial law.

**Legend:** A knowledge of the great histories of old, such as the terrible Horus Heresy and the Dark Age of Technology.

**Numerology:** An understanding of the mysterious properties of numbers, from Catastrophe theory to the Sadleirian litany.

**Occult:** An understanding of occult ritual, theories and superstitions, as well as the better known mystical uses of occult items.

**Philosophy:** A knowledge of the theories of thought, belief and criticism. May be used for debate and for creating philosophical works.

**Tactica Imperialis:** A grounding in the Tactica Imperialis, as well as other theories of war, troop deployment and battle techniques. May be used to plan a battle or deduce the likely flow of war.
##### **Practical Knowledge** 
Whilst Scholastic Lore mainly concerns the theoretical and academic, those with true wisdom know it is often applicable to more practical pursuits too. You may make a Scholastic Lore Test to gain a +10 bonus to a related Skill Test, or to assist another Acolyte using a related Skill. However, such scholarly insight is not recalled hurriedly, often requiring a review of reference materials, some on the spot conjecture, and possibly a good cup of recaf. Both Tests are made at once, and the related Skill Test increases in time from Rounds to minutes, minutes to hours, and hours to days. If the time taken is already in days, then this is increased by a further 1d10 days. Use the following table to determine which Scholastic Lore is related to a given skill:

| Scholastic Lore     |     Related Skill(s)      |
| ------------------- | :-----------------------: |
| Astromancy          |        Navigation         |
| Beasts              |    Survival, Wrangling    |
| Chymistry           |         Chem-Use          |
| Cryptology          |          Cipher           |
| Imperial Creed      |        Invocation         |
| Judgement           | Intimidate, Interrogation |
| Numerology          |  Barter, Evaluate, Logic  |
| Occult              |        Invocation         |
| Tactical Imperialis |          Command          |

## **Scrutiny 
(Basic) 
Perception**

Whilst some would argue that an Inquisitor’s default frame of mind is to be suspicious, those Acolytes with the Scrutiny skill are better able to judge when a suspect genuinely warrants that suspicion.

Use the Scrutiny skill to make assessments about people you encounter, to determine if someone is lying to you, to sense ulterior motives and generally appraise the worth of another being. When trying to perceive a falsehood, or some other form of deception, you make an Opposed Test, pitting your Scrutiny against the target's Deceive. If you beat your opponent by achieving more degrees of success, you get a hunch that something is not right.

Note that Scrutiny does not confer telepathy and cannot be used to reveal all the secrets about a target. Rather, this Skill serves to counteract attempts to manipulate you through Interaction skills such as Charm, Deceive and Intimidate.

The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Empathy:** A successful Scrutiny Test allows you to discern a target’s disposition. This Test is Opposed by the target’s Deceive Test if he has something to hide.

**Lying:** You may use your knowledge of deception to help make your own lies all the more difficult to detect. If you first make a successful Scrutiny Test you gain a +10 bonus to a subsequent Deceive Test.
## **Search 
(Basic) 
Perception**

Search is a useful Skill for Acolytes conducting investigations, helping turn up valuable clues or hidden evidence. Search differs from Awareness in that it involves a great deal of exploration, turning over items, opening doors and letting your instincts guide you as you toss a room.

Use the Search skill whenever you want to examine an area for concealed objects, clues and anything else that might be hidden. Search differs from Awareness in that you Test Awareness passively, Testing whenever some hidden danger might appear or to notice a small detail as you move past it. Search, on the other hand, represents an active effort to check an area.

A single Search Test is sufficient to cover a small room or area. When an object or individual is deliberately hidden, a Search Test is resolved as an Opposed Test, pitting your Search Test against your target's Concealment Test.

A Search Test takes a minimum of five minutes, dependent on the area being examined. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Lengthy Searches:** If you're fortunate enough to have time to burn you may opt to take longer over a search, meticulously going over every square metre to find what you are looking for. For every additional five minutes you spend searching an area, you gain a +10 bonus on your Search Test (to a maximum of +30).

**Searching for Clues:** Search cannot be used as an Investigation Skill in its own right, but it can be used to assist an Investigation Skill. When investigating a crime scene, you may make a Search Test to attempt to notice any clues. Every degree of success reduces the Difficulty of a subsequent Investigation Test by one-step.
## **Secret Tongue 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Acolyte, Administratum, Ecclesiarchy, Gutter, Military, Tech. Other secret tongues may be available at the GM's discretion.

Secret Tongue is used to speak and comprehend a particularly obscure and arcane language known to only those of a specific profession, organisation or class. Secret tongues are more like codes than real languages. By the use of signifiers, body language, and code words, users can speak in one tongue but use a secret language to impart deeper meaning or to relay a lot of information quickly. Under normal circumstances, Skill Tests are unnecessary if all speakers know the secret language. They may be required in adverse conditions such as communicating in a noisy venue, or during the chaos of battle. 

Although much of the meaning of a secret tongue requires body language and verbal intonations, it can be conveyed as part of a crude cipher. You may make a **Difficult (–10) Secret Tongue Test** instead of a Cipher Test. Alternatively, if you first make a Secret Tongue Test you gain +10 to a subsequent related Cipher Test, representing the multiple layers of meaning and code hidden within the message. Both you and the person you are ciphering to must possess the same Secret Tongue Skill Group to benefit from this usage.

Some more noteworthy Secret Tongue Skill Groups are described as follows:

**Acolyte:** A pre-arranged series of code phrases and inflections intelligible only to a fellow cell member. Note that each cell of Acolytes has a unique version of this language.

**Administratum:** A collection of acronyms, jargon and procedural formalities used by the Administratum. Note that this is an exceedingly loquacious language.

**Ecclesiarchy:** An allegorical language of devotion and politics, full of strange metaphors and specialised High Gothic expressions and idioms.

**Gutter:** A pidgin version of Low Gothic spoken by the lowest levels of Imperial society, incorporating a mishmash of colourful slang terms.

**Military:** A selection of coded phrases, jargon, references to ancient battles and a surprising number of terms for death.

**Tech:** The Lingua Technis of the Adeptus Mechanicus, comprising of jargon, binary and in some cases low or high frequency sound waves.

A Secret Tongue Test is usually a Free Action.
## **Security 
(Advanced) 
Agility**

Many an Acolyte has saved himself the indignity of breaking down a door with judicious use of the Security skill. Security is used to bypass locks of all types and circumvent tough security systems to get into well-protected locations. You can also use Security to take control of mechanised or logis-controlled security systems so they work for you instead of the original owner.

You can use the Security skill to bypass locks and other security systems. The Difficulty of the Test depends on the quality of the defence. Generally one Test is sufficient, but more complicated systems may require additional Tests or degrees of success. 

Using this Skill without proper tools or equipment is extremely challenging. If you lack a multikey, or at least basic lockpicks for simple mechanical locks, you suffer a -20 penalty to any Tests made to open them.

A Security Test takes one minute, with each degree of success reducing this time by ten seconds. Note that very large, intricate, or complex systems may require Extended Tests. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Hiding from Sensors:** Sometimes it won’t be a person looking for you, but a sensor, such as an auspex. Unless the sensor relies on physical input, the Concealment skill is of no use. Instead you may use the Security skill in place of Concealment, although you must have access to a suitable tool or piece of tech to disrupt or deceive the sensor.

**Security Rigging:** You can make a Security Test to set up and install a security system. Each degree of success increases the difficulty of any Test made to breach it by one. A Security Test to setup a security device takes one hour.

**Security Surveillance:** When using handheld scanners or larger security monitors, you may use Security instead of Awareness to detect hidden threats or creatures. This use relies more on interpreting the device's datastream outputs than on any audio or visual cues being presented to identify your quarry.
## **Shadowing 
(Advanced) 
Agility**

Whether stalking a dangerous heretic through a packed market or following a contact through the deserted streets of a spaceport, Shadowing is useful for avoiding getting spotted whilst tailing your mark. Shadowing differs from Concealment in that the latter involves hunkering down and hiding in one place, while the former is all about skulking and sneaking, creeping along while staying out of sight from your prey.

The Shadowing skill allows you to follow another creature or vehicle without being seen. Whilst Concealment is a largely static skill, Shadowing often has you slipping from one place of cover to another or, if that is not possible, acting as if you are doing something else, such as reading through a data-slate, scrutinising a wanted poster, or anything else that makes you blend in with your environment in a non-threatening manner. A Shadowing Test is always an Opposed Test, pitting your Skill against your opponent's Awareness skill (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill).

Shadowing becomes far easier in certain environments. When threading through a dense crowd, or following along in a foggy night, you gain a bonus on your Test. Each factor that masks your presence confers a +10 bonus to a maximum of +30 for three factors. For example, you would get a+20 bonus when Shadowing a target at night through a crowded bazaar.

You may also use Shadowing in a more “defensive“ capacity to evade a pursuer, rather than being a pursuer yourself. Once you are aware that you're being followed, you may make a Shadowing Test Opposed by your opponent’s Awareness Test. If you beat your opponent a number of times equal to his Intelligence Bonus, you manage to slip away unseen, likely confounding your pursuers.

A single Shadowing Test is sufficient to follow your opponent unseen for one minute.
## **Silent Move 
(Basic) 
Agility**

The Inquisition carries out much of its work in the shadows, going about its investigations under the noses of the heretical and dangerous. An Acolyte who has the ability to move about unnoticed, entering suspects’ houses without them realising, is a highly useful asset.

Use the Silent Move skill whenever you want to creep about without making a noise. The Difficulty depends on the surface on which you walk—broken glass, twigs, gravel and so on, can all make extra noise. A Silent Move Test is always an Opposed Test, pitting your Skill against your opponent's Awareness skill (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill).

A Silent Move Test is usually a Free Action made as part of a Move Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Ambush:** You can attempt to skulk up on your opponent and ambush him. So long as you are not in combat and have not yet been noticed, you may make a Silent Move Test Opposed by your opponent’s Awareness Test. If you are successful, you quietly move on up on your opponent as though you had successfully Feinted in combat, and so long as your next Action is a Standard Attack, it cannot be Dodged or Parried. If your next Action is anything other than a Standard Attack then this advantage is lost.

**Sneak:** You can make yourself practically invisible when Shadowing an opponent. If you first succeed with a Silent Move Test, you gain a +10 bonus on your Shadowing Test.
## **Sleight of Hand 
(Advanced) 
Agility**

Although derided as common street subterfuge, Sleight of Hand has many practical applications for the Acolyte, ranging from the ability to palm a small but useful object at a crime scene, to slipping your Inquisitorial rosette away when apprehended by heretics, or even pulling a pistol from a concealed holster unseen by your enemies.

The Sleight of Hand skill is used to palm objects, pick pockets or perform tricks with small items like coins and cards. The smaller the object, the easier it is to pick up, which is reflected in the task's Difficulty as set by the GM. In most cases, a Sleight of Hand Test is an Opposed Test, pitting your Skill against your opponent's Awareness skill (or half their Perception if they do not have the Awareness skill). 

You may opt to use Sleight of Hand ahead of a Gamble Test to hide cards up your sleeve or palm dice. Success gives you a +20 bonus to your Gamble Test. However, failing by five or more degrees indicates that your ruse is revealed with predictably unpleasant consequences.

You may make a Sleight of Hand Test to dazzle audiences with tricks of the hand with cards, marbles, or another prop you happen to have. Unlike Blather, those witnessing your Sleight of Hand are still able to act—however, any allies nearby who can take advantage of the distraction may benefit from your successful Test as if you were assisting them (for example, skulking by in the background using Silent Move).

Sleight of Hand is usually a Half Action. You may make a Sleight of Hand Test as a Free Action, but you worsen the Difficulty by –10.
## **Speak Language 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

**Skill Group:** Eldar, High Gothic, Hive Dialect, Low Gothic, Ork, Ship Dialect, Techna-Lingua, Tribal Dialect. Other languages may be available at the GM's discretion.

Knowledge of a variety of languages can broaden your ability to deal with the indigenous peoples (or creatures...) of the worlds you explore, allowing you to communicate easily without having to resort to pantomime or risking a potentially disastrous error in translation.

The Speak Language skill is used to communicate with others using a common tongue. The Gothic tongue—formally, Low Gothic—is the official language of the Imperium, and can be heard on all of its many diverse worlds. However, each world likely has its own local dialects and peculiarities, and many may even possess their own unique language as well. Under normal circumstances, Tests are unnecessary if all speakers know the language. 

You can make a Speak Language Test to improvise a crude cipher, a sort of pidgin tongue intended to convey a coded message. If successful, you manage to make a message that makes sense; the recipient must then succeed on a Speak Language Test, or an **Ordinary (+10) Logic** or **Scholastic Lore (Crypography) Test** to translate it. If either party fails, the message comes across as nonsense or is otherwise indecipherable.

A sample of some more widespread languages are described as follows:

**Eldar:** Though no human can hope to capture all the subtle nuances and sub-tones of this staggeringly complex and ancient xeno-speak, possessing this Skill Group is enough to make one's meaning clear when negotiating with such eldritch beings.

**High Gothic**: The official language of the Imperium, this refined speech is used in the most formal situations, matters of Imperial law and political edicts, and forms the main of Ecclesiastical liturgy.

**Hive Dialect**: A slang-riddled and debased form of Low Gothic unique to a given hive—those unfamiliar with the local dialect can still get by, but may miss out on key context or commit various social blunders.

**Low Gothic**: Also known simply as Gothic, this is the common tongue of the Imperium. A simplified vernacular with less arcane syntax and grammatical structure, Low Gothic is spoken by nearly all of the God-Emperor's innumerable billions of subjects.

**Ork:** A hideously mangled form of Low Gothic, with mutilated pronunciations, uniformly terrible grammar, and plenty of 'Orky' words mixed in. Their rudimentary written 'language', composed of runes and glyphs, is also covered by this Skill Group.

**Ship Dialect**: Code-speak, jargon and idioms unique to a given vessel. Among voidborn crew members, this manner of speaking might be far more prevalent than Gothic, and could be entirely incomprehensible to so-called “flatlanders“. 

**Techna-Lingua:** Unique to the Adeptus Mechanicus, this is a binary language that has been optimised for rapid communication of technical data and servitor commands. To non-speakers, it simply sounds like brief, rapid bursts of ear-grating auditory machine code.

**Tribal Dialect**: The indigenous tongue spoken by natives of a particular planet where Gothic has not yet taken hold. This could be a rough and primitive language, or a very sophisticated and phonetically complex dialect, depending on the world's relative level of advancement.

A Speak Language Test is usually a Free Action.
### **Communicating Without Language**

In a place as vast as the Imperium, player characters may find themselves encountering xenos or abhumans that are not enlightened by the glory of the God-Emperor and are ignorant of the favoured tongue. Whilst many Acolytes may be inclined to purge these benighted beings as a matter of principle, there may be times when communication is necessary and even prudent. In these cases, a character must use pantomime to get his point across. To do so, the character must make a Fellowship Test and the target must make an Intelligence Test. Obviously, phrases such as "he's behind you" are relatively easy to deliver, whilst more complicated comments might be very difficult, or even impossible to get across. Each degree of success on the Fellowship Test grants the target a +10 bonus to its Intelligence Test to figure out what the character is saying. A failed Fellowship Test indicates that the message is incomprehensible. Should the character being spoken to fail their Intelligence Test the wrong message comes across, which may result in unfortunate consequences.

Even if you are not familiar with a particular language or dialect, you may make a **Hard (–20) Speak Language Test** to attempt to understand a sense of the meaning or intent. If you speak a related language or dialect (such as High Gothic to Low Gothic, Hive Dialect to Low Gothic, and so on) the Difficulty decreases to **Difficult (–10)**.
## **Survival 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence

Whether lying in wait for Nurgle cultists in the foetid jungle of a death world or searching for shelter from a sandstorm on a desert planet, the Survival skill can be a lifesaver.

You use the Survival skill to subsist in the wild. This Skill encompasses such activities as fishing, game hunting, making fires, finding edible food, constructing improvised shelters, finding safe resting places, and so on. The Difficulty of the Test depends on the environment, with death worlds being much more difficult to survive on than an agri-world.

Failing a Survival Test usually indicates that you have failed to find what you are looking for, either because you are inept or because it is simply not there to be found. Failing by five or more degrees indicates that you fail spectacularly, usually by bringing trouble down on your head—perhaps by triggering a rockslide, or stirring up a den of angry silt-bears or foolishly consuming poisonous berries.

A Survival Test takes one hour, with each degree of success reducing this time by ten minutes. Under certain circumstances, like trying to find a crude shelter from a meteor storm, the Difficulty can be increased and the time taken reduced to one minute. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Hunting:** You may use the Survival skill in place of Tracking when hunting for animals in the wild. The Difficulty, however, worsens by one-step. It may not be used in urban areas or to track humanoid prey, although some more bestial xenos could be pursued in this fashion.

**Snares:** You can use the Survival skill to construct simple snares and traps to catch animals and other prey. To set the trap, you must succeed on Survival Test. The base Difficulty is **Ordinary (+10)**,
but you may increase the Difficulty in order to make it harder to disable or escape the snare.
A typical snare triggers by location, meaning that the target steps into the area and is affected by the trap. Snares affect just one target at a time and can be made large enough to ensnare a man-sized creature. Once sprung, the trap must be manually reset to work again.
An intelligent creature may notice the trap before springing it by succeeding on an Awareness or Search Test. The Difficulty of this Test is **Routine (+20)**, but if you also succeed on a Concealment Test, you can increase the Difficulty by one-step plus one-step for each degree of success. You may not retry the Concealment Test when constructing the snare.
If the target locates the snare, it can either go around it or attempt to neutralise it. In the case of the latter, the target must succeed on a Survival Test against the same Difficulty made to set the snare. On a success, the snare is dismantled.
Should the target spring the trap, it may make an Agility Test against the same Difficulty you faced to set the trap. On a success, the creature avoids the snare. On a failure, it is firmly caught and held until released. A caught creature can attempt a Contortionist Test once each hour to escape. Again, the Difficulty is the same as the one you beat to set the snare in the first place.
## **Swim 
(Basic, Movement) 
Strength**

The Swim skill is used to swim and dive in bodies of water. You don't need to make a Swim Test under ideal circumstances, but hazardous conditions such as rough waters, hands being tied, or swimming whilst fighting all require Swim Tests to move. To swim under hazardous conditions, you must make a Swim Test as a Move Action. A success indicates that you move in any direction up to a number of metres equal to one-half your Strength Bonus, or simply tread water at your option. A failed Test means that you make no progress and cannot move. If you fail by 2 degrees or more, you sink one metre for every 20kg of your weight.

Characters that are unable to swim for some reason (unconsciousness, paralysis etc.) automatically sink one metre of depth for each 20kg of their weight on their Turn. Theoretically, a character could sink all the way to the bottom and walk their way out of the water if they can hold their breath long enough.

The Swim skill assumes a character is attempting to swim in water, but on alien worlds a character might encounter unusual substances such as lakes of sulphuric acid. The Difficulty of the Test might be increased to represent particular conditions. Swim does not protect a character from harm when swimming in toxic or otherwise dangerous liquids, nor does it negate the need for protective clothing.

A Swim test is a Free Action made as part of a Move Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Aquatic Combat:** Whenever you fight while submerged in water, Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests with most weapons take a –20 penalty. As well, you must succeed on a Swim Test to move in this environment. When you Test your Swim skill, and you get two or more degrees of success, you reduce the penalty to your attack Tests to –10. Note that some weapons especially suitable for use underwater, such as spears, may impose a smaller penalty, or none at all.

**Hiding Underwater:** You can hide from a pursuer on land by diving into a sufficiently deep or murky body of water and waiting below the surface until they have passed by. If you do this you may use your Swim skill instead of Concealment.

**Life-Saving:** When another character gets into trouble in the water, you can dive in to help him out. If you reach the struggling character, you can pull him to safety by succeeding on a Swim Test, but the Difficulty worsens by one-step for the added bulk.
## **Tech-Use 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

Gear and equipment in the 41st Millennium is tricky and confounding to use, the machine-spirits unruly and restless. Tech-Use allows you to placate these entities and make them more cooperative when working with technological devices of all kinds.

Using a basic piece of equipment under typical circumstances requires no Test—for example, tracking a target with an auspex or opening a power-actuated shuttle hatch. Tech-Use Tests are necessary for highly complex, unusual or unfamiliar gear, malfunctioning or broken items, and any situation where conditions are less than ideal, such as attempting to use the same auspex near a plasma core or coaxing the machine spirit of a strange vessel’s warp drive to reignite its fires.

You may use Tech-Use to perform minor repairs on damaged or defective items, such as replacing burnt out tubes in a vox-caster, using an Extended Test of Duration and Difficulty set by the GM depending on the item’s complexity and the extent of the damage. Tech-Use does not include building an item from scratch or performing complex repairs on badly damaged pieces of gear, which requires use of a relevant Trade Skill.

A Tech-Use Test to figure out how an item works usually takes one minute, but might take less or more time depending on the complexity. Specific gear items that require a Tech-Use Test to operate will indicate how long the Test takes in their individual descriptions. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Cyber Wrangling:** You may use your Tech-Use instead of Wrangling, but only when dealing with machines designed to look and act like beasts, such as a cyber-mastiff or grapplehawk.

**Technical Support:** When another character’s Skill Test involves a piece of technological equipment, you may assist them using your Tech-Use skill, even if they are using a different Skill to use the gear in question.
###### Example: 
*Mattheus struggles with the controls of the Inquisitor’s guncutter during a rough landing and must make a Pilot Test to bring the powerful flyer down safely. His cohort Ruthe does not have the Pilot skill, and normally could not assist, but because he is sitting in the co-pilot's seat and has access to the guncutter's systems, he may assist using his Tech-Use skill instead. However, if Ruthe had been stuck in the vessel's cargo hold, he likely would not have been able to use Tech-Use in this fashion, even if he could use the guncutter's intercom to speak with Mattheus and offer advise.*
## **Tracking 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence**

Tracking can be a handy skill to have in a wide variety of situations, whether chasing an escaped cultist through the sewers, working out the number of intruders at a crime scene, or hunting a wild beast in the wilderness.

With the Tracking Skill you may follow the signs left by your quarry. Following obvious tracks does not require a Skill Test and is considered part of your normal movement. In instances where the passage of time, elemental weathering, or deliberate subterfuge have eroded the signs, or where the very environment makes seeing them difficult, such as darkness or fog, Tracking Tests are required. The Difficulty depends on the condition of the traces and the tracker’s surroundings—recent snowfall could make tracking prints a **Difficult (–10) Test**, while those same tracks being a week old could be **Hard (–20)** or worse. When following any tracks where the Difficulty of the Test is more than **Challenging (+0)**, the tracker’s Movement rate drops to half.

A cunning, naturally evasive, or just devious quarry may attempt to conceal or erase its tracks. In any case where an opponent has attempted to do this, make an Opposed Test made against the prey’s Concealment.

A Tracking Test is a Free Action made as part of a Move Action. The following special rules are associated with this skill:

**Escaping Pursuit:** Whilst the most straightforward way of concealing tracks from a pursuer is to hide them using the Concealment skill, as a skilled tracker, you have several more tricks up your sleeve, such as backtracking by using your own tracks or disguising your tracks to resemble those of a beast. You can make a Tracking Test to conceal your tracks instead of Concealment.

**Tracking Suspects:** You may use the Tracking skill as an Investigation Skill in situations where it is important to work out who or what has been present at a site, when they were there and how many were there, as well as working out where they went next.
## **Trade 
(Advanced, Crafting) 
Various**

**Skill Group:** Archaeologist (Int), Agri (S), Apothecary (Int), Armourer (S), Artist (Ag), Cartographer (Ag), Cook (Int), Copyist (Int), Embalmer (Int), Linguist (Int), Mason (Ag), Merchant (Fel), Miner (S), Prospector (S), Scrimshawer (Ag), Shipwright (Int), Smith (S), Soothsayer (Fel), Tanner (S), Technomat (Int), Valet (Fel), and Wright (Int). Others may be available at the GM's discretion.

Many of an Inquisitor's more handy Acolytes possess exceptional technical skills, either acquired before their service to the Inquisition or picked up during their employment there. Trade skills represent the most varied and versatile application of an Acolyte's training and resourcefulness. Having a Trade skill indicates that you know how to practice a trade or craft. With this Skill, you can make a comfortable living (when not serving your Inquisitorial masters) or create items suited to your trade. You can also make a Trade Test to identify the handiwork of a particular craftsman, or to know something about a particular item.

A Trade Test normally represents a day's hard work. A Trade Test made to identify an item or craftsman is usually a Full Action, during which time the tradesman sucks his teeth and sighs before making his prognosis.

An Acolyte with Trade skills is considered to be a member of the Trading Class for the purposes of determining monthly income, although particularly gruelling investigations (or a fastidious taskmaster for an Inquisitor) might not allow an Acolyte enough free time to practice their trade in a given month.

Some more common Trades an Acolyte may encounter or have the chance to learn themselves are as follows:
#### Trade (Archaeologist)
**(Advanced)**
**Intelligence**

The Imperium is a vast and ancient regime with a history spanning many millennia. Over time, the structures and other trappings of civilisation become abandoned and decay into the environment, or are literally built on top of as the inexorable progress of mankind's dominion of the galaxy marches on. A trained archaeologist knows that there can be great value in studying the relics of the past, both in terms of esoteric knowledge and material profit.

Unlike most Trade skills, you use your training in archaeology to improve other Crafting and Investigation skills when used with antique or archaic objects and their related fields of study. Successful use of this Skill grants a +10 bonus on any Crafting or Investigation Skill Tests made against the relic in question, with each degree of success granting an additional +10 bonus (to a maximum of +30).
##### Example:
*Argenta, a trained archaeologist, is summoned to examine an unusual device found deep within the bowels of a drifting space hulk. As the device appears to be quite old, Argenta may make a Trade (Archaeologist) Test to get a better frame of study over exactly what it is she's dealing with. Argenta succeeds with one degree of success, gaining a +20 bonus to her following Tech-Use Test to divine the device's functions. It turns out the device is an archeotech conversion beam weapon predating the Great Crusade—quite a singular find! 
Some time later, Argenta is cataloguing the piecemeal ruins of a pre-Imperial civilisation on a distant frontier world. Believing the ruins to be originally much larger than they appear now, Argenta makes a Trade (Archaeologist) Test, gaining a +10 bonus on her subsequent Trade (Cartographer) Test to intuit the ruined city's appearance and street plan in its heyday.*

#### Trade (Agri)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Strength**

While most Acolytes probably haven't considered the notion of settling down to become a humble agriworker, there may be instances where this Skill comes into play during the campaign, whether to start an ornamental garden in your quarters as a hobby or to cultivate a rare xenos flower essential to the treatment of an uncommon disease. This Skill can also be used for the identification and classification of unknown plants.

When using this Skill to grow a crop, be it medicinal, ornamental or foodstuff, the end Craftsmanship of the task determines the quality of the harvest.

**Poor:** The plant yields only half of the expected result, or the potency is only half that foreseen.
**Common:** The growth of the plants is average or as anticipated.
**Good:** Careful tending has produced plants with 150% of the results of a normal crop, either in quantity or influence.
**Best:** Attentive cultivation results in plants with twice the properties or yield of the standard variety.

#### Trade (Apothecary)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Intelligence**

As a capable apothecary, you can do far more than just hand out anti-tox pills. You can develop new compounds from medicinal plants or chemicals and warn against the dangerous side
effects of drug combinations. Your skills enable you to oversee the long-term reactions resultant from the most beneficial or destructive substances in the Imperium. You can recreate substances when provided a small sample and the proper equipment, and can determine new uses for existing substances by combining them in new ways. For example, you may be able to determine that combining spook and obscura in certain proportions actually creates a mind-warping hallucinogen—or a deadly poison.

While the Chem-Use skill covers the typical use and simple manufacture of toxins, poisons and drugs, the Trade (Apothecary) skill allows you to formulate more advanced compounds, identify particularly complex mixtures and anticipate the interaction between different medicines or toxins, particularly ones requiring substantial time to develop.

This Skill can also be used to recall the origin, derivation or manufacture of even complex or obscure substances, such as remembering that the primary ingredient of slaught can be created from glands found in soldier-hornets. The result of the roll determines the amount of information revealed according to Table: Trade Skill Lore (see above).

Of course, you must first obtain all the necessary ingredients, components and equipment before attempting to create a compound. Acquiring the proper substances for specialised or restricted formulae may be quite difficult or illegal, or form the basis of an entire adventure.
#### Trade (Armourer)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Strength**

The Trade (Armourer) skill is used to create, modify or repair arms and armour, from simple tasks such as adding a fire selector to a bolt pistol to the complex design of combi-weapons and artificer armour. This Skill deals with personal weapons and protection rather than vehicular or large-scale systems, which are covered by the Trade (Shipwright) skill for void ships and Trade (Wright) for everything else.

One of the most commonly used Skills and potentially most useful in everyday application, Trade (Armourer) grants you unparalleled creativity in customising your kit. Keep in mind, however, that some technologies are simply beyond the capabilities of all but the most learned of the Adeptus Mechanicus. No Acolyte, however skilled, could create or repair weaponry from the Dark Age of Technology, and certain weapons of xenos origin could be out of the question as well. As usual, the GM should be the final judge in such matters.

You will still find a bewildering number of possibilities available for the alteration and upgrading of weapons and armour, from creating adamantine blades (without the Primitive attribute) to customising armour for its wearer (giving it the perks of Good Craftsmanship due to its exceptional fitment). Simple upgrades, such as those found in the *Macharian Handbook*, only require a simple Skill Test, but the creation of a more elaborate modification of armaments uses the Crafting rules. While by no means an exhaustive list, Table: Armourer Test Difficulty serves as a guideline for determining Crafting Difficulty.

In addition, you may use this Skill to identify the forge world, manufacturer, or possibly even the artisan who created the device, depending on the degrees of success on the Skill Test. If you have found a weapon used to murder a local Imperial official, it may be useful to know that it is Stygies VII-Pattern and engraved by the renowned master armourer Weland Tudela.

##### Table: Armourer Test Difficulty

| Difficulty       | Example                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple (+40)     | Engraving an aquila or monogram onto a weapon or armour               |
| Easy (+30)       | Repairing cosmetic damage; attaching a sight to a gun with a mount    |
| Routine (+20)    | Adding a fire selector or attaching a sight to a gun without a mount  |
| Ordinary (+10)   | Adapting parts from one weapon to another; minor repairs to weapons   |
| Challenging (+0) | Converting a weapon to a compact version; adding unusual upgrades     |
| Difficult (–10)  | Repairing damaged armour; major repairs to weapons                    |
| Hard (–20)       | Assembling a combi-weapon; adding reinforcement to armour             |
| Very Hard (–30)  | Crafting power weapons; removing the Unreliable quality from a weapon |
#### Trade (Artist)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Agility or Intelligence**

An artist can produce objects or experiences of profound beauty or emotion, inspiring the senses, mind and spirit. The Performer Skill Group covers the execution of many art forms—dance, recital or storytelling—but Trade (Artist) deals with the creation of the material performed—the poem, play or song. The Skill also covers the composition of physical art: sculpture, paintings and hololiths.

Agility is the default characteristic for the Trade (artist) skill, but GMs may optionally allow the player to use Intelligence for the creation of more scholarly works, such as plays, music,
poems and novels.

This Skill also gives the Acolyte the ability to observe works of art and potentially recall information about the school or style of the piece, and possibly even the name of the artist.

The Craftsmanship of a piece of art can make its performance easier or harder. A play or poem of Poor Craftsmanship would impose a –10 penalty to its performance. A song of Good Craftsmanship would impart a +10 bonus to the Test of the performer, and a tale of Best Craftsmanship grants a +20 bonus to its presentation. These bonuses also apply to the **Charming Performance** and **Enthralling Performance** special rules. 

Art can affect the mood of those observing it in many ways, including inspiration, sadness, anger and others. If the artist wants his work to affect the audience in a particular way, this should be defined in Step One: Defining the Task of the Crafting rules. The GM assigns a different Difficulty to creating a mural that inspires a positive reaction to the Adeptus Mechanicus than one without additional effects. Keep in mind, however, that these are modest effects. While the viewer may feel inspired by the art, it will not cause him to change or act against firmly held beliefs.

The creation of an inspirational art piece is **Hard (–20)** for concepts coinciding with local culture, such as veneration of the God-Emperor within the Imperium, but is **Very Hard (–30)** for anything that significantly goes against such conventions, such as fostering a more positive reaction to xenos when viewed in the Imperium.


#### Trade (Cartographer)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Agility**

You can produce maps and charts of high quality from information gathered first hand or by others. The Craftsmanship of these documents can affect the Navigation (Surface) Tests of those using them. Likewise, you are able to read maps made by others more easily, obtaining hidden or obscure information left by other cartographers.

The cartographer must use observation or research to gain adequate information to create a map. The GM should keep this in mind when assigning the duration of a task, as large maps require lengthy examination and groundwork. The Heightened Senses (Vision) Talent can reduce the Difficulty of the task by one level if gathering data personally, so the Difficulty of creating a map of a labyrinthine Ecclesiarchy cathedral would be reduced from Difficult (–10) to Challenging (+0).

When creating maps from research, existing sources or second-hand information, the final Craftsmanship of the map can be no greater than that of the source material, no matter how good your rolls during the Crafting process.

Note that this Trade Skill can only be used to create maps suitable for terrestrial navigation. Star charts, the astromantic maps used to plot courses for voidships in the warp, are largely confined to the purview of the Navis Nobilite, and would be far beyond the means of a common Acolyte.

#### Trade (Cook)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Intelligence**

An Acolyte with this Skill can create meals not only pleasing to the palate, but also ones of desired nutritional content—or lack thereof. The results of this Skill can also be combined with Carouse, Chem-Use or Trade (Apothecary) in making drinks or medicines that taste better, or the creation of foods that mask certain flavours from those ingesting them. The GM should set the Difficulty of the task in accordance with the traits desired. Creating a simple but nutritious meal for fellow Acolytes might be Ordinary (+10); cooking a dish to mask a bland-tasting drug for a noble’s entourage would be Difficult (–10); or devising a meal nutritious for a xenos creature could be Very Hard (–30) or worse.

Acolytes can also use this Skill to determine the ingredients or origins of foods they consume, or notice out of the ordinary tastes, using Table: Trade Skill Lore. They can also make an Opposed Skill Test against the subject’s Perception to either hide or reveal hidden substances within a dish or drink.

Meals or drinks of exceptional quality can affect Blather or Charm Tests. Refreshments of Poor Craftsmanship result in a penalty of –10 to these Tests, but a banquet of Good quality gives a +10 bonus and those of Best Craftsmanship grant a +20 bonus.

#### Trade (Copyist)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Intelligence**

Copyists in the 41st Millennium are far more than mindless scribes scratching out data sheets with an electro-quill. Though certainly capable of this task, an Acolyte with the Copyist skill creates illuminated manuscripts of great beauty, containing anything from family histories to epic ballads. A talented copyist is of immediate interest to an Inquisitor—aside from being able to draw up pleasing formal reports at the end of an investigation, this skill is also used to create forgeries, which can be a vital tool in cracking open the operations of a heretical cult.

In addition to penning words, copyists can create ink and other writing implements, including pigments that can only be read in certain types of light, ones that disappear after a specific period of time, or types capable of marking or etching pages of metal, ceramic or hide. Pigments of this variety allow for very advanced codes and provide a +10 bonus to Cipher Tests when using written materials. Each Trade (Copyist) Skill Mastery confers an additional bonus equal to the level of mastery.

Copyists can also create paper—as well as other writing mediums—and bindings. Pages can consist of sources as exotic as woven metal or alien animal hide, but could also be as simple as compressed plant fibre.
#### Trade (Embalmer)
**(Advanced, Crafting, Investigation)**
**Intelligence**

An Acolyte with the Trade (Embalmer) skill can preserve the deceased, as well as almost any organic material, animal or plant, though some things require more elaborate treatments and substances than others. This Skill also allows you to reconstruct recently dead plants, animals or persons into a semblance of their unblemished living appearance. The process often requires chemicals and fluids with noxious odours, resulting in a somewhat negative public opinion of this otherwise-vital trade.

Whilst respectfully attending to the dead is a good and noble profession, the reconstructive aspects of this Skill can also be of great use in an investigation. With access to physical remains, a trained embalmer could develop significant insight into the appearance the deceased had in life. The Difficulty for this Test depends on the condition of the remains—determining the face of a recently disfigured murder victim would be fairly straightforward, while recreating the appearance and thus identity of a decomposed or skeletal body could be quite an endeavour, especially if there are a lot of missing parts. As a general rule of thumb, a successful Trade (Embalmer) Test reveals basic information about the body in question, with additional degrees of success revealing greater details. Three or more degrees of success is sufficient to reconstruct the appearance of the deceased entirely.

#### Trade (Linguist)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Intelligence**

While the God-Emperor's subjects are officially united in the Gothic language, the fact of the matter is there are a dizzying range of tongues and dialects that exist across the breadth of the Imperium—to say nothing of the foul speaking mannerisms of the xeno and the mutant. Linguists are trained in the academic study of language and communication, able to assist in active translation between those with no common tongue. Furthermore, a linguist is capable of drafting manuals and guides to help contain this information in a portable form—handy for off-world traders or Imperial Guard officers deploying to a planet where the Gothic tongue is not widespread. A trained linguist might be a more common member of a Rogue Trader's retinue, but could be equally valuable to the employ of a planet-hopping Inquisitor, especially if they happen to serve under the Ordo Xenos.

You may use the Trade (Linguist) Skill to improve your ability to translate other languages. With success, you gain a +10 bonus on any Speak Language Skill Tests made to comport different languages at once, with each degree of success granting an additional +10 bonus (to a maximum of +30). 

Alternatively, this Skill can be used to create instructional media to assist others in communicating in another language that they don't speak themselves. If you have the relevant Speak Language Skill yourself, you may use the Crafting rules to draw up a handbook for others to aid them in their linguistic deficiency. The utility of your manual depends on its Craftsmanship. A manual of Poor Craftsmanship isn't sufficient to actually speak the language, but does provide a +10 bonus to Fellowship Tests made to pantomime to the other party. A Common Craftsmanship manual provides a +10 bonus to Speak Language Tests when attempting to communicate in a language the reader does not possess, while a Good Craftsmanship manual increases the bonus to +20. A Best Craftsmanship manual is a true treasure—the reader may use the manual to speak the language in question without actually having the relevant Speak Language Skill, although the pace of speaking is quite slow as the reader must continually reference the manual each time the conversation advances.

#### Trade (Mason)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Agility**

Masons erect structures, monuments, walls and fortifications out of stone blocks, mortar or cement. Depending on the desired result, materials may include cobblestone, granite, ouslite, marble or any of a number of materials. This Skill also covers the use of rockcrete, a ubiquitous building material for Imperial structures and fortifications where speed of construction outweighs artistic concerns, and various reinforcements to stonework with iron or plasteel.

Given the scale of most masonry projects and the gross weight of the materials involved, most Acolytes will wish to use the Cooperation rules, or at the very least some strong-backed servitors. With the hectic pace of Inquisitorial work, it’s unlikely that circumstance will allow them time to personally fit each piece of stone for a project. Labour or servitors that simply move blocks of stone rather than practising the skilled aspects of this trade do not count against the Cooperation rules.

#### Trade (Merchant)
**(Advanced, Crafting, Interaction)**
**Fellowship**

While the Barter skill covers immediate, short-term negotiations, the Trade (Merchant) skill represents the strategic manoeuvring and long-term dialogues necessary not only to close the deal but also to bring the other party to the table in the first place. Thus, you use Barter when haggling over the price of a data-slate, but use Trade (Merchant) when negotiating the rights to a stellar trade route between Landunder and the Lathes, or exclusive import rights to Hecuter firearms. These are discussions that may take months as opposed to minutes, and acts as a prolonged Interaction skill.

Depending on the nature of the negotiations, other Interaction Skills such as Blather, Charm, Deceive, and Intimidate could be used to help get the desired outcome. The GM may have the
characters roleplay specific meetings of the negotiations, for which he may grant a one-off bonus or penalty of +/–10 to the Test for that time interval as detailed in Step 4: Test Roles of the Crafting Rules. Alternately, he may allow the players to make an appropriate Interaction Skill Test for a similar modifier if they do not wish to roleplay the situation.

#### Trade (Miner)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Strength**

You are skilled in extracting stone, ore, gems or even promethium from the ground using a variety of methods, from drills and shovels to pumps and pipes. This Trade concentrates on removing the resource from the ground, as opposed to Trade (Prospector), which focuses on the detection or discovery of these valuable materials. Mineral wealth is not the only valuable commodity found under the ground; this Skill is also useful for the recovery of artefacts and antiquities when used with the proper care. You may also use this Skill to construct subsurface works suitable for eventual expansion into habitation or fortification. A mason or wright constructing an underground structure gains a +10 bonus on Crafting Tests if assisted by someone with the Trade
(Miner) skill. Likewise, a miner gains a +10 bonus on Crafting Tests if assisted by someone with the Demolition skill, assuming they’re digging for something neither fragile nor flammable!

Given the scale of most excavations, most miners have a workforce of some size to provide the brute force to move excavated dirt and stone out of the dig. These workers do not count as Cooperation, but simply allow for the miner to concentrate on technical aspects of the dig.

As most mining is done underground, having this Trade grants a +10 bonus on Navigation (Surface) Tests when inside large or underground structures, such as the underhive or tunnels.
#### Trade (Prospector)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Strength**

Acolytes with the Trade (Prospector) skill can survey an area to determine if it contains potentially valuable resources. Note that they will only be able to determine if those materials might be present, not their exact quantity, nor are they likely to discover things far removed from the subject of their search—although serendipitous, or unfortunate, findings are always possible.

When the Acolyte and GM look at Step One: Define the Task of the Crafting rules, they should carefully delineate the search, ensuring it is not too broad in scope. Thus, searching ten square kilometres for evidence of underground Promethium is perfectly acceptable, while prospecting “the plains” for “any valuable ores” would only be satisfactory if the Acolyte were armed with extensive testing apparatus and an army of assistants to comb through such a broad area. Simply searching for “any resources” is right out.

However, because the search for one material may very well give evidence of another, additional degrees of success may provide additional discoveries. Keep in mind Acolytes receive this additional information regardless of the existence of the material for which they originally searched.
##### Table: Prospector Test Results

| Degrees of Success    | Information Gained                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard              | Presence or absence of the resource searched for |
| One Degree            | Evidence of another related resource in the area |
| Two Degrees           | Proof of a specific related resource in the area |
| Three or more Degrees | Full information about all resources in the area |
#### Trade (Scrimshawer)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Agility**

You have the ability to inscribe artwork and text onto ivory, bone and similar substances. Typically done with a needle and ink, much in the same way as a tattoo, hunters have often created artwork on the bones of their trophies. However, this ability has broader applications, allowing you to permanently mark many other materials utilising inks or acids suitable to each medium. It is rumoured that a few zealous Chapters of the mighty Space Marines practise this art upon their own living bones to memorialise fallen comrades, while scrimshawed teeth of void krakens well-known heirlooms among voidsmen. 

At its most basic level, you use this Skill to determine if a material is suitable for scrimshaw, and to identify the proper “ink” for the process. Some only practise this art upon a hunting trophy, and some search for years to find a specific material for their work. As with the Trade (Apothecary) skill, the search for rare ivories or ingredients for inks can form entire adventures of their own.

This Skill interacts with a number of the other Crafting Skills: Trade (Apothecary) could assist in the creation of unique inks; Trade (Artist) might allow you to create a work of great beauty; Trade (Cartographer) may give assistance in engraving a map; Trade (Embalmer) can allow you to preserve your works from the ravages of time and decay. The GM should allow an appropriate bonus for creative Skill combinations.
#### Trade (Shipwright)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Strength**

An Acolyte with the Trade (Shipwright) Skill is capable of designing and overseeing the construction of one of mankind's greatest technical achievements: void-capable starcraft. This Skill encompasses the fundamentals of construction techniques and the technical base of various esoteric subjects specifically germane to voidships, including life sustainers, void shields, and even Gellar fields. Shipwrights are also of vital importance to the maintenance of existing voidcraft, which must undergo periodic overhauls to preserve their resilience against the ravages of the cruel and heartless void.

This Skill uses the Crafting rules, with scale and complexity directly tied to the type of voidcraft in question. An assault boat with up-rated engines would be on the smaller size, while a multi-kilometre mass conveyor would be naturally much closer to the top. After completion of the design, the construction is a separate Crafting task, using the appropriate Trade Skills, such as Trade (Armourer) for the voidship's systems and Trade (Smith) for its hull. Except for the smallest of vessels a shipwright must usually enlist the help of others to realise their plans.

Designing a larger voidship would almost certainly require both the Cooperation rules as well as judicious use of Dividing Tasks to bring the design time down to something reasonable. A single shipwright would take many months, if not a year or more, to design the entire deck plan of a cruiser, but could likely devise a single frame section of the hull (of which there are many) in a few weeks. Split among a cadre of other shipwrights, the cruiser would take form one section at a time as the plan forms are integrated with one another, each shipwright moving on to the next of their assigned tasks until the vessel is fully assembled.

While perhaps not an immediately obvious use, a trained shipwright can also intuit information and various insights about the construction and capabilities of existing voidcraft, such as whether a lighter is capable of atmospheric operation, or the approximate age and provenance of a wreck encountered in deep void. 
#### Trade (Smith)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Strength**

A character with the Trade (Smith) skill can shape or reshape metal, smelt alloys from ingots or ore, and forge all manners of weapons, tools and armour. Unlike some Trade skills, a smith requires a potentially extensive workshop, to include a heat source (forge), hammer block (anvil) and hammer, which may be powered by the smith’s arm or a machine. While a metalsmith working in gold or platinum might have a closet-sized workshop and miniature tools, the power hammers required for large-scale projects—or harder metals such as adamantium—can weigh upwards of 100 tonnes. Forges can vary in size from that of a ration box for a portable model to the legendary Titan-works on Mars that dwarf all but the grandest of Ecclesiastical cathedrals.

Suitably equipped, and using more advanced alloys than iron or steel, an Acolyte can create armours and blades without the Primitive quality as a **Difficult (–10) Crafting** task.

Smiths often work alongside those with the Trade (Armourer) or Trade (Wright) skill to create special items or armour. For example, while a smith could certainly create a suit of feral plate armour, in conjunction with an armourer he might integrate less primitive elements. Likewise, alongside a wright, he can build structural components or armoured plate for vehicles or fortifications.

Acolytes with the Trade (Smith) skill can also recognise the work of other masters in the field, using Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore as a guide.
#### Trade (Soothsayer)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Fellowship**

It is important to distinguish the Trade (Soothsayer) skill, which gives the appearance of telling the future, from psykers using warp-powered divination. Certain “gifted” fortune tellers combine these Skills, but generally speaking, psychology and intuition power this Skill rather than the unnatural insight of the warp. Soothsayers are observant and perceptive individuals, adept at piecing together minute elements of information about an individual and spinning a tale of the future tailored to what their mark wants to hear. They use many of the same trappings as true psykers, including the Emperor’s Tarot and fetishes, but these trapping are without any real power besides a keen intellect.

Trade (Soothsayer) works much in the same way as the Charm skill, influencing future actions of the individual whose fortune is being told. However, it acts over longer periods of time and allows for changes in the subject’s planned actions in addition to their opinions.

A successful Skill Test convinces the subject of the authenticity of the soothsayer’s skills. After this, the player and GM should discuss the time frame and desired outcome of the fortunetelling sessions using the Crafting rules.
#### Trade (Tanner)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Strength**

An Acolyte with the Trade (Tanner) skill treats animal hides to create supple, durable leathers used for clothing, armour or equipment. From semi-rigid armour cured from carnodon hide to soft and durable boots stitched from b’llek skin to a cape made from a crotalid pelt, tanners can fabricate all manner of equipment with their trade. Use of this Skill also encompasses the long-term care of leathers to prevent decay, cracking and other adverse effects of age.

Different animal hides necessitate different tanning methods, in both method and duration of the process. Generally, the more thick, tough or durable the skin, the more steps are necessary for treatment. Tanners require suitable chemicals for each step of the process, which due to their noxious smell often banish the trade to the outskirts—or under levels—of many cities. This may make them unpopular with their fellow Acolytes if operating out of cramped quarters.

You can also use this Skill to determine the type of creature from which a particular leather was manufactured, using Table 9-3: Trade Skills Lore.
#### Trade (Technomat)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Intelligence**

The Trade (Technomat) skill differs from most of the other Trade Skills in that it represents the care and maintenance of items rather than their creation. However, as the mysteries of creation for many items from the Dark Age of Technology are now jealously guarded by the Adeptus Mechanicus, or in some cases actually and truly forever lost, this Skill has great value throughout the Imperium.

A technomat represents a broad segment of technical laymen—skilled labourers who are versed in the necessary rites to service and maintain technology, but who lack a formally ordained tech-priest's greater knowledge of machine spirits and other techno-esoterica. An Acolyte so trained would be fully aware of the efficacy of the holy oils and unguents, specific chants made in the haze of an incense burner, and the correct application of a sacred spanner onto a rune of ignition, but is otherwise largely ignorant of the underlying purpose any of those procedures serve to keep the machine in question functioning. That knowledge is reserved by the Mechanicus—the technomat need only know the what and the how, not the why.

An Acolyte trained as a technomat can repair and modify gear and equipment as if they had the Trade (Armourer) Skill, although not as easily given their more rudimentary knowledge of the fundamentals of the machine. You may substitute Trade (Technomat) for Trade (Armourer) when performing repairs or modifying equipment, however the difficulty of such Tests increase by one-step, and you generally cannot create items from scratch. Further, the GM may decide that certain pieces of gear are simply too arcane or complex to be worked on using this Skill.

The Skill may also be used to create effective rituals for newly discovered items, based upon the vast knowledge of customs for similar devices. Thus, if the Acolytes discover an ancient cogitator, their technomat might attempt to placate its machine-spirit with rituals known for similar machines.
#### Trade (Valet)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Fellowship**

You have the ability to shrewdly provide for the needs of another for a range of requirements, including administrative and personal needs, and can even supervise a staff administering to these needs on a larger scale. Individuals with this Skill often use the title “majordomo” or “chief of staff”.

At the most trivial level, this Skill addresses immediate concerns, such as selection of appropriate apparel for a meeting with an Imperial Governor or picking a suitable refreshment for a Clan Lord of Tallarn. Successful use of this Skill grants a +10 bonus on all Tests of an Interaction Skill of your choice, for either yourself or the host, representing the favourable impression generated by these thoughtful touches. For every two degrees of success on this Test you may designate an additional Interaction Skill to receive this bonus. The effect lasts for the duration of the event you were preparing for.

It may not be immediately apparent how to reconcile this Skill with the Crafting rules, but there are a number of Extended Tests that qualify:
• Maintaining a schedule of appointments and duties for a lengthy period of time.
• Assembling a proper wardrobe for a specific culture or Imperial region.
• Making arrangements for a large conclave of Inquisitorial representatives.

For these long-term Tests, the resultant Craftsmanship may impart certain bonuses at the GM's discretion.
#### Trade (Wright)
**(Advanced, Crafting)**
**Intelligence**

Acolytes use the Trade (Wright) skill for large-scale design and construction Tests. Buildings, bridges, monuments, industrial works, and terrestrial vehicles fall under this broad expertise. While this Skill grants you the ability to design structures and vehicular systems, an Acolyte will rarely have all the tools and equipment necessary to realise his designs without significant outside assistance. It’s all well and good to design a 200 metre marble arch celebrating the victory of Imperial forces over the Overfiend of Octarius, but quite another to actually build it!

Acolytes use the Crafting rules to formulate their design, determining appropriate modifiers for scale and complexity. After completion of the design, the construction is a separate Crafting task, using the appropriate Trade Skills, such as Trade (Mason) for a bunker or Trade (Smith) for armour plating on a battle bike. Wrights must usually enlist the help of others to realise their plans. Many masons, smiths and artists must all join skills to raise your Imperial victory arch.

For large or complex jobs, you may wish to utilise the Cooperation rules or split a job into smaller sub-tasks using the Dividing Tasks section to reduce the overall time necessary for completion. It might take one Wright a decade to design an entire hive city hab-unit, but he might complete the plans for the superstructure in a fraction of that time while others focus on different portions of the project.

You may also use the Trade (Wright) skill to gain information about the constructs or fabrications of others, such as the STC design upon which a speeder was based or the school of design for a bridge. Use Table 9-3: Trade Skill Lore as a guide to determine the information gained.

Note this Skill does not cover the design and construction of void-capable starcraft—see Trade (Shipwright) for that particularly challenging task.
## **Wrangling 
(Advanced) 
Intelligence

Despite the great technological advancements of the Imperium, many worlds still rely on beasts of burden to carry them about. An Acolyte who is as comfortable on a riding mount as he is on a bike will rarely be left without a mode of transport.

This Skill may be used in order to ride domesticated animals of appropriate size.

The Wrangling skill also allows you to care for and control domesticated animals, like bloodhounds, Spike Pigs, horses, Grox and the like. Routine care and feeding requires no Test, but you may be called to make one to spot developing illnesses or signs of discomfort, or for special grooming (preparing a mount for a parade, for instance).

Wrangling can also be used to train animals to perform tricks and obey simple commands. Properly training an animal takes some time. Tests should be made once a week during training. A simple trick can be learned with one successful Test, a moderately difficult trick can be learned with three successful Tests and a difficult trick can be learned with ten successful Tests. Common tricks include guarding, fetching, attacking, and so on.

You may also use this Skill to befriend animals. Domestic animals are always friendly to you. Wild animals or those trained to be hostile (like attack dogs) can be calmed with a successful Test. GMs may impose penalties for particularly loyal or ornery animals.

Wrangling is of no use against cybernetic or synthetic creatures, such as cyber-mastiffs or grapplehawks—even if they are built to resemble an animal, you must still use the Tech-Use Skill to wrangle such things.

A Wrangling Test takes a variable amount of time, depending on what the character is attempting to accomplish. Training an animal takes at least a week of hard work, whereas attempting to befriend an animal is a Full Action.
#### **Riding Animals**

Any animal that’s been trained can be ridden without having to Test Wrangling. You simply climb onto the mount (a Half Action) and ride off into the “setting suns”.

Should the animal be unfriendly (i.e. it has not been trained), odds are that if you manage to get into the saddle, you won’t stay there for long. To calm such an animal so you can ride it, you must make a Wrangling Test with a Difficulty depending on the beast’s Disposition (set by the GM and accounting for your appearance, the animal’s mood and the circumstances of the encounter). On a successful Test, you may climb up and ride. On a failure, the beast objects and tries to throw you off, requiring a **Difficult (–10) Agility Test**. If you pass, you may attempt another Wrangling Test, otherwise you are thrown off (flying 1d5 metres in a random direction). To gain control over an uncontrolled beast, you must succeed on a number of Wrangling Tests equal to the mount’s Willpower Bonus. If you fail any of the Tests by four or more degrees, the beast is untameable and will never allow you to ride it; you’ll have to find another means of transport!
