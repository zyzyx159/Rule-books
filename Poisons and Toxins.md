# Introduction:

There exist a dizzying multitude of virulent substances that attack a man's bodily humors, leading to sickness, incapacitation, or even death. Some are the natural venom of predatory beasts, siphoned off for more nefarious purposes, while others are deliberately man made; whether the latter are gathered toxic pollutants of Imperial society, or purposefully created banes from a death cult's laboratorium, usually matters little for the user, and even less for the victim.

Attitudes towards the willful use of poison vary widely. On infamously deceitful Malfi, poisoning one's rivals or enemies is just another tool to advance up the social and political ladder, while on Acreage anyone who would dispatch their hated foe with poison instead of a sharp blade would be roundly discredited. Regardless of how acceptable the use of poison is found amongst polite company, those "in the know" are well advised that a successful poisoner has a steady hand, at least some scholarly knowledge, and the utterly cold will to use them. Indeed, an astute observer might come to conclude that the only meaningful distinction between the merciful lifesaving medicae and an assassin bearing poison is their attitude towards the "client".

In game terms, poisons and toxins are classified with three criteria: speed, strength, and effect. Rules for these qualities are described as follows.

## Speed

Speed defines how quickly the poison will enter the victim's system and begin to take its effects upon their physiology.

### Instant:
The poison's effect is felt as soon as the victim is exposed. The bites and stings of venomous creatures as well as poisoned blades and weapons with the Toxic quality operate at this speed unless otherwise noted.

### Swift:
The effects of the poison aren't felt for 1d5 hours after exposure. Poisons and toxins that are inhaled or ingested tend to operate at this speed.

### Slow:
This poison advances hideously slowly, only making its effects felt after 1d5 days. Persistent environmental poisons and taints, including penetrating radiation, usually operate at this speed.

## Strength

Some folk are hardier than others, and a poison that could fell one victim might leave another entirely unscathed. When exposed to a poison or toxin a victim must make a Toughness Test, whose difficulty is set by the poison's strength. Success indicates the victim is able to shrug off the poison's effects, while failure causes them to suffer the same.

## Effect

The great majority of poisons or toxins fall into one of the four following effects, although more unique or unusual outcomes are certainly possible – it is, after all, a big galaxy with no shortage of nightmarish horrors lurking about.

### Lethal:
This poison assaults the body's vital functions, damaging the nervous system, causing an infarction, or paralyzing the victim's lungs, among other such unpleasantness. A lethal poison causes the victim to suffer 1d10 temporary Toughness Damage plus a further 1d10 per degree of failure, if any. If the victim's Toughness is reduced to below 1 they die, although prompt intervention by a skilled medicae may yet be able to save them.

Additionally, if more than half of the victim's Toughness is lost to a single exposure they also become comatose for 1d5 hours.

### Paralytic:
This poison causes paralysis of the musculature, incapacitating the victim (but not rendering them unconscious!). A paralytic poison causes the victim suffers 1d10 temporary Strength Damage plus a further 1d10 per degree of failure, if any. If the victim's Strength is reduced to less than 1 they are completely paralyzed and may take no actions save for those that are strictly mental. Most paralytic poisons wear off in 2d5 hours minus the victim's Toughness Bonus, although especially potent ones could take much longer.

### Sedative:
This poison staggers its victim's mind, rendering them into a sluggish heap, or possibly completely unconscious depending on the poison's potency. A sedative poison causes the victim to be Stunned for 1d10 minutes; if the victim fails their Toughness Test by two or more degrees they instead fall unconscious for 1d5 hours.

### Necrotic:
This poison causes localized damage to the body directly, often through corroding tissues or causing chemical burns to the wounded area. Many powerful acids or solvents, along with certain industrial pollutants, can be considered a necrotic poison – natural examples would include venom used by jaw less predators to liquefy and digest their prey. Needle weapons, used by both Imperial and xeno snipers and assassins, typically make use of this sort of poison to fell their targets. A necrotic poison causes Damage to the victim's Wounds with no reduction for armor or Toughness Bonus. Most common necrotic poisons inflict 1d10 Damage; weaker examples might "only" cause 1d5, while particularly devastating ones could reach 2d10.

Should it be necessary to determine what sort of Damage the victim has suffered – for example, with respect to Critical Damage – a necrotic poison could inflict Energy, Impact, or Rending effects depending on the nature of the specific bane in question.

## USING POISON

In absolute terms, anyone trained in the use of a needle rifle is using poison, but this is the work of an amateur in the eyes of the skilled poisoner.

Using poison directly – that is to say not in the context of a drug loaded in an auto-injector or a weapon with the Toxic quality – requires a successful Chem-Use Test, which is a Full Action. The difficulty is usually Ordinary (+10), although the GM should feel free to adjust that up or down for poisons that are either very stable or harder to safely handle. Success indicates the poison is applied to a dagger, loaded into a dart caster projectile, or sprinkled into a victim's meal, while failure causes the poison to be wasted due to improper handling or storage. If the poisoner fails their Chem-Use Test by five or more degrees they poison themselves instead!

The Chem-Use Test to prepare a poison can (and probably should…) be concealed using Sleight of Hand as normal, which can be quite handy when attempting to poison someone in a social environment.

Residual poison can often be detected by a skilled medicae with a toxin wand (or an inquester if the victim has succumbed to the poison's effects). A poisoner that wishes to obfuscate their role in the victim's affliction may attempt a Difficult (-10) Chem-Use Test when they ready their poison; success indicates the difficulty of any Tests made to identify the poison later increase by one step, plus an additional step for each degrees of success the poisoner might have achieved.

# INFAMOUS POISONS OF THE CALIXIS SECTOR

Maintaining a truly comprehensive list of all the toxic and poisonous compounds a man might encounter in Calixis is a monstrous undertaking best suited for a cadre of bespectacled adepts. With that said, most experienced poisoners would at least be familiar with the following better-known varieties.

### Ars Imperialis Mortua
(Instant/–30/Lethal)

Mortua for short, this is the unquestioned "prince of poisons" and is widely believed to have originally been developed by the Imperium's enigmatic Officio Assassinorum itself. No expense was spared in the development and production of Mortua; it kills almost immediately, its victims keeling over moments after being struck by a poisoned dart or blade. The cadaver deoxygenates with visibly rapid speed, leading some medicae to refer to it as "grey death" as the victim's body swiftly loses all color and their eyes white over.

### Ash Slug Secretion
(Instant/+10/Paralytic and Necrotic 1d5)

This caustic slime is secreted by waste-eating ash slugs which can be found in the more fetid areas of hive cities. The foul secretion helps the slugs break down and absorb their meals, and also serves as a deterrent to any other predators lurking in the darkness which might try to feast on one of the fatty vermin. While the ash slugs themselves are slow moving, and the toxic effects of their slime aren't terribly powerful, a large number of them can still pose a dire threat to the unwary. For their part, the slugs are more than happy to consume fresh meat instead of their usual diet of carrion and decaying organic matter. As it is fairly easy to acquire for those in the know, ash slug secretion is a common poison for low-hive scav-gangers.

### Black Janix Venom
(Instant/+10/Lethal + hallucinogen effect)

This venomous snake, originally native to the death world of Woe in the Josian Reach, has invaded the humid tropical regions of many worlds after specimens escaped in the cargo of outbound void ships. Victims experience mind bending visions and delirium as the poison runs through their bodies – aside from the Toughness Damage, a victim also suffers the effects of a hallucinogen grenade (see page 137 of _Dark Heresy_ for more information).

### Dusk Lotus
(Swift/–10/Lethal, Damage is permanent)

The feral world of Dusk is infamous for a wide variety of utterly deadly flora and fauna, with this abominably toxic flower being one of the best-known exemplars. Also referred to as the "corpse bloom", especially by Dusk's benighted natives, exposure to Dusk Lotus extract frequently cripples victims that don't receive immediate medical aid.

Dusk lotus extract is typically applied to a blade and introduced to the body by a wound. If available in a powdered form it can also be inhaled, although the Toughness Test to resist its effects becomes merely Challenging (+0) instead. A victim exposed to dust lotus extract who has failed their Toughness Test but has not yet suffered its effects can benefit from a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to improve their odds of recuperating from the poison; if the medicae is successful, the Toughness Damage becomes temporary instead of permanent.

### Maidens Foil Powder
(Swift/+0/Sedative)

Maidens Foil is a common medicinal herb found on the feudal world of Acreage with notably allaying qualities. Maidens Foil tinctures are a common remedy for hysteria there, and the stuff is sold off-world to those looking for "all natural" calmatives. Pure maidens foil is remarkably more powerful, inducing a profound state of somnolence that comes on gradually after ingestion. Victims who have been drugged unawares by maidens Foil often have no idea they've been poisoned unless they've experienced its particular effects before.

### Morphia-V
(Instant/–20/Sedative)

Derived from the same base compound as the medicinal drug pain immune, this is among the most powerful "knockout" poisons known to Imperial chymists. Morphia was originally conceived to sedate dangerous beasts on agriworlds (or to add to a noble's menagerie); the "V" variant is weak enough to use on humans with minimal risk of sedating them to death.

### Nephys Orchid
(Slow/–30/Paralytic)

Extract of Nephys Orchid is the base from which the powerful drug somna is derived, making it one of the most valuable commodities on its native Iocanthus (although still a distant second to ghost fire pollen). Nephys orchid extract must be ingested; once metabolized in the body, the victim will quite abruptly lose control of their physical faculties, possibly toppling over at an inopportune moment.

Should the victim's Strength be reduced to 0 they fall into a death-like comatose state for 2d5 hours (no reduction for Toughness Bonus). The victim appears to be dead to casual observation, requiring a Challenging (+0) Medicae Test to reveal that the victim is still alive. An auspex or medispex can also see through this false death, although any Tests using those or similar devices are Hard (–20). The victim's Strength returns slowly as the poison is excreted from the body; use the normal rules for Characteristic Damage on page 200 of _Dark Heresy_ instead of returning their Strength at once.

### Sump Vine Sap
(Slow/+0/Lethal)

"Sump vines" are a catchall term for the grotesque-looking creeping pseudo-plant life that tends to grow out of the vast accumulations of effluent in the deepest, most foreboding levels of great hive cities. While typically thought of as a nuisance whose infestation clogs up ventilators and pneumo-tube relays, sump vines can prove extremely dangerous if they manage to contaminate a hive's water distribution network. Their sap is an especially potent toxin, and there's often a good trade in reclaimators harvesting the stuff for sale to customers looking to make a murder plausibly resemble an accidental poisoning.

### Torpor
(Instant/–20/Sedative or Special)

Long associated with the Adeptus Telepathica's infamous League of Black ships, torpor is an extremely specialized cocktail of narcotics and neural-inhibitors designed specifically to incapacitate psykers. Although perfectly capable of knocking out "blunts", torpor has far more profound effects when used against a psyker, powerfully clouding their minds and hindering, if not entirely preventing, their ability to focus on the manifestation of a psychic ability. The masters of the Black ships use this substance to help corral their eminently dangerous passengers, whilst agents of the Holy Ordos and the best-funded enforcer cadres utilize torpor to quickly detain rogue psykers and sorcerers. Regrettably, a few heretical organisations and cultists also seem to be able to procure supplies of this powerful admixture for their own dark purposes involving those with the psyker's gift.

Torpor functions as listed unless it is used against a creature with a Psy Rating, or the ability to manifest psychic powers (this would include a man under the influence of spook). In such an event, the psychic victim is deeply plunged into a grey, anxiety-ridden haze for 2d5 hours minus their Toughness Bonus. During this time the psyker counts as Fatigued, must succeed on a Hard (–20) Willpower Test to perform any actions besides listlessly staggering about, and reduces their Psy Rating by 4. Should this reduce the victim's Psy Rating to below 1 they cannot manifest any psychic powers or abilities until the torpor wears off.

### Tox-Jack
(Instant/–10/Necrotic 1d10)

This is an extremely prevalent poison that can be cheaply and (relatively) easily distilled from common industrial coolant used on most civilized worlds. The low cost and chemical stability make it an ideal payload for needle weapons; the example here is a "packaged" format suitable for applying to a blade.
