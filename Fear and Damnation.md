*"Every soul wavers between the Void and the Emperor's Holy Light. Most falter."*

— Inquisitor Kaede, Ordo Hereticus.

The 41st Millennium is a dark and terrible place where mankind's billions inhabit a universe filled with unnumbered horrors and countless dangers. Murderous aliens stalk the cold stars, rebellion and treachery fester within the shadow of the Imperium's decaying might and nightmarish forces eternally claw at the very fabric of reality from beyond, seeking both to feast and to corrupt. The Acolytes must struggle against this backdrop of sinister menace, dark violence and entropy, and fear; horror, madness, and the subtle taint of Chaos are fundamental aspects of the games you will play.

The rules presented here reflect these many threats to the mind and soul, and how the player characters interact with them. They are separated into three distinct, interlinking sections: **Fear** covers a character's immediate reaction to frightening events and creatures, **Insanity** details with the long-term effects of mental trauma on a character, while **Corruption** deals with the insidious influence of the warp and forbidden knowledge. 

During combat encounters you will likely have to deal with the consequences of Fear on a regular basis, while the effects of Insanity and Corruption are generally dealt with in the aftermath of a battle rather than during it.
# **Insanity and Corruption Points**

Insanity Points (IP) and Corruption Points (CP) are Characteristics that characters gain during play. Both of these scores begin at 0 when a player starts and increase over time as damage is done to a character's state of mind (Insanity) and the purity of his soul (Corruption). The higher these scores, the more twisted, deranged, and debilitated a character becomes. Should either of these scores ever reach 100 the character's career is usually over as he succumbs to madness or hopeless depravity, although in rare cases those of especially strong will might be able to persevere. The horror of what such a creature would become could well necessitate his fellow Acolytes to retire him more forcibly, however...
# **Fear**

Fear comes into effect when the Acolytes are confronted with scenes of atrocity or horror, or when they are called on to battle against terrifying aliens, insane perversions of science and nightmarish entities from the warp. When an Acolyte is confronted by such a frightening event or adversary, they must take a **Fear Test**; this is a **Willpower Test**, modified by how frightening the thing is. If the Acolyte passes this Test then he may continue to act as normal. If he fails however, he succumbs to Fear.
## **Degrees of Fear**

Some things are clearly more frightening than others; for an Acolyte, having a gun waved in his face by a ganger, although obviously dangerous, is not sufficient to call for a Fear Test. However, having a gun waved at him by the walking corpse of his dead brother, while luminous white spiders scurry in and out of his bloodless open wounds—that calls for a somewhat severe one. The **Table: Fear Test Difficulties** outlines the relative severity of Fear Tests you may be called to make, while **Very Bad Things** below offers some guidelines on what might provoke Fear Tests at each level thereof.
#### **Table: Fear Test Difficulties**

| Severity of Fear     | Test Mod | Example Adversaries                                   |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Fear (1) Disturbing  | (0)      | Ambull, blood locust swarm, grotesque mutant          |
| Fear (2) Frightening | (–10)    | Carnosaur, lesser daemon, murder servitor             |
| Fear (3) Horrifying  | (–20)    | Astral spectre, Tyranid warrior, khymera              |
| Fear (4) Terrifying  | (–30)    | Avatar of Khaine, greater daemon, Tyranid hive tyrant |
#### **Very Bad Things**

Presented here are a few appropriate examples of events that can force a Fear Test beyond the mere appearance of a horrifying enemy

* **Disturbing (0)**: Viewing a scene of a gruesome murder or extremely heretical ritual, minor supernatural phenomena such as witch lights, spectral voices, or weeping statues, hostile tanks bearing down on your position ("tank shock").
* **Frightening (–10)**: Meeting someone you know is dead, being buried alive or falling into a sump spider's web, major supernatural phenomena such as blood raining from the sky or the faces of paintings contorting into shrieking expressions.
* **Horrifying (–20**): A man you were just talking to suddenly and inexplicably dies and a writhing mass of fanged worms erupt from his corpse, coming under a heavy and sustained artillery barrage, finding yourself covered in blood, surrounded by corpses with a butcher's knife in hand and no memory of how you got there.
* **Terrifying (–30)**: Realising you're about to be servitorised, being trapped on a voidship during a Gellar Field failure, the dead spontaneously rising across an entire world, staring unprotected into the warp.
## **Failing the Fear Test**

If you fail a Fear Test in a combat situation you must immediately roll on **Table: Shock**, adding +10 to the result for each degree of failure, if any. You immediately suffer the effects listed.

If you fail a Fear Test outside of a combat situation you becomes unnerved and suffer a -10 penalty to any Tests that require concentration on your part. This penalty lasts as long as you remain in the vicinity of the object of your Fear (simply leaving and coming back again doesn't stop this!).

In addition, if a non-combat Fear Test is failed by three degrees or more, the experience proves so unsettling that you also gain 1d5 Insanity Points.
## **Shock and Snapping Out of It**

You may be able to shake off some of the effects of Fear after the initial shock has worn off. Where specified on **Table: Shock** that a character may "snap out of it", you can make a Willpower Test on your next Turn. If this succeeds then you regain your senses, shrug off the immediate effects and may act normally again from then on. If you fail this Test, the effect continues, and you may try again on your next Turn.

Note that even if you successfully "snap out of it" this does not negate any Insanity Points gained or Characteristic Damage suffered as a result of failing the Fear Test in the first place.
#### **Table: Shock**

**Roll a d100 and add 10 for every degree of failure on the Fear Test.**

| Roll    | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–20   | The character is badly startled. He may only take a single Half Action when in his next Turn, but afterwards he may act normally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 21–40   | Fear grips the character and he begins to shake and tremble. He is at a –10 penalty on all Tests for the rest of the encounter unless he can **snap out of it**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 41–60   | Reeling with shock, the character backs away from the thing that confronts them. The character cannot willingly approach the object of his fear, but may otherwise act normally, with a –10 penalty on all Tests until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1 Insanity Point.                                                                                                  |
| 61–80   | The character is frozen by paralytic terror. The character may make no Actions until he **snaps out of it**. After snapping out of it, the character will make all Tests with a –10 penalty for the rest of the encounter. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.                                                                                                                     |
| 81–100  | Panic grips the character. He must flee the source of his fear, if able, as fast as he can, and if prevented from doing so he may only take Half Actions and is at a –20 penalty to all Tests. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points. Once away from the danger he must successfully **snap out of it** to regain control.                                                            |
| 101–120 | Fainting dead away, the character keels over and remains unconscious for 1d5 Rounds. Once he regain consciousness he is still shaken and takes all Tests with a –10 penalty until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.                                                                                                                                    |
| 121–130 | Totally overcome, the character falls to his hands and knees and vomits uncontrollably for 1d5 Rounds. During this time he is Helpless, make take no Actions, and drops anything he is holding. Afterwards, until the end of the encounter, the character may only take a single Half Action each Turn. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.                                        |
| 131–140 | The character is overcome with hysteria and randomly attacks anything near him in a laughing, manic frenzy, firing wildly or using whatever weapon he has to hand. This effect lasts until the character **snaps out of it**, or until he is knocked unconscious. The character gains 1d5 Insanity Points.                                                                              |
| 141–150 | The character crumples to the ground for 1d5+1 Rounds, sobbing and gibbering incoherently and tearing at his own flesh, and may take no Actions. Even after he returns to his senses, he is a complete mess and at a –20 penalty on all Tests until the end of the encounter. The character gains 1d5+1 Insanity Points.                                                                |

| 161–170 | The character's hold on reality shatters as strange and terrible visions take hold of him. The character is treated as if he was struck by a hallucinogen grenade for the next 2d10 Rounds. Once the hallucinations have passed the character makes all Tests at a –20 penalty while the encounter lasts and gains 2d10 Insanity Points while suffering 1d5 permanent Willpower Damage. |
| 171+    | The character is so overcome with fear that his heart stops. The character must make a Toughness Test or die from a catastrophic infarction. If he succeeds on the test his heart starts beating again, but he still falls Unconscious for 1d5 hours, gains 2d10 Insanity Points and suffers 1d10 permanent Willpower Damage.                                                           |

# **Going Insane**

Characters in ***Dark Heresy*** are at the centre of terrible events: battling indescribable horrors, uncovering shocking truths and engaging in desperate struggles where the lives and souls of countless innocents may hang in the balance. Such are the stresses and terror involved that the slow slide into madness is a constant threat. No human mind, not even one hardened by the harsh rigours of life as an Acolyte of the Inquisition, is immune to the gradual erosion of sanity facing those who would constantly stand in defiance of mankind's innumerable enemies.

In ***Dark Heresy*** these dangers are quantified by Insanity Points. Insanity Points represent the strain put on a character's mind by his experiences; the more Insanity Points a character has the more fragile his mind. The cumulative effects of gaining Insanity Points are divided into Traumas, which represent the short term after-effects of particularly terrible experiences, and Disorders, which are permanent mental afflictions that sign-post a character's slide into total madness.
## **Degress of Madness**

A character is classified as having a certain degree of madness depending on how many Insanity Points they have. This classification gives a player a broad idea of the state of a character's mind and how close to the edge he has become. A character's degree of madness also determines the modifier that will apply to Tests taken to avoid Mental Trauma.
## **Mental Trauma**

Mental Trauma represents the relatively short-term damage to a character's state of mind that he suffers after experiencing a horrific or supernatural event. Each time the character gains 10 Insanity Points he must make a Trauma Test. This is a Willpower Test, modified in difficulty by how many Insanity Points the character has accrued in total (see **Table: The Insanity Track**). If the Test is passed the character manages to cope with his experience without extra ill effect. If the Test is failed roll d100, adding 10 for every degree of failure, and comparing the result to **Table: Mental Traumas**. The result is applied to the character in the aftermath of any encounter that inflicted the Insanity Points on him.
## **Gaining Mental Disorders** 

Mental disorders reflect the permanent, long-term effects on a character's mind of exposure to things horrific and unnatural. A new disorder (or a more severe version of an existing disorder) is automatically gained each time the character has enough Insanity Points to increase his degree of madness by one stage as shown on **Table: The Insanity Track**. When a character acquires a disorder, the severity of that disorder will depend on his new degree of madness, as shown.

A character must have the preceding severity of a disorder for it to get worse, (so for a disorder to have become "Severe" the character must have the "Minor" version of the disorder first, with the exception of "The Flesh is Weak" that has no Minor version).
##### **Table: The Insanity Track**

| Insanity Points | Degree of Madness | Trauma Modifier | Disorders  |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| 0–9             | Stable            | n/a             | None       |
| 10–19           | Unsettled         | +10             | —          |
| 20–29           | Unsettled         | +10             | —          |
| 30–39           | Unsettled         | +10             | —          |
| 40–49           | Disturbed         | +0              | 1st–Minor  |
| 50–59           | Disturbed         | +0              | —          |
| 60–69           | Unhinged          | –10             | 2nd–Severe |
| 70–79           | Unhinged          | –10             | —          |
| 80–89           | Deranged          | –20             | 3rd–Acute  |
| 90–99           | Deranged          | –20             | —          |

At 100 Insanity Points a character is considered terminally insane, having completely lost any grasp of reality around them. Normally, this retires a character from play—an Acolyte constantly arguing with his deceased comrades and liable to mistake their Inquisitor for a heretical cult leader when startled can't be expected to carry on in his duties. However, if one were to have succumbed far enough to the hideous temptations of Chaos he may find insanity to be quite a comforting companion to his dark new perceptions...
##### **Only the Insane Shall Prosper**

The more insane a character becomes the less terrifying things seem. After all, what are the monsters of reality compared to those one sees whenever one closes one’s eyes? Once a character has become Unsettled, if the first digit of his total Insanity Points is double or more an adversary or scene's Fear Rating the character is merely disgusted or repulsed by it instead of being horrified and does not need to make a Fear Test to continue as normal.
##### Example
*Quinn Valentine is facing down a hulking Ork raider that has just smashed through the armoured door separating Valentine from the xeno.  Valentine has 21 Insanity Points, and so will be unaffected by the Ork's Fear Rating of 1. Keeping his wits about him, Valentine grabs his chainsword and prepares to do battle with the maniacally violent brute on an even footing.*
##### **Table: Mental Traumas**

**Roll a d100 and add 10 for every degree of failure on the Trauma Test.**

| Roll    | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This effect lasts for 1d10 days.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
##### Example
*Rylar Mane has been captured by Eldar Corsairs and is being held aboard their vessel as they subject him to their alien tortures. This traumatic event increases Mane’s Insanity Points to a total of 10, forcing him to make a Trauma Test by rolling against his Willpower with a penalty of –10. If he fails, he will then need to roll on the Mental Traumas table and suffer the results. Should he later gain another 10 Insanity Points, increasing his total to 20, he would need to test once more. If his total were to reach 40, in addition to testing again he would also gain his first disorder—something the Eldar likely have little compunction against.*
## **Disorders and Their Severity**

The effect a mental disorder has on a character is left largely up to the GM, though the descriptions presented below provide some guidelines. If a character finds himself in a situation or encounter where his disorder will be a detriment, he can Test Willpower. Success means he is able to ignore the effects of the disorder for the remainder of the encounter. A character with a “fear of insects” for example, would have to Test Willpower before entering a crypt full of beetles and spiders. Success means he could enter with only some discomfort, while failure could mean anything from the character suffering penalties as long as he was inside, to him not being able to enter the crypt at all.

All disorders are rated as being **Minor**, **Severe** or **Acute** in ascending order of effect.

**Minor Disorder:** The effects of the disorder manifest rarely or are experienced only to a small degree. Any Test to overcome the effects of the disorder gain a +10 bonus. 

**Severe Disorder:** The effects of the disorder are stronger and may occur regularly. There is no modifier to Tests made to overcome the effects of the disorder.

**Acute Disorder:** The effects of the disorder are very strong and occur at the slightest stimulation. Any Test to overcome the effects of the disorder take a –10 penalty.
## **Types of Mental Disorders**

There is potentially no end to the variety of unpleasant and unwholesome disorders that might afflict a character, and a few examples are presented here. The GM should feel free to invent their own disorders to suit individual characters and the horrors they undergo.
### **The Flesh is Weak!**
**Seriousness:** Severe, Acute.

The character sees his flesh as weak and will constantly blame it for his failures and problems. He will also try to change and/or remove his flesh, becoming increasingly obsessed with surgical modification as well as bionic replacement.
### **Phobia**
**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character has a deep dislike and fear for a particular thing or circumstance. A phobic character must succeed on a Willpower Test to interact with the focus of his phobia. Enforced or gratuitous exposure to the focus of his exposure may incur Fear Tests. Examples of this disorder are:
##### **Fear of Crowds**
The character cannot stand being around large groups of people, the crushing mass of humanity hiding any number of weapons held with malicious intent...
##### **Fear of the Dark**
After a terrifying encounter with something creeping in the darkness the character cannot tolerate being without some kind of light source, even while sleeping.
##### **Fear of the Dead**
The character has an abiding fear and loathing of corpses and the dead, possibly due to the fact that sometimes they don't stay dead…
##### **Fear of Insects**
Scuttling things with many legs are the character's waking nightmare: faceless, numberless and hungry, forever hungry.
##### **Fear of Tight Spaces**
While some might find the inside of a closet (or a battle tank) to be a comforting and safe space, the character is absolutely horrified of being trapped anywhere he can't stretch out his arms.
### **Obsession/Compulsion**
**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character has a compulsion to perform a particular action or is obsessed with a particular thing. A character must make a Willpower Test not to act in a compulsive way or not pursue his obsession when the opportunity arises. Examples of this disorder include any of the following:
##### **Hygiene**
The God-Emperor values cleanliness, but the character is entirely fixated on keeping their body free of filth, obsessively washing any time he notices (or perceives) that he's even slightly soiled.
##### **Kleptomania**
The character compulsively steals small objects if he has the opportunity, often attaching no value to such objects beyond the satisfaction of stealing it in the first place.
##### **Self-Mortification**
The character must scourge and whip his flesh on a regular basis (or after a particular event, such as killing an enemy), in order to purge away the sin of his actions through pain.
### **Visions and Voices**
**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character sees things that are not there and hears things that others do not. Acute sufferers may be completely immersed within their visions.
##### **Dead Comrade**
The character hears the voice of an old friend now long-dead. At a Severe level, he may have visions of his friend. If his condition becomes Acute, they may even hold conversations.
##### **Flashbacks**
The character relives traumatic moments from his life. The length and vividness of these episodes vary according to the seriousness of his condition.
##### **Nemesis**
The character's fears or guilt manifest themselves as a hallucinatory foe, a distinct entity that seeks to antagonise, frighten, or demoralise the character. At the Acute level the character might actively try to argue with, fight, or flee from their hated enemy.
### **Delusion**
**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe, Acute.

The character suffers from a particular false belief that he has to act on as if it were the truth, despite his better judgement or evidence to the contrary.
##### **Foreboding**
The character sees his own demise all around him, neurotically speculating on all the various ways doom could befall him at a given moment. Such a character might demand to verify an area is "safe" before entering it, no matter how unlikely a misfortune there might be.
##### **Invulnerability**
The character believes that he will never get severely injured, either through luck or divine providence. Such a character would have to pass a Willpower Test not to enter a ganghouse and throw insults and punches instead of exercising due caution, for example.
##### **Righteousness**
The character believes his choices are right and justified, no matter what the cost. Such a character might claim to be a Puritan despite using proscribed knowledge, or refuse to act subtly where it would otherwise be prudent to do so.
### **Horrific Nightmares**
**Seriousness:** Minor, Severe.

The character suffers from vivid and reoccurring nightmares; trying to run from a black sun in the sky, or being imprisoned in an endless machine, for example. After any stressful day, the character must pass a Willpower Test in order not to succumb to his terrors while asleep. If he fails, the character will suffer from a single level of Fatigue on the following day.
## **Restoring the Mind** 

Short of being mind-cleansed nothing can truly restore an insane Acolyte to his original healthy psyche (and even that most extreme recourse isn't entirely foolproof). However, there are various ways to reduce the psychological damage the Acolyte has sustained during his service to the Emperor. 

With the GM's permission, a character may spend some of his xp to remove Insanity Points. It costs 100 xp to remove a single Insanity Point. Removing Insanity Points in this fashion does not reduce the character's Degree of Madness, meaning he will never lose any acquired disorders. It does, however, allow the character to gain some Insanity Points at a future date without increasing his Degree or Madness or acquiring new disorders. All buying back of Insanity Points should be properly represented as time and effort spent by the character in game. Possible ways of representing the removal of Insanity are:

- Prayer, fasting, penance and mortification of the flesh.
- Long-term palliative care.
- Recuperation in quiet and pleasant surroundings.
- Contemplation of the great holy works or other articles of faith (the Credo Omnissiah for example for Mechanicus characters).

Certain gear and consumables can reduce the debilitating effects of disorders, but generally cannot remove them entirely or reduce the character's Insanity Points.
##### Example
*Although he was able to escape from the Eldar Corsairs, Rylar Mane's time in their custody was singularly horrendous and he now occasionally hallucinates a spectral form of one of his torturers coming to pay him a "house call". Concerned for the health of his mind, Mane spends a not-insignificant amount of time in meditation to help re-centre himself. The GM decides that this period of rest is suitable to repair some of damage done to Mane’s mind and allows Mane’s player to spend 500xp to reduce his character’s total Insanity Points from 44 to 39. Mane is still considered to be Disturbed, but he now must gain another 21 Insanity Points (instead of the normal 16) before his visions of the vile Eldar get worse.*

*Later, Mane finds himself on the shrine world of Chilautox where he receives a regimen of highly-allaying therapy from the cloud-maidens of the Temple of Seven Virtues. In such a rarified and emollient environs the GM decides to allow Mane's player to spend down Insanity Points at only half the usual xp cost. He wisely takes advantage of this opportunity and spends another 500xp to reduce his character's total Insanity Points to 29.  He must now gain another 31 Insanity Points before his disorder increases in severity—furthermore, he learns of a sedative drug that can allow him to ignore Minor mental disorders, and invests in a good supply thereof. Mane is almost good as new!*
# **Corruption**

The most insidious threat facing humanity, and indeed the very survival of the Imperium as a whole, is the corrupting taint of Chaos. Encounters with daemons, dark rituals and even the knowledge that such things are possible are all paths to corruption. Quite aside from the malevolency and manipulation of daemons and their mortal followers, there is immense danger in exposure to the substance of the warp itself. The swirling tempest of psychoactive energies and pseudo-matter that make up the fabric of warp space is more deadly than any radiation. It can instantly destroy, but it can also inflict hideous transformations on material, body and mind, far beyond anything found in a sane universe. To most, corruption is a doom to be avoided at all costs, an irrevocable destruction of the soul itself. To others, once they find themselves walking the path to damnation, it is honeyed whispers of ultimate power, true knowledge, and whatever their heart desires most.
## **Corruption Points**

Corruption Points (CP) operate almost exactly like Insanity Points, except that they are gained through exposure to the warp, dark rituals, cursed artefacts, daemonic influence, and vile deeds. The more Corruption Points a character has, the more afflicted he becomes; this is reflected in the rules by the risk of Malignancies and Mutation as shown on **Table: The Corruption Track**.
##### **Table: The Corruption Track**

| CP Total | Degree of Corruption | Malignancy Test | Mutation    |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 01–30    | Tainted              | +0              | —           |
| 31–60    | Soiled               | –10             | First Test  |
| 61–90    | Debased              | –20             | Second Test |
| 91–99    | Profane              | –30             | Third Test  |
At 100 Corruption Points a character is hopelessly consumed by the corrosive taint of the warp. For most, this is the end—the character succumbs to their mutations or is driven to self-destruction by the accumulated malignancies their depravity has accrued. For those who have come into knowledge of the true nature of the Ruinous Powers, there may be a path to avoid wholesale destruction, but the price will be hideously steep. An Acolyte who has formally declared their eternal allegiance to Chaos would likely be removed from play, unless, of course, it was their intent to maintain a charade of faith in the God-Emperor while clandestinely serving their new dread masters...
## **Moral Threats**

The exact level of Corruption Points inflicted by a particular event, revelation or encounter is determined by the GM. The following presents some guidelines:
### **Warp Shock**

If a character suffers Insanity Points resulting from a failed Fear Test involving entities from the warp, he also gains a number of Corruption Points equal to the being's Fear Rating. For example, encountering a Bloodletter with Fear (2) and suffering warp shock from it would result in the character gaining 2 Corruption Points.
### **Rending the Veil**

Characters caught in a full-blown intrusion of the warp into corporeal reality gain Corruption Points from the experience. Just how many depends on what occurs and the severity of the breach. This might be anywhere from a single point for a fairly brief incursion to several d10s for a particularly catastrophic event.
### **Sorcery**

The practice of sorcery, witnessing dread rituals and invoking daemons are all causes of Corruption, regardless of the reason. Manifesting sorcerous powers all carry a greater risk of gaining Corruption, with some arcana inflicting Corruption on the sorcerer any time they are invoked. Participating in a minor sorcerous ritual normally inflicts 1d10 Corruption Points on all present, while a major ritual can cause many more.
### **Blasphemous Lore**

Knowledge itself can corrupt, and the study of certain tomes, pict-logs and even some debased artwork can cause Corruption in the viewer as their provocative contents render the viewer more susceptible to the warp's sinister influences.  
### **Dark Deeds**

Evil acts done in the furtherance of a malignancy, in pursuit of forbidden lore, or done to appease a daemon always cause Corruption Points. Even some more mundane acts of wickedness that are particularly pleasing to the Ruinous Powers might earn a Corruption Point.
### **Vile Persuasion**

Many daemons and cult leaders are masters of insidious temptation and of sowing the seeds of doubt in a faithful heart. Their words and arguments can corrupt where force alone would fail.
## **Refuge in Madness**

"Sanity is no substitute for zeal," a play on a common divination, is a popular saying among firebrand Ecclesiarchs. Acolytes who are fearful of the growing taint within them may find this expression to be a very mollifying prospect. By reading proscribed texts and delving into themselves through long terms of introspection, a character can rationalise their malfeasance in the eyes of the Emperor. This spiritual bolstering safeguards the soul but at the expense of the character's grip on reality. With the GM's permission, and an appropriate amount of downtime, a willing character can remove Corruption Points from himself by gaining an equal number of Insanity Points, denying the Ruinous Powers by fortifying himself in an increasingly demented mind. Such intentional measures may be drastic, but a lifetime of madness is a small price to pay compared to an eternity of damnation, and even those scarred in mind as well as body may stand with the Emperor after their death.
## **The Malignancy Test**

For every 10 Corruption Points a character gains, he must Test Willpower to see if his Corruption has manifested as literal damage to his body and soul. This roll is modified depending on the number of Corruption Points the character already possesses as noted on **Table: The Corruption Track**. If the Test is failed, the character's corruption of spirit is given form, warping him into a twisted shape more pleasing to the Dark Gods. These metaphysical and psychosomatic scars are called Malignancies, and are randomly rolled on **Table: Malignancies**. If a player rolls a result that he has already suffered for failing a previous Malignancy Test, or due to some other specific circumstance, he must roll again until a new result comes up.
##### **Table: Malignancies**

| Roll  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–10 | **Palsy:** The character suffers from numerous minor tics, shakes and tremors with no clear medical cause. Reduce his Agility by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11–15 | **Dark-hearted:** The character grows increasingly cruel, callous, and vindictive. Reduce his Fellowship by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 16–20 | **Ill-fortuned:** Whenever the character uses a Fate Point roll a d10. On a score of 7, 8, 9 or 10 it has no effect but it is lost anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21–22 | **Skin Afflictions:** The character is plagued by boils, scabs, weeping sores and the like. He takes a –20 penalty to all Charm Tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 23–25 | **Night Eyes:** Light pains the character, and unless he shields his eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty on all Tests when in an area of bright light.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26–30 | **Morbid:** The character finds it hard to concentrate as his mind is filled with macabre visions and tortured, gloom-filled trains of thought. The character's Intelligence is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 31–33 | **Witch-mark:** The character develops some minor physical deformity or easily concealable mutation. It is small, but perhaps enough to consign him to the stake if found out by a fanatical witch hunter. He must hide it well!                                                                                                                        |
| 34–45 | **Fell Obsession:** This is the same as the Obsession Disorder (see above). However, in this case the character is obsessed by a sinister or malign focus, such as collecting finger-bone trophies, ritual scarification, carrying out meaningless vivisections, etc.                                                                                   |
| 46–50 | **Hatred:** The character develops an implacable hatred of a single group, individual or social class. The character will never side with or aid them without explicit orders or other vital cause, and even then only grudgingly.                                                                                                                      |
| 51–55 | **Irrational Nausea:** The character feels sick at the sight or sound of some otherwise innocuous thing such as prayer books and holy items, bare flesh, human laughter, fresh food, shellfish, etc. When he encounters the object of his revulsion, he must Test Toughness or suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests as long as he remains in its presence. |
| 56–60 | **Wasted Frame:** The character's pallor becomes corpse-like and his muscles waste away. The character's Strength is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 61–63 | **Night Terrors:** The character is plagued by daemonic visions in his sleep. See the Horrific Nightmares Disorder above for more details.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 64–70 | **Poor Health:** The character constantly suffers petty illnesses and phantom pains, and his wounds never seem to heal fully. The character's Toughness is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 71–75 | **Distrustful:** The character cannot conceal the distrust and antipathy he has for others. He suffers a –10 penalty to all Fellowship-based Tests when dealing with strangers.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 76–80 | **Malign Sight:** The world seems to darken, tarnish and rot if the character looks too long at anything. The character's Perception is reduced by 1d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 81–83 | **Ashen Taste:** Food and drink hold disgusting tastes and little sustenance for the character, and he can barely stomach eating. The character doubles the negative effects for levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 84–90 | **Bloodlust:** Murderous rage is never far from the character's mind. After being wounded in combat, he must Test Willpower to incapacitate or allow his enemies to flee, rather than kill them outright, even if his intent is otherwise.                                                                                                              |
| 91–93 | **Blackouts:** The character suffers from inexplicable blackouts. When they occur and what happens during them is up to the GM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 94–00 | **Strange Addiction:** The character is addicted to some bizarre and unnatural substance, such as eating rose petals, drinking blood, the taste of widows' tears, etc. This acts like a Minor Compulsion Disorder (see above), but is freakish enough to cause serious suspicion if found out.                                                          |

## **Mutation**

A character's total Corruption Points are also used to determine the unnatural warping effects of Chaos upon his body. As his Corruption builds, his flesh may revolt, twisted and reshaped by the malign influence of the Ruinous Powers. 

Such is the insidious nature of Chaos that it is constantly hunting for weakness in mind and body, testing a character's defences until it can find a way into his soul. For every 30 Corruption Points a character gains, he must make a Test against two Characteristics of his choice or suffer a random Minor Mutation (see **Table: Minor Mutations** below). He may not Test against the same Characteristics twice to resist mutation. A player should make a note on his Character Sheet of which Characteristics he has already Tested to resist mutation.

Whenever a mutation occurs, roll on the appropriate Table, either Minor Mutations or Major Mutations, to discover what type of mutation is gained. Always re-roll duplicate results.
##### Example
*Ever ill fortune’s plaything, Rylar Mane discovers that the cloud-maidens of Chilautox are in fact part of a vile Chaos cult and falls afoul of one of their dark rituals. Infused with the power of the warp, Mane gains enough Corruption Points to raise his total to 31. This means he must make a Malignancy Test by rolling against his Willpower. If he fails this Test then he must roll on **Table: Malignancies** and suffer the results.*

*In addition to his Malignancy Test, reaching 30 or more CP means Mane must also test to see if he gains a mutation. He chooses his two best Characteristics, Strength and Fellowship, to roll against. If he fails either roll (or both rolls) he will gain a mutation. If Mane is unfortunate enough to later accumulate more than 60 CP, he is at risk of gaining another mutation, but he may not test against his Strength or Fellowship again. The inexorable treachery of Chaos, relentlessly searching for purchase in Mane's soul, will compel him to test against less favourable Characteristics until it finds a way in.*

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–20 | **Grotesque:** The mutant is either badly deformed, scarred or bestial, marking it as accursed and impure. The mutant takes a –20 penalty on Fellowship Tests made to interact with ‘normals’, but gains a +10 bonus to Intimidate Tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21–30 | **Tough Hide:** The mutant gains the Natural Armour (2) Trait from dense skin, thick scar tissue, or bony plates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31–40 | **Misshapen:** The mutant’s spine and limbs are horribly twisted. The mutant may no longer Run and reduces its Agility by 2d10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 41–50 | **Feels No Pain:** The mutant cares little for injury or harm. It gains +5 Wounds and the Iron Jaw talent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 51–60 | **Brute:** The mutant is physically powerful, with enormous masses of slab-like muscle. Increase its Strength and Toughness Characteristics by 10 each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 61–70 | **Nightsider:** The mutant gains keen eyesight, allowing it to see clearly in areas of low lighting. It gains the Dark Sight Trait, but takes a –10 penalty to all Tests when in areas of bright light, unless its eyes are shielded and skin covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 71–80 | **Mental Regressive:** The mutant's mind has degraded, possibly quite badly. Roll 1d10 for Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship separately. On a 1–5, reduce the Characteristic by 1d10; on a 6–7, halve the Characteristic; on an 8–9, there is no change;<br>on a 10, reduce the Characteristic to 5. The mutant also gains 1d10 Insanity Points.                                                                                                                                    |
| 81–85 | **Malformed Hands:** The mutant’s hands are fused into mitten-like appendages with very poor dexterity. Reduce its Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill by 10. Furthermore, the mutant takes a –20 penalty to any Test requiring fine physical manipulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 86–90 | **Tox Blood:** The mutant’s system is saturated with toxic pollutants and poisonous bio-chemicals. It gains a +20 bonus to Toughness Tests made to resist poison, but reduces its Toughness and Intelligence Characteristics by 1d10. Should the mutant’s blood come into contact with a living creature, such as an opponent who has inflicted Blood Loss on it, that creature must succeed on a **Difficult (–10) Toughness Test** or take 1d10 points of damage that ignores Armour and Toughness. |
| 91–95 | **Aberration:** The mutant has become a weird, if sightly, hybrid of man and animal (or reptile, insect, or some other beast). The mutant increases its Strength and Agility by +10, reduces its Intelligence by –1d10, its Fellowship by –10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 96–99 | **Wyrdling:** The mutant has a significant level of psychic ability that it has so far been able to conceal. The mutant gains the Psy Rating 2 Talent. If it already has this Talent, it instead increases its Psy Rating by +1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–25 | **Vile Deformity:** The mutant is marked by some terrible deformity that shows the touch of the Warp and should not exist in a rational universe. There is no end to the dire forms this might take such as writhing tentacles in place of arms, skinless glistening flesh, re-arranged facial features, or thousands of restless eyes studding the body, to name but a few. The mutant gains the Fear (1) Trait. |
| 26–35 | **Monstrous:** The mutant is an absolute behemoth. It gains the Hulking Size Trait, increases its Strength and Toughness Characteristics by 10 each, and gains +5 Wounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 36–40 | **Degenerate Mind:** The mutant’s mind is Warped and inhuman. Reduce its Intelligence and Fellowship each by –1d10. In addition, roll 1d10. On a 1–3, it gains the Frenzy talent; on a 4–7, it gains the Fearless talent; on an 8–0, it gains the From Beyond Trait.                                                                                                                                              |
| 41–50 | **Ravaged Body:** The mutant’s body has been entirely remade in the gloriously anarchic image of the Warp itself. Roll 1d5 times on **Table: Minor Mutations**; if a duplicate roll occurs, roll on this table instead. Such mutations, regardless of their nature, show the obvious touch of Chaos.                                                                                                              |
| 51–60 | **Clawed/Fanged:** The mutant gains razor claws, a fanged maw, barbed flesh or some other form of natural weapon. It gains the Natural Weapon Trait (either I or R Damage).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 61–65 | **Necrophage:** The mutant gains +10 to Toughness and the Regeneration Trait, but must sustain itself on copious quantities of raw meat or starve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 66–70 | **Corrupted Flesh:** Beneath the mutant’s skin a blasphemous transformation has taken place, exchanging living organs for writhing creatures and blood for ichorous, maggot-ridden filth. Whenever the mutant takes Critical Damage, it gains Fear 2 for that Round.                                                                                                                                              |
