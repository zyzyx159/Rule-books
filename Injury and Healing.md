*"Better crippled in body than corrupt in mind."* — *Lexiconum Moralis*.

A natural consequence of pursuing the God-Emperor's enemies into their lairs is getting hurt. Acolytes can get into fights with an endless array of enemies, machinery can malfunction, pilots can fail to perform manoeuvres, and careless psykers can invite all manner of warp horrors to show up and ruin everyone’s day.

Common physical injuries to ***Dark Heresy*** characters are represented by Damage and Fatigue. Additionally, characters can also experience several types of Conditions and Special Damage such as fire, suffocation, being stunned, and even the loss of limbs and other body parts.
# **WOUNDS** 

With all these different types of punishment waiting to befall you, it’s important to know how much physical abuse you can take. Wounds are the key measurement of how durable your body is, and therefore how much Damage you can take before suffering debilitating effects, crippling injuries, and ultimately death. 

Every character in ***Dark Heresy*** has a specified number of Wounds. These are generated during Character Creation, and you may be able to increase your Wounds by spending experience points on Sound Constitution Talents as your Career Advances allow. 

Wounds are not a resource that depletes, rather they serve as a threshold for when Damage becomes potentially life-threatening. When you take Damage, record the total on your character sheet as Damage. When your Damage exceeds your Wounds, you are in real trouble. 
# **DAMAGE**

Damage is the measure of physical trauma inflicted on your body. You can suffer Damage a staggering number of ways, including everything from being lacerated by a heretic's chainsword to taking a nasty tumble down some stairs. When you suffer Damage, record the amount on your character sheet. That Damage remains with you until it is removed over time by natural healing, receiving medical attention, or some other means. Damage is cumulative; each time you suffer Damage, the amount is added to any previous Damage you have.

Under normal circumstances you reduce incoming Damage by an amount equal to your Toughness Bonus. Depending on the nature of the Damage you're receiving, wearing armour can reduce the Damage further. If the source of the Damage strikes a hit location protected by armour, the incoming Damage is reduced by an amount equal to the Armour Points provided by the armour. It is important to note that some sources of Damage can ignore armour, Toughness Bonus, or both, such as weapons with Penetration, Falling Damage, and certain Psychic Powers. When applicable this will be detailed in the description of the Damage source.

As long as your total Damage is equal to or less than your Wounds you can still function normally. Once the Damage exceeds your Wounds you begin to take Critical Damage.
### **Damage Types**

All Damage is divided up into four types: Energy (lasers, fire, plasma), Explosive (frag grenades and anything else that blows up, including boltgun attacks), Impact (blunt melee weapons, solid projectile bullets, falling) and Rending (bladed melee weapons, claws and talons, and so forth). What kind of Damage a weapon or effect deals will be noted in its description. Damage types are important to note for the purposes of determining the effects of Critical Damage, the difficulty of treating your injuries through medical attention, and what sort of effect your weapon might have on the local environment.

If it is not specified what type of Damage an attack deals, count it as Impact. If it does not specify what location an attack hits, count it as the Body.
## **Critical Damage

Whenever your total Damage exceeds your Wounds, you begin to take Critical Damage. Each time you suffer Critical Damage, you also suffer one or more Critical Effects. These are determined by consulting the appropriate Critical Effect Table (see below) based on the affected hit location (Arm, Body, Head, or Leg) and the type of Damage (Energy, Explosive, Impact, or Rending).

As with normal Damage, Critical Damage is cumulative and remains with you until you either heal naturally over time or receive medical attention. Each Critical Effect also has its own duration, some of which are permanent. If you are already Critically Damaged and suffer more Damage, the
amount is added to your existing Critical Damage and a new set of Critical Effects are applied based on your total Critical Damage. This continues in this fashion each time you sustain more Damage until you you suffer a lethal Critical Effect and perish.
##### Example
*Mordechai takes a nasty hit from a ganger's axe, taking 10 points of Damage. Mordechai has only 10 Wounds, so he's already in trouble. On the next Round, the filthy ganger hits him again, dealing another 5 points of Damage (after reducing the Damage total by Mordechai's TB and Armour Points) to the head. These five points exceed Mordechai's Wounds, so they count as Critical Damage. The GM looks at the Rending Critical Effects–Head table, looks at the fifth row and announces the result. Mordechai loses his helmet and is Stunned for 1d5 Rounds. The GM rolls for the Stunned duration, getting a 3.*

*On Mordechai's next Turn, he spends a Fate Point to recover from being Stunned, then attacks the ganger. Mordechai's attack strikes true, but the Damage he inflicts doesn't exceed the ganger's Wounds, so he's "merely" Wounded. The ganger, trying to end the fight while he has the edge, lashes out with his axe and hits Mordechai again, this time dealing a mere 3 points of Damage (after TB and AP) to the body. Mordechai adds 3 Critical Damage to the 5 he's already accumulated for a total of 8. Looking at the Critical table, this time for the body, the GM reads the "8" result, "Your chest and abdomen are brutally cut into, the axe lacerating your flesh, bones and innards as it passes. You must pass a Toughness Test or die. If you pass, you take 1d10 permanent Toughness Damage, are Stunned for a Round, and now suffer Blood Loss." Unless help is about to arrive, this is likely the end for poor Mordechai.*

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | A grazing blow to the head frazzles the target's senses, imposing a –10 penalty to all Tests (except Toughness) for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2               | The blast of energy dazzles the target, leaving him Blinded for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3               | The attack cooks off one of the target's ears, leaving him with a partially burned stump of cartilage and Deafened until he receives First Aid or 1d5 hours pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4               | The energy attack burns away all of the hairs on the target's head as well as leaving him reeling from the injury. The attack deals 2 levels of Fatigue and the target is Blinded for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5               | A blast of energy envelopes the target's head, burning his face and hair, and causing him to scream like a stuck Grox. In addition to losing his hair, he is Blinded for 1d10 Rounds, Stunned for 1 Round, and takes 1 permanent Fellowship Damage.                                                                                                                  |
| 6               | The attack cooks the target's face, melting his features and damaging his eyes. The target is Blinded for the next 1d10 hours and suffers both 1d5 permanent Fellowship Damage and 1 permanent Perception Damage from his facial injuries. He also suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue as well.                                                                            |
| 7               | In a gruesome display, the flesh is burned from the target's head, exposing charred bone and muscle underneath. The target is permanently Blinded and takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue. Also, roll 1d10. This is the target's new Fellowship, unless their Fellowship is already 10 or less, in which case don't bother rolling as nobody really notices the difference. |
| 8               | The target's head is destroyed in a convocation of fiery death. He does not survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 9               | Superheated by the attack, the target's brain explodes, tearing apart his skull and sending flaming chunks of meat flying at those nearby. The target is no more.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10+             | As above, except the target's entire body catches fire and runs off headless 2d10 metres in a random direction (the Scatter Diagram to determine direction). Anything flammable it passes, including characters, must make an Agility Test or catch on fire.                                                                                                         |

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | The attack just barely grazes the target's arm, causing it spasm uncontrollably. Tests made involving the arm suffer a –30 penalty for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2               | The attack smashes into the arm, sending currents of energy crackling down to the fingers and up to the shoulder. The arm is useless for 1d5 Rounds and the character takes 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3               | The attack causes energy to course through the target's arm, leaving him Stunned for 1 Round. The arm is paralysed and useless until the target receives medical treatment sufficient to remove at least 1 Critical Damage.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4               | The shock of the attack causes the target to temporarily lose control of his autonomous functions. He is Stunned for 1 Round and knocked Prone. The arm is useless for 1d10 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5               | The arm suffers superficial burns inflicting no small amount of pain on the target. The target may only take a Half Action in his next round, and he suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6               | The attack wreathes the arm in flame, scorching clothing and armour, and partially fusing the target's fingers together. The target suffers 1d5 Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Damage and gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue. Before the target can remove any Critical Damage, such as through First Aid, he must succeed on a **Toughness Test** or lose the use of the hand permanently. |
| 7               | With a terrible snapping sound, the heat of the attack boils the marrow in the target's arm, causing the bones to crack. The target's arm is broken and until it is healed the target counts as only having one arm. The target is Stunned for 1 Round and also takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                           |
| 8               | Energy sears through the arm at the shoulder, causing the limb to be severed from the body. The target gains 1d10 levels of Fatigue and must take a **Toughness Test** or become Stunned for 1d5 Rounds. The target now only has one arm.                                                                                                                                              |
| 9               | The target's arm is burnt to a crisp right down to the bone. The target must make an immediate **Toughness Test** or die from shock. If he survives, the target takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is Stunned for 1 Round. The target now only has one arm.                                                                                                                              |
| 10+             | The attack reduces the arm to a cloud of ash and sends the target crumbling to the ground where he immediately dies from shock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 3               | The attack cooks the flesh on the chest and abdomen, inflicting 2 levels of Fatigue and 1d5 Toughness Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4               | The energy ripples all over the character, scorching his body with horridly painful burns and inflicting 1d10 levels of Fatigue. The target can take only a Half Action on his next Turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5               | The fury of the attack forces the target to the ground, helplessly covering his face and keening in agony. The target is knocked Prone and must make an **Agility Test** or catch fire. Additionally, the target must make a **Toughness Test** or be Stunned for 1 Round, which could be very unfortunate if the target is also on fire...                                                                               |
| 6               | Struck by the full force of the attack, the target is sent reeling to the ground, smoke spiralling out of the wound. The target is knocked Prone, Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, and gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue. In addition, he must make a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1d5 permanent Toughness Damage.                                                                                                                      |
| 7               | The sheer power of the energy attack cooks the target's organs, burning his lungs and heart with intense heat. The target is Stunned for 2d10 Rounds and suffers 1d10 permanent Toughness Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 8               | The target is savagely burned, his skin charring and peeling while body fat rends out of his clothing and armour. The target is Stunned for 2d10 Rounds and the terrible burns inflict Characteristic Damage equal to half his Strength, Toughness and Agility. The extensive scarring deals 2d5 permanent Fellowship Damage.                                                                                             |
| 9               | The target is completely engulfed in flame, burning to a blackened ruin inside and out. He falls to the ground a smoking heap of scorched bones barely held together by thin sheets of completely charred flesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10+             | As above, but the target's fatal combustion is such that there is a 50% chance any ammunition he's carrying explodes. Unless they can make a successful Dodge Test, all creatures within 1d5 metres take 1d10+5 Explosive Damage. If the target carried any grenades, missiles, or similar weapons those also detonate one Round later, inflicting Damage and/or other effects centred on where the target's remains lie. |

| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | The blast of energy sears the flesh and bone of the target’s leg, leaving a nasty burn. The target may not Run or Charge for 2 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2               | The attack flash-fries the skin of the target's leg. The target must pass a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3               | Intense heat from the blast sprains every tendon and ligament in the target's leg. The target reduces his Movement by half (rounding up), and the target may not Run or Charge. The effects to the target’s Movement persist until the target receives medical attention.                     |
| 4               | A solid blow to the leg sends electric currents of agony coursing through the target. The target suffers 1 level of Fatigue and reduces his Movement by half (rounding up) for 1d10 Rounds. The target is knocked Prone.                                                                      |
| 5               | The target's leg suffers severe burns, fusing clothing and armour with flesh and bone. The target gains 1 level of Fatigue and reduces his Movement by half (rounding up) for 2d10 Rounds. The target is knocked Prone.                                                                       |
| 6               | The attack burns the target's foot, charring the flesh and emitting an aroma of cooked meat. The target gains 2 levels of Fatigue and must successfully **Test Toughness** or lose the foot. On a success, the target's Movement rates are halved until he receives medical attention.        |
| 7               | The energy attack fries the leg, leaving it a mess of blackened flesh. The leg is broken and until healed the target counts as having lost the leg. The target gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue and must take a **Toughness Test** or become Stunned for 1 Round. The target now only has one leg. |
| 8               | Energy sears through the bone, causing the leg to be severed. The target gains 1d10 levels of Fatigue and is suffering from Blood Loss. In addition, the target must successfully **Test Toughness** or become Stunned for 1 Round. The target now only has one leg.                          |
| 9               | The energy discharge completely reduces the leg to ash in an instant. The target must **Test Toughness** or die from shock. The leg is utterly lost.                                                                                                                                          |
| 10+             | In a terrifying display of power, the leg immolates and the fire promptly consumes the target completely. The target dies in a matter of agonising seconds.                                                                                                                                   |

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | Concussion from the blast leaves the target confused. He can take only a Half Action on his next Turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2               | The flash and noise leaves the target Blinded and Deafened for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3               | The detonation leaves the target's face a bloody ruin from scores of small cuts. Permanent scarring is very likely. The target suffers 2 levels of Fatigue and must make a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1d10 Perception and Fellowship Damage.                                                                                                                          |
| 4               | The force of the blast concusses the target, knocking him to the ground and leaving him senseless. The target suffers 1d10 Intelligence Damage and is knocked Prone. He must also pass a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1 permanent Intelligence Damage and be stunned for 2 Rounds.                                                                                      |
| 5               | The explosion flays flesh from the target's face and shatters the bones of his inner ears with its force. The target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and is permanently Deafened. The target takes 1d5 levels of Fatigue and can only take Half Actions for the next 1d5 hours. Finally, the target suffers 1 point of permanent Fellowship Damage due to all his new scars. |
| 6               | The target's head explodes under the force of the attack. The target dies instantly,  his headless corpse seeping blood from the neck for the next few minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7               | Both head and body are blown into a mangled mess, instantly killing the target. In addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition it explodes, the fragments dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to any creatures within 1d5 metres. If the target was carrying grenades or missiles, these too explode on the target's person.                                            |
| 8               | The power of the blast rends the target's head and torso apart, leaving a steaming and shredded mess of gore on the ground. For the rest of the fight, anyone moving over this spot must make an **Agility Test** or fall Prone.                                                                                                                                        |
| 9               | The target is reduced to a puff of faintly crimson mist, leaving few if any identifiable parts left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10+             | As above, except the target's destruction is so utter and absolute that any of the target's allies or bystanders who are within two metres of where the target stood must immediately **Test Willpower** or spend their next Turn fleeing from the attacker and/or the space the target once occupied.                                                                  |

| 1               | The attack throws the limb backwards, painfully jerking it away from the body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2               | The force of the blow briefly paralyses the arm. The target drops anything held in the hand and must make a **Toughness Test** or be Stunned for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3               | The explosion takes 1d5 fingers from the target's hand. The target gains 1 level of Fatigue and 1d10 WS and BS Damage for any attacks using that hand. If the target loses 3 or more fingers the hand is considered lost until healed. Anything carried in the hand is destroyed. If this is an explosive, such as a grenade, it detonates—treat this as a result of 9 instead. |
| 4               | The blast rips the sinew of the arm straight from the bone. He is Stunned for 1 Round, and the limb is useless until medical attention is received. The target must make a **Toughness Test** or suffer Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5               | Fragments from the explosion tear into the target's hand, ripping away skin and muscle alike. He must succeed on an **Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test** or lose the hand. Even on a success, the hand is useless until medical attention is received, and the target suffers 1 permanent WS and BS Damage from damaged nerves.                                                    |
| 6               | The explosive attack shatters the bone and mangles the flesh turning the target's arm into a red ruin, inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The target's arm is broken and, until healed, the target counts as having only one arm. The wounds open up the target's veins and he now suffers from Blood Loss as well.                                                              |
| 7               | The arm is blown apart with chunks of flesh and bone fragments thrown haphazardly around. The target must immediately pass a **Toughness Test** or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 rounds, gains 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and suffers Blood Loss. He now only has one arm.                                                                          |
| 8               | The force of the explosion disintegrates the arm and most of the shoulder and chest on that side. The target collapses to the ground screaming for a few moments before dying in a pool of his own blood and organs.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 9               | The arm is completely destroyed, along with the target's head and most of their body on that side. In addition, if the target was carrying a weapon with a power source in his hand (such as a plasma gun or a chainsword) then it explodes, dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within two metres.                                                                          |
| 10+             | As above, except if the target is carrying any ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres (this is in addition to Damage caused by exploding powered weapons noted above). If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on his person.                                                                          |

| 1               | The concussion of the blast flings the target backwards 1d5 metres. The target is knocked Prone, but otherwise suffers no further injury.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2               | As above, but the target gains 1 level of Fatigue for each metre they were flung.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3               | The power of the explosion cuts deep rends in the target's flesh. The target must make **Test Toughness** or suffer from Blood Loss and be Stunned for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                           |
| 4               | The force of the blast sends the target sprawling to the ground. The target is knocked backwards 1d5 metres, Stunned for 1 Round, and is knocked Prone.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5               | Concussion from the explosion knocks the target to the ground and tenderises his innards. The target is knocked Prone and gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue, and must **Test Toughness** or begin suffering Blood Loss and 1 permanent Toughness Damage.                                                        |
| 6               | Chunks of the target’s flesh are ripped free by the force of the attack leaving large, weeping wounds. The target is Stunned for 1 Round, may only take a Half Action in his next Round, and is now suffering Blood Loss.                                                                                 |
| 7               | The explosive force of the attack ruptures the target’s flesh and scrambles his nervous system, knocking him to the ground. The target suffers Blood Loss, is knocked Prone, is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, and must make a **Toughness Test** or fall unconscious.                                          |
| 8               | The target’s chest is violently torn open by the blast, disgorging a river of partially cooked organs onto the ground and killing him instantly.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 9               | The target is completely blown to pieces, bloody gobbets landing all around. In addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on the target’s person. |
| 10+             | As above, except anyone within 1d10 metres of the target is drenched in gore and must make **Test Agility** or suffer a –10 penalty to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests for 1 Round as blood fouls their sight.                                                                                     |

| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | A glancing blast sends the target backwards one metre. The target must make a Toughness Test or be knocked Prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2               | The force of the explosion takes the target's feet out from under him. He is knocked Prone and when moving may only take Half Move Actions for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3               | The concussion badly sprains the target's leg, inflicting 2d10 Agility Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4               | The explosion flings the target 1d5 metres away, causing him to land Prone and ending up disoriented. The target's Movement is reduced by half (rounding up) for 1d10 Rounds while he gets his bearings again.                                                                                                              |
| 5               | The blast seriously wounds the target's foot. The target suffers 1 permanent Agility Damage from the injury, and must make a **Toughness Test** or gain 1d5 levels of Fatigue. If the target fails by two or more degrees he permanently loses the use of the foot.                                                         |
| 6               | The concussive force of the blast shatters the target’s leg bones and splits apart his flesh, inflicting 1d10 levels of Fatigue. The leg is broken and, until healed, the target counts as having only one leg. The target must also make an immediate **Toughness Test** or permanently lose his foot.                     |
| 7               | The explosion shreds the target's leg into a hideous ruin of bone fragments and pulverised meat. The target must immediately make a **Toughness Test** or die from shock. On a successful Test, the target is still Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, takes 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg. |
| 8               | The blast tears the leg from the body in a spray of gore, sending him crashing to the ground and pooling a huge amount of blood. He does not survive.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 9               | The leg explodes in an eruption of blood, killing the target immediately and sending tiny fragments of bone, clothing, and armour hurtling off in all directions. Anyone within two metres of the target takes a 1d10+2 Impact Damage.                                                                                      |
| 10+             | As above, except in addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate on the target's person.                                                                               |

| 1               | The impact fills the target's head with a terrible ringing noise. The target must Test Toughness or gain 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2               | The attack causes the target to see stars. The target suffers a –10 penalty to any Intelligence or Perception–based Tests for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3               | The target's nose explodes in a torrent of blood, blinding him for 1 Round. The target must make a **Toughness Test** or be Stunned for 1 Round as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4               | The concussive strike staggers the target. The target must make a **Toughness Test** or be Stunned for 1 Round and knocked Prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5               | The force of the blow violently rattles the target's head, leaving him reeling in pain. The target is Stunned for 1 Round and staggers backwards 1d5 metres. He suffers 1 permanent Intelligence Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6               | The target's head is snapped back by the attack leaving him stumbling around and badly disoriented. The target is Stunned for 1d5 Rounds and staggers off 1d5 metres in a random direction, after which he must make an **Agility Test** or fall Prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 7               | The attack slams into the target's head, fracturing his skull and opening a long tear in his scalp. The target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and halves all movement for the next 1d10 hours. In addition, the target must **Test Toughness** or begin suffering Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 8               | The blow crushes the target's head in. Blood pours from the target's facial orifices as the attack pulverises his brain. He does not survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 9               | The target's head bursts like an overripe fruit and sprays blood, bone and brain matter in all directions. Anyone within 4 metres of the target must make an **Agility Test** or suffer a –10 penalty to their WS and BS on their next Turn as gore gets in their eyes or on their visors.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10+             | As above, except that the attack was so powerful that it passes through the target and may hit another target nearby. If the hit was from a melee weapon, the attacker may immediately make another attack (with the same weapon) against any other target they can reach without moving. If the hit was from a ranged weapon they may immediately make another attack (with the same weapon) against any target standing behind the original target and still within range of their weapon. |

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1               | The attack strikes the target's limb, briefly paralysing it and causing him to drop anything held in that hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2               | The strike leaves a deep bruise, enfeebling the target's grip. The target gains 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3               | The impact inflicts crushing pain that shoots up the target's arm, causing him to gain 1 level of Fatigue and dropping whatever was held in that hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4               | The impact smashes into the target's hand, disarming him of anything he's holding and leaving the target reeling from pain. The target is Stunned for 1 Round and drops whatever he was holding with that arm. Such is the force of the blow that there is a 10 percent chance that anything the target was holding in that hand is damaged and unusable until repaired. |
| 5               | The attack batters the nerves in the target's arm leaving it paralysed. The target's arm is useless until he receives medical attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6               | The attack crushes the target's hand, breaking 1d5 fingers. The target gains 1 level of Fatigue and must immediately make a Toughness Test or suffer 2 permanent WS and BS Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 7               | With a loud snap the target's arm bones break in a nasty compound fracture, leaving the limb hanging limply at his side and bleeding badly. The target begins suffering from Blood Loss. The arm is broken, and until it is healed the target counts as having only one arm.                                                                                             |
| 8               | The force of the attack takes the arm off just below the shoulder, tossing the limb aside. The target must immediately make a **Toughness Test** or die from shock. If he passes the Test, he is still Stunned for 1d10 rounds, gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue, and is suffering from Blood Loss. He now only has one arm.                                                  |
| 9               | The force of the blow severs the target's arm and continues into the torso, inflicting a mortal blow. He twists about in agony for a few seconds before collapsing to the ground and dying.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10+             | As above, except the hit is so potent that that bits of fresh along with bone and armour fragments fly about like shrapnel. Anyone within 2 metres of the target takes 1d5 Impact Damage.                                                                                                                                                                                |

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | A blow to the target's body steals the breath from his lungs. The target can take only a Half Action on his next Turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2               | The impact punches the air from the target's body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue and knocking the target Prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3               | The attack bruises the target's ribs, leaving him Stunned for 1 Round and knocking him Prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4               | As above, but the target must also succeed on a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1d10 Toughness Damage as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5               | A solid blow to the chest violently jars the target's innards and he momentarily doubles over in pain, clutching himself and trying not to vomit blood. The target is Stunned for 2 Rounds and must make an **Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test** or gain 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                                     |
| 6               | The attack knocks the target sprawling on the ground. The target is flung 1d5 metres away from the attacker and falls Prone (if the target strikes a wall or other solid object, he stops). The target suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is Stunned for 2 Rounds.                                                                                                                |
| 7               | With an audible crack, 1d5 of the target's ribs break. The target can either lay down and stay still awaiting medical attention (a successful **Medicae Test** sets the ribs) or continue to take Actions, though each Round there is a 20% chance that a jagged rib pierces a vital organ and kills the character instantly. The target suffers 1d5 permanent Toughness Damage. |
| 8               | The force of the attack ruptures several of the target's organs and knocks him down, gasping in wretched pain. The target is knocked Prone and suffers both Blood Loss and 1d10 permanent Toughness Damage.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 9               | The force of the attack caves in the target's chest, shattering ribs and crushing his organs. The target jerks back, throwing back his head and spewing out a jet of blood before crumpling to the ground dead.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10+             | As above, except the target is thrown 1d10 metres away from the attack as well. Anyone in the target's path must successfully **Test Agility** or be knocked Prone as the target's corpse collides with them.                                                                                                                                                                    |

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1               | A blow to the leg inflicts some deep bruises. The target gains 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2               | A grazing strike against the leg slows the target. The target’s Movement is reduced by half (rounding up) for 1 Round, and he must make a **Toughness Test** or be Stunned for 1 Round and fall Prone.                                                                                                             |
| 3               | A solid blow to the leg sends lightning agony coursing through the target. The target suffers 1d10 Agility Damage and falls Prone, grasping at the injured leg.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4               | As above but the target suffers 2d10 Agility Damage and reduces all Movement by half (rounding up) for 1d5 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5               | The powerful impact radiates micro fractures in the target's leg bones, making each step excruciating. The target is Stunned for 1 Round and reduces his Movement to 1 metre until he receives medical attention. Additionally, the target must **Test Toughness** or gain 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                  |
| 6               | The attack crushes several of the small bones in the target's foot, snapping them like twigs. The target gains 2 levels of Fatigue and must make an immediate **Toughness Test** or permanently lose the use of his foot. The target's Movement is reduced by half (round up) until medical attention is received. |
| 7               | With a hideous snap the target's leg is broken, sending him to the ground mewling in pain. The target falls Prone with a broken leg and, until it is healed, he counts as only having one leg. The target gains 2 levels of Fatigue.                                                                               |
| 8               | The force of the attack tears the leg away below the knee. The target must immediately make a **Toughness Test** or die from shock. The target suffers from Blood Loss and 1d5 permanent Agility Damage. The target now only has one leg.                                                                          |
| 9               | The hit rips the leg off and shatters much of the target's pelvis along with it. The target falls to the ground and rapidly bleeds out, dying in a spreading pool of their own vital fluid.                                                                                                                        |
| 10+             | As above but such is the power of the blow that it manages to destroy both of the target's legs. The target's piteous screams drown out all conversation within 2d10 metres for the rest of the Round.                                                                                                             |

| 1               | If the target is wearing a helmet or protective mask there is no further effect. If not, the attack slices open a line on the target's face, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2               | The attack cuts open the target's scalp which immediately begins to bleed profusely. Due to blood pouring into the target's eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty to both Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill for the next 1d10 Turns. The target must **Test Toughness** or begin suffering from Blood Loss.                                                                                                           |
| 3               | The attack tears the target's helmet from his head. If wearing no helmet, the target also endures a grievous gash on the side of their head and begins suffering Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4               | The attack slices across the target's face, possibly rupturing an eye as it passes. He suffers 1d10 Perception Damage and must make a **Routine (+20) Toughness Test** or lose one eye.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5               | The attack tears the target's helmet from his head, the force of the blow leaving him Stunned for 1d5 Rounds. If the target is not wearing a helmet, the attack removes one of his ears instead, causing him to become Deafened until he receives medical attention. In this case, the target must also pass a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1 point of permanent Fellowship Damage.                           |
| 6               | The blow violently rips across the target's face, taking an important feature facial feature with it. Roll 1d10 to see what the target has lost. 1–3: Eye (see below), 4–7: Nose (1d10 permanent Fellowship Damage), 8–10: Ear (1d5 permanent Fellowship Damage, target is Deafened until he receives medical attention). In addition the target is now suffering Blood Loss and gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue. |
| 7               | In a vile splatter of skin, blood and teeth, the attack removes most of the target's face. He is permanently Blinded and has his Fellowship permanently reduced to 1d10, and also now has trouble speaking without slurring his words. In addition, the target is suffering from Blood Loss and is Stunned for 1 Round.                                                                                       |
| 8               | The blow impales or cleaves deeply into the side of the target's head, leaving blood and brains to leak out of the grievous wound. He's dead before he hits the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 9               | With a sound not unlike a wet sponge being torn in half, the target's head flies free of its body and sails through the air, landing unceremoniously 2d10 metres away with a soggy thud. The target is instantly slain.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10+             | As above, except the head is removed so swiftly that the target's neck spews blood in a torrent, drenching all those nearby and forcing them to make an **Agility Test**. Anyone who fails the Test suffers a –10 penalty to his Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests for 1 Round as gore fills his eyes or fouls his visor.                                                                                |

| 1               | The slashing attack grazes the target's arm just hard enough to knock anything free that he was holding with that hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2               | The blow leaves a painful cut on the target's hand and arm, causing him to drop whatever was held and inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3               | The attack shreds deep bloody wounds in the target's arm, causing him to scream in pain. The target drops whatever was held in that hand and must **Test Toughness** or begin suffering from Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4               | The attack flays a long strip of skin from the limb, exposing muscle and tendons. The target falls Prone from the agony and takes 2 levels of Fatigue. The limb is useless for 1d10 Rounds.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5               | A deep furrow is opened up in the target's arm. The target suffers from Blood Loss and is Stunned for 1 Round as he vomits from the excruciating pain. He drops anything held and the limb is useless without medical attention.                                                                                                                                 |
| 6               | The strike severs 1d5 fingers from the target's hand. The target is Stunned for 1 Round and must immediately pass a **Toughness Test** or lose the use of his hand.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 7               | The attack slices deeply into the target's flesh, breaking the arm bones and leaving the arm a dangling ruin precipitously weeping blood. The target suffers 1d10 Strength Damage and begins suffering from Blood Loss. The arm is broken and, until healed, the target counts as having only one arm.                                                           |
| 8               | The arm is cleanly severed from the body, flying free while trailing blood behind it in a crimson arc. The target must immediately make a **Toughness Test** or die from shock. If he passes the Test, he is Stunned for 1d10 Turns and suffers Blood Loss. The target now has only one arm.                                                                     |
| 9               | The strikes with such power that it cleaves through the arm and most of the way into the target's torso. The target dies almost instantly, the ground drenched in blood and gore as his vitals spill out.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10+             | As above, but the fingers on the severed arm spasm uncontrollably, squeezing the trigger of any held weapon. If the target was carrying a ranged weapon there is a 5% chance that a single randomly determined target within 2d10 metres will be hit by these shots, in which case resolve a single hit from the target's weapon against the unfortunate victim. |

| 1               | If the target is not wearing armour on this location, he takes 1 level of Fatigue from a shallow but painful laceration. If he is wearing armour, there is no effect. Phew!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2               | A powerful slash opens a painful rent in the target’s body. He suffers 1 level of Fatigue and must make a **Toughness Test** or be Stunned for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The target is Stunned for 1 Round and must make a **Toughness Test** or suffer from Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4               | The blow opens up a long wound in the target’s torso, causing him to double over in terrible pain as he bleeds profusely. The target suffers from Blood Loss and is Stunned for 1 Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

All characters attempting to move through this pool of blood must succeed on an **Agility Test** or fall Prone. The target suffers 1d10 Toughness Damage and also suffers Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6               | A strong hit rends a sizeable chunk out of the target and knocks him to the ground as he clutches the oozing wound, shrieking in pain. The target is knocked Prone, suffers 1d10 Toughness Damage and begins suffering from Blood Loss as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 7               | The attack cuts open the target's abdomen, missing his vital organs but only barely. The target can either choose to use one arm to hold his guts in (until a medic can bind them in place with a successful Medicae Test), or fight on regardless and risk a 20% chance each Round that his middle splits open, spilling his innards all over the ground and causing an additional 2d10 Damage. In either case, the target suffers 1d5 permanent Toughness Damage and begins suffering from Blood Loss. |
| 8               | The target's chest and abdomen are brutally cut into, lacerating his flesh, bones, and innards as it passes. The target must succeed on a **Toughness Test** or die. If he passes, he suffers 1d10 permanent Toughness Damage, is Stunned for 1 Round, and now suffers Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 9               | The powerful blow cleaves the target from gullet to groin, shredding his internal organs and spilling them on to the ground before him. The target is now quite dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10+             | The target is completely split in twain in a shower of gore. For the rest of the fight, anyone moving within four metres of the target's corpse must make an **Agility Test** or fall Prone as they slip on blood or viscera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

##### Table: Rending Critical Effects—Leg

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1               | The attack knocks the limb backwards, twisting it awkwardly. The target gains 1 level of Fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2               | The target's kneecap splits open. He must **Test Agility** or fall Prone, in which case he also begins suffering from Blood Loss as the already damaged extremity is further aggravated.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3               | The attack tears a long, ragged wound in the leg, causing blood to gush from rent flesh. The target suffers 1d5 Agility Damage and Blood Loss.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4               | The attack rends open the target's knee, causing his leg to collapse out from under him. The target's Movement speed is reduced by half (round up) until medical attention is received. In addition, he is knocked Prone and gains 1d5 levels of Fatigue.                                                                                  |
| 5               | A deep slash cuts into the target's leg, exposing bone and sinew as blood weeps from the wound. The target suffers Blood Loss and must pass a **Toughness Test** or suffer 1 permanent Agility Damage.                                                                                                                                     |
| 6               | The blow slices part of the target's foot off. The target suffers Blood Loss and must make an immediate **Toughness Test** or permanently lose the use of his foot. On a success, the target's Movement is reduced by half (round up) until he receives medical attention.                                                                 |
| 7               | A grievous wound is cut deeply into the leg, snapping bones and leaving the leg dangling uselessly as blood profusely escapes the sundered flesh. The leg is<br>broken and, until healed, the target counts as having only one leg. The target is knocked Prone, Stunned for 1 Round, and begins suffering from Blood Loss.                |
| 8               | In a single bloody stroke the leg is severed below the knee. The target must immediately make a **Toughness Test** or die from shock. On a success, the target is knocked Prone, Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.                                                                                 |
| 9               | The attack bites deeply into the leg before taking it off entirely along with most of the target's hip. The target collapses to the ground and dies in agony a few moments later.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10+             | As above, except the force of the blow is so great that it continues up through the target's torso, rending them in two. The tide of gore that spills out is so intense that, for the remainder of the battle, anyone making a Run or Charge Action within six metres of where the target fell must make an **Agility Test** or fall over. |

# **FATIGUE** 

Not all Damage is lethal in ***Dark Heresy***. Exhaustion, combat trauma, or bouts of fisticuffs can all leave you battered and discombobulated, but bodily more or less intact. Fatigue measures the amount of physical stress you can take over the course of game play. You can gain Fatigue from many sources, such as certain types of attacks, forced marching and sleep deprivation, and heavy consumption of intoxicants. 

Fatigue is measured in levels rather than points. **Having any levels of Fatigue causes you to suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests.** You can take a number of levels of Fatigue equal to your Toughness Bonus without further issues. Once you have accumulated levels of Fatigue in excess of your Toughness Bonus you collapses, unconscious, for 10–TB minutes. Once you awake from your incapacitation your levels of Fatigue revert to a number equal to your Toughness Bonus.
##### Example
*Drake has been on a forced march for several hours, causing him to take two levels of Fatigue. Finally, he arrives at the settlement of Stern Hope, and makes his way to the local dive for a cold flagon of spitbrew. Whilst quaffing the (slightly chunky) ale, he manages to get on the wrong side of Slippery Zim, a local gangster. Zim takes a swing at him with a bottle. Drake is forced to Dodge out of the way. He makes a Dodge Skill Test, and rolls 30. As Drake's Agility is 34, this would normally be a success. However, as Drake is Fatigued he would need to roll 24 or less to successfully Dodge (34–10 = 24). Too tired to leap out of the way properly, Drake gets the bottle smashed into his skull.*
### **Removing Fatigue**

Fatigue goes away on its own in time. Each hour of normal rest (time spent in states of Fatigue-induced unconsciousness do not count) removes one level of Fatigue. Eight consecutive hours of rest remove all levels of Fatigue. In this context, rest need not explicitly mean sleep, but would absolutely preclude things like combat, manifesting Psychic Powers, or any sort of strenuous activity (no Acrobatics Tests!).
# **CHARACTERISTIC DAMAGE**

Some Psychic Powers, poisons, diseases, and other hazards circumvent your Wounds and deal Damage directly to your Characteristics. Characteristic Damage cannot reduce a Characteristic below 0, although having any Characteristic reduced that low can be significantly debilitating. Should the Damage or penalty reduce the tens digit of a Characteristic, the associated bonus also drops by 1.

Consult the following entries for information on what happens if a Characteristic is reduced to 0.:

- **Weapon Skill:** You may not take Tests based on this Characteristic.
- **Ballistic Skill:** You may not take Tests based on this Characteristic.
- **Strength:** You collapse into unconsciousness.
* **Toughness:** You die.
- **Agility:** You are paralysed, helpless, and may take no Actions.
- **Intelligence:** You slip into a dreamless coma, possibly drooling on yourself in an embarrassing way. You are treated as helpless in this state.
- **Perception:** You are bereft of your senses. You suffer a –30 penalty to all Tests (except Toughness) until you recover.
- **Willpower:** You collapse into a nightmare-filled sleep and are considered helpless. When you awaken, you gain 1 Insanity Point.
- **Fellowship:** You withdraw into a catatonic state. You may not speak or take any Tests based on this Characteristic.
### **Removing Characteristic Damage**
Unless otherwise specified, Characteristic Damage is never permanent. You recover one point of
Characteristic Damage each hour, regardless of your activity level. The GM may allow certain types of medical attention to remove Characteristic Damage at a faster rate.
# **SERIOUS INJURIES AND CONDITIONS**

Common injuries—bruises, flesh wounds, and minor blood loss—are far from the only forms of bodily harm facing those who defend the God-Emperor's realms. Acolytes may find themselves set on fire, suffering broken bones, or facing loss of body parts, among other general unpleasantness.
### **Blinded**
If you are blinded you automatically fail all Tests based on vision, including Ballistic Skill Tests. You also suffer a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and most other Tests that ordinarily benefit from vision (for example, Search Tests). Blindness may be temporary, such as if you are exposed to a photon flash grenade or certain kinds of gas attacks, or permanent, if your eyes have been badly damaged or cut out. Blinded eyes can be replaced, but remember, as a member of the Inquisition you don't necessarily need sight to see the truth.
### **Blood Loss**
Blood Loss is a Critical Effect that can result from Critical Damage or other effects. While an Acolyte may find himself spilling blood with alarming frequency, Blood Loss represents an especially severe case where death by exsanguination ("bleeding out") is possible. If you are suffering from Blood Loss you have a 10% chance of dying each Round unless treated in some way to stop the bleeding. You may attempt a Medicae Test each Round to staunch the bleeding. This Test is **Difficult (–10)** if you are stationary or **Very Hard (–30)** if you are moving around, participating in combat, or otherwise engaging in some kind of strenuous activity. 

You need not perform the Medicae Test yourself. If you are unconscious, or one of your allies is a more talented chirurgeon, another character may attempt the Test. Certain gear items can inhibit or even end Blood Loss without the need for a Medicae Test.
### **Deafened**
You cannot hear at all, or at least not well enough to communicate with others. Until you recover or have this disability repaired, you will automatically fail any Skill or Characteristic Test that relies on sound, such as an Awareness Test to hear a sneaky opponent skulking up behind you. Apart from also having trouble communicating with your fellow Acolytes, the GM is free to decide whenever being deaf will have an effect in the game. Deafness may be temporary, such as being in proximity to a very loud noise, or permanent, either from injury to your ears or from chronic exposure to loud sounds.
### **Falling**
You can fall off things for all manner of reasons, though the results are usually the same—a sudden impact, which may be deadly depending on how far you've fallen. Generally you can fall from a height of 1 or 2 metres without taking Falling Damage, although the GM may rule that even a short fall like that could be injurious under certain circumstances. As a Full Action you may also Test Agility to jump down a number of metres equal to your Agility Bonus without taking any Damage from the fall. 

To work out Damage from Falling, simply roll 1d10 and add +1 per metre you have fallen. Roll percentile dice and use Table: Hit Locations to determine which part of your body hits the ground first. Armour normally offers no protection against falls, but you may still reduce the Damage with your Toughness Bonus as usual. Unless you happen to land on something sharp Falling Damage is considered Impact Damage for the purposes of Critical Damage and Effects. 

The GM should feel free to adjust the Damage total and type depending on things such as the type of surface landed upon, abnormal gravity conditions, and other specific circumstances.
### **Fire**
Being set on fire is a uniquely dire situation that can swiftly reduce you to a smouldering corpse. You suffer Damage from fire each Round in which you are exposed to it. At the beginning of each Round after the first in which you are exposed to the same source of flames, or if you are hit by a weapon with the Flame Special Quality or certain Toxic Critical Effects, you must make a **Challenging (+0) Agility Test** or come aflame yourself.

Once you are on fire you suffer 1d10 Energy Damage, with no reduction for Armour, and gain a level of Fatigue at the end of your Turn. If you were set on fire by an attack then assume the hit location struck by the attack is burning, otherwise treat this Damage as inflicted to the Body location. While on fire you must make a **Challenging (+0) Willpower Test** at the beginning of your Turn in order to be able to take Actions normally; if you fail the fear of burning to death overtakes you and you may take no Actions, spending the rest of the Round running around and screaming as you burn. Note that as this is a Fear effect Talents and Traits that give you a bonus against Fear do apply to this Test.

Assuming you've passed your Willpower Test and can act normally you can attempt to extinguish the flames. As a Full Action you can smother or pat out the fire with a **Hard (–20) Agility Test**. If you drop prone and roll around this Test becomes **Difficult (–10)** instead. The GM can adjust the difficulty of this Test up or down based on environmental conditions, such as a pure oxygen atmosphere or if there's a body of water you can leap into, or if your allies are able to assist you in putting the fire out. If you have access to any kind of fire suppression equipment this Test may be easier, or even succeed automatically. If you are successful the fire goes out, and as you suffer ongoing Damage from fire at the end of your Turn, you do not take any additional Damage either.
### **Lost Limbs**
Having one of your body parts severed from the rest of you can be life-threatening if not treated quickly (assuming it isn't your head, that's usually instant death). Should you lose a limb you begin suffering Blood Loss and must resolve that before you bleed out. Afterwards, if you have the Medicae Skill, or are being attended to by someone who does, the wound is considered sealed and you begin to remove Damage after 1d10+2 days. If you do not have any medical attention there is an 80% chance the wound becomes infected, causing you to die a horrible death after 1d10+5 days.

Assuming you survive the loss of the limb in the first place you now suffer various limitations and other side effects from no longer having that body part available to use. See below for various examples of what that might entail.
#### **Lost Hand**
You take a –20 penalty on all Skill and Characteristic Tests that rely on the use of two hands and you cannot wield two-handed weapons at all. Certain weapons, such as shields, may be able to be strapped to the handless arm. 

If you have lost your primary hand, remember that you take a –20 penalty to Tests made to attack with weapons using your secondary hand. You may begin spending xp to train your formerly secondary hand, with each 100 xp reducing the penalty by 10 (to a minimum of 0).

If you've lost both hands, either consider a new line of work that does not require the use of weapons or tools, or get someone to sharpen your teeth.
#### **Lost Arm**
Much as with a lost hand, but you cannot strap a shield to the arm since you don't have one. Additionally, you also suffer a –20 penalty to Acrobatics and Agility Tests involving balance. Losing both arms is just as bad, plus it's a bit difficult to reach those hard-to-clean spots.
#### **Lost Eye**
Losing one eye permanently reduces your Ballistic Skill by –10. In addition, you take a –20 penalty to all Skill and Characteristics Tests that rely on sight. Should you have the misfortune to lose both eyes, you become Blinded (see above). 
#### **Lost Foot**
Reduce all your movement by half (round up) and you suffer a –20 penalty to all Skill and Characteristic Tests that rely on mobility, such as Acrobatics or Dodge. Losing both feet makes it very difficult to walk, reducing your movement rate as if you only had an Agility Bonus of 1. Perhaps one of your fellow Acolytes will carry you…
#### **Lost Leg**
Treat this as a lost foot, but now you cannot use the Dodge Skill at all. Losing both legs makes you half the servant of the Emperor you were—although, you are also now half the target as well. Without the use of your legs your base movement rate is calculated as if you had an Agility Bonus of 0 and likely leaving you crawling around on the ground.
### **Stunned**
In addition to Damage and Fatigue, you may also become Stunned, leaving you staggered and unable to act for one or more Rounds. You can become Stunned due to the effects of some Psychic Powers, Critical Damage, certain weapon attacks, or being hit with a Takedown. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests to hit you while you are Stunned are considered **Routine (+20)**, and you may not make any Actions or Reactions either. Note that you are NOT considered Helpless while Stunned—you may be easier to attack, but not so easy that your opponent can effortlessly cut your throat.

If you were Engaged in Melee with an opponent and you become Stunned your opponent is no longer considered to be Engaged in Melee with you. This means your opponent may now attack you with a ranged weapon (and at Point Blank Range too!), or move away from you without your being able to make a free attack against him.
### **Suffocation**
There are many ways to suffocate. Drowning is likely the most common, but the inhalation of smoke and certain gases, as well as having a noose around your neck, also does the trick. How quickly you suffocate without breathable air depends on your activity level. If you are standing still and actively trying to conserve oxygen, you may hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your Toughness Bonus. On the other hand, if you are engaged in any kind of strenuous activity (combat, swimming, manifesting Psychic Powers and so forth) you may only hold your breath for a number of Rounds equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. 

While you are holding your breath you must Test Toughness each minute if you are conserving oxygen or each Round if you are engaged in any strenuous activity. If you fail, you gain a level of Fatigue. If you gain more levels of Fatigue than your Toughness Bonus, or you aren't able to get a new source of oxygen to breathe before you reach the end of the allotted time, you immediately fall unconscious. Assuming you still don't have a new air supply you will asphyxiate and die after a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus.
##### Example
*Shawnmaker has been trapped in an airless corridor by a fleeing Logician cultist. Knowing that his allies are nearby and armed with a lascutter, he decides to sit down and conserve his breath, trusting that they will cut through the sealed bulkhead and rescue him. Shawnmaker has a Toughness Bonus of 3, so he can hold his breath for three minutes. After the first minute of holding his breath he makes a Toughness Test and fails, taking a level of Fatigue. After the second minute he makes another Toughness Test, and because of the –10 penalty for Fatigue he fails and gains another level of Fatigue. Finally, after the third minute, Shawnmaker Tests Toughness again, this time succeeding and leaving him with two levels of Fatigue. Shawnmaker's allies will breach the sealed bulkhead any moment now, but if they don't arrive in the fourth minute he will fall unconscious and begin suffocating as he can only hold his breath for three minutes.*
### **Unconsciousness**
This condition covers any time when you have been involuntarily incapacitated, such as passing out from excessive levels of Fatigue or being knocked out by certain toxins or drugs. The duration of a state of unconsciousness is usually included in the description of the effect that caused it, but if no other duration is given, assume unconsciousness lasts for 10 minutes minus your Toughness Bonus. Note that unconsciousness is technically not the same thing as sleeping, although they do overlap quite a bit.

While unconscious you are completely unaware of your surroundings and cannot take any Actions or Reactions. Naturally you are considered Helpless in this state.
### **Useless Limbs**
If one of your limbs is paralysed, or you're suffering from a broken bone, the limb is useless and functionally treated as though it was lost (see Lost Limbs above). Paralysis could be temporary or permanent depending on the condition that caused it, while a broken bone needs to be treated to avoid the risk of losing the limb entirely.

If you're suffering from a broken bone, typically as a result of a Critical Damage Effect, you cannot naturally heal any Damage until you succeed on a Toughness Test. If you have Assistance from an ally with the Medicae Skill, this becomes a **Routine (+20) Test** instead. If the Test is successful, the limb must be held in a sling for 1d5+1 weeks, and is still treated as a lost limb during this time. Once this period has passed you regain normal use of the formerly broken limb.

If you fail the Toughness Test, the limb is just too badly damaged to be saved and must be removed to avoid a potentially deadly infection. A character with the Medicae Skill must make a
**Difficult (–10) Medicae Test** to perform the surgery. If this Test fails the limb still comes off, but the poor quality of the surgery inflicts 1d10 Damage to the limb—which very likely could be more Critical Damage. Regardless of how smoothly the procedure has gone, the attending chirurgeon must then begin to treat the wound as if it were a Lost Limb (see above), including the attendant Blood Loss from the removal of the limb!
### **Vacuum**
Exposure to a vacuum without adequate protection is absolutely deadly, and in only a matter of moments too—it is an environment completely destructive to most forms of life. 

Unless you happen to find yourself trapped in certain pieces of specialised industrial machinery you are almost certainly going to be exposed to vacuum as a result of travel on a voidship. You may be suddenly thrust into a vacuum, such as being expelled from an airlock into hard void, or can be affected slowly, such as breathable atmosphere being gradually exhausted through a hull breach. Both are deadly, the former is just much faster.

If you are suddenly exposed to vacuum you may survive unharmed for a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus. Note that unless you have an oxygen source, you will begin to suffer from the effects of Suffocation during this time. At the end of each Round after this, you suffer 1d10 Explosive Damage from depressurisation. If you are unfortunate enough to be in hard void, such as being ejected from a voidship, at the end of each Round make a Toughness Test. If you fail you also suffer 1d10 Energy Damage from the extreme cold and secondary exposure to cosmic energies. In both cases, this Damage is NOT reduced by Armour or Toughness Bonus. Should you perish whilst out in the void your corpse freezes solid after 5 Rounds, and any subsequent Damage causes your remains to shatter into thousands of blood-red ice shards.

If you are trapped in a gradually diminishing atmosphere you may survive unharmed for a number of Rounds equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. At the end of this time, you will begin to experience both Suffocation and the effects of depressurisation as detailed specifically. Until the atmosphere is completely gone you "only" suffer 1d5 Explosive Damage per Round instead of the usual 1d10 for sudden exposure.
# **HEALING**

*"Success is measured in blood; yours or your enemy's."* — *Tactica Imperialis.*

During your service to the Emperor you will inevitably suffer Damage whilst persecuting His foes. As you accumulate Damage your injuries will become increasingly severe, which (among other things) determines the time it takes for you to heal. Your injuries progress through three states: Lightly Wounded, Heavily Wounded, and Critically Wounded.
### **Lightly Wounded**
You are considered Lightly Wounded if you have taken Damage equal to or less than twice your Toughness Bonus. For example, if you have a Toughness Bonus of 3, then you are Lightly Wounded when you have taken between 1 and 6 Damage. Left to your own devices, you will naturally remove 1 Damage per day. If you spend an entire day resting—no combat, manifesting Psychic Powers, herding Grox, and so forth—you remove an amount of Damage equal to your Toughness Bonus instead.
### **Heavily Wounded**
You are Heavily Wounded whenever you have taken more Damage than twice your Toughness Bonus. Again assuming you have a Toughness Bonus of 3, you would be considered Heavily Wounded if you have taken more than 6 Damage but your Damage does not exceed your Wounds. You remove 1 Damage per week through natural healing. If you spend the entire week resting, you remove an amount of Damage equal to your Toughness Bonus. Once your Damage is equal to or less than your Toughness Bonus, you become Lightly Wounded.
### **Critically Wounded**
You are Critically Wounded whenever you have taken Damage in excess of your Wounds. Critical Damage does not heal on its own—you must receive medical attention to begin removing it. With rest and medical attention you remove 1 point of Critical Damage for each week. Once all Critical Damage has been removed, you become Heavily Wounded.
### **Medical Attention**
Medical attention is any Action by another character, or by yourself, to treat your injuries. Such efforts can range from the usage of medicinal drugs and consumables, being the recipient of a successful Medicae Test, or even benefiting from certain Psychic Powers that can remove Damage. Depending on the exact method used, medical attention can provide immediate recovery, or can improve the process of natural healing. See the Medicae Skill and Drugs and Consumables for more information.
### **Augmetics and Bionic Replacements**

Assuming you aren't marooned on a feral world, it is usually possible (and even desirable!) to replace lost or crippled body parts with bionic replacements. Depending on the quality of their construction, an augmetic body part could be better than the original flesh it's replacing—what members of the Adeptus Mechanicus call "the certainty of steel". You may even find yourself preferring to lop off a perfectly good arm or leg to gain the benefits of having a bionic one.

If you'd like to replace a missing limb but, for whatever reason, dislike the idea of your new leg being rendered in piston-driven chrome steel a fleshy vat-grown replacement may be an option as well, although this may not be quite as good as the original part it's replacing.

See Augmetics for more information about bionics and implants as well as how to obtain and attach them to your body.
