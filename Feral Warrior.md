*"I know not what they will do to the enemy, but by the God-Emperor they terrify me!"*

— Lord Luther Kronus, on the Mortressan Sythewind Regiment.

While the unnumbered ranks of the Imperial Guard form the basis of the military might on which the Imperium is founded, they are far from a homogenised fighting force. Aside from the imposition of order and standardisation of wargear the Munitorium provides, each regiment is as individual as the world that spawns it, and often the most unique are those drawn from feral worlds. The savagery of such worlds, both in terms of the constant warfare that their primitive peoples engage in and the often deadly flora and fauna encountered there, make for excellent material for breeding men and women for whom enduring danger and conflict are second nature long before a lasgun is ever placed in their hands. In many cases, regiments raised on feral worlds (and even a few death worlds and the more unstable feudal worlds) are highly sought after by the Munitorium and represent that world's only tithe to the Imperium, such is the value placed in their fighting stock. Most of these regiments have their number heavily drilled, forcibly educated and disciplined to bring them in line with Imperial Guard tactical doctrine and practices, channelling their warlike spirits in the Emperor's service. Some, though, often the most bloodthirsty and savage examples, are allowed to hold on to much of their "old ways" (with the exception of heretical beliefs) and maintain their brutal and close-combat oriented fighting styles, as it is this very savagery and skill that is their greatest asset. In these cases, the regiment, usually employed as shock troops and assault specialists, suffer heavy casualties in the breach of any war zone to which they are assigned, leaving behind a hard and veteran core of elite warriors that can often match the fury of the worst enemies of mankind, be they renegade, xenos or servant of the Ruinous Powers, blow-for-blow.

In the Calixis Sector there are a number of feral worlds that serve this purpose for the Departmento Munitorium, although the characteristics of each are very different. Of those worlds with large enough populations to make the raising of regiments a worthy exercise, Endrite's people are deemed true savages, a bloodthirsty and vicious lot. Intensely superstitious, they kill and maim over the slightest provocation, and place little value, it seems to outsiders, even on their own lives. Eminently expendable, Endrite "head-hunter" regiments are quickly rounded up and thrown into the breach when needed by the Calixis Munitorium, who ensure their loyalty with a deployment of their least subtle Commissars and a sizable contingent of Imperial preachers.

Of better mettle are the famed "Sythewind" of the feral death world of Mortressa, whose Guardsmen, armed with their ever-present hand axes, make for phenomenally adept scouts and infiltrators. The Mortressan iron-tribes are some of the most renowned hunters and beast slayers in the entire sector, as befits their survival against the veritable hordes of carnosaurs and other dangerous predators that populate their world. Ever since the sector's early days, a Sythewind regiment has been maintained and continuously (if slowly) replenished, rather than re-raised, owing to the world's relatively small population, with the few surviving veterans given special dispensation to return to their home world once their duty is done. There, they form a respected ruling class of elders who pass their knowledge and wide experience down to the young hunters of their tribe, creating a culture where to be chosen for Imperial service is the highest of honours.

Aside from these famed worlds, there are others from which savage fighters are recruited as mercenaries, swear allegiance to off-world powers and are even abducted to serve as blood sport attractions for the wealthy and jaded. Fedrid, Volnox and even ill-storied Dusk have their own hard-bitten killers to offer, while the infamous strife-torn world of Iocanthos, with its long millennia of open, unmitigated conflict, offers the Ashleen technologically adept savages whose barbarity and fury often equals or exceeds the most culturally regressed and animalistic "true" feral worlder.

#### **Becoming a Feral Warrior**

Whether a former Imperial Guardsman, or a sometime mercenary who bartered his skills to leave his world of origin, a feral warrior is a fighter who, while fully trained in modern weaponry and tactics, has embraced the savage heritage within and now wields anger and the brutal gifts his background has granted as his greatest weapon. The physical power and martial skills of the feral warrior are highly valued by Inquisitors who know that to hunt down and destroy the heretic and the abomination, they need the best and most brutal fighters of their own. Feral worlders are also by their very nature survivors, able to endure the worst hardships and not baulk in the face of injury or fear. They are used to fighting and acting independently, another asset in situations where Acolytes may well find themselves outnumbered and reliant on their own resources to prevail.

#### **Required Career:** Guardsmen.

**Alternate Rank:** Rank 3 or higher (1,000 xp). **Other Requirements:** You must originate from a Feral World.

#### **Beast Hunter (Talent)**

Many feral worlders were beast hunters long before they saw Imperial service. Of them, many come from cultures where, to survive their forbears, they had to become adept at bringing down the largest and most dangerous of prey. Such hard-won wisdom is rarely forgotten by their descendants.

Whenever you score a Critical Effect against a creature with a Size class of Hulking or larger, increase your Damage by +3. This does not apply to artificial constructs such as servitors, warp creatures such as Daemons, entities with the From Beyond trait, or things with a completely unrecognisable anatomy.

#### **Death Worlds**

Death worlds come in many varied forms, but each is ultimately inimical to human life. The kind that comes most readily to the Imperial mind is covered in a steaming endless jungles teaming with hostile life, such as infamous Mortressa in the Calixis Sector, although, they are just as likely to be ash-strewn volcanic wastelands, or planets ravaged by terrible nuclear holocausts or where ancient and virulent diseases run unchecked and unstoppable. Such worlds are almost impossible to colonise, but often, through abandonment or sheer bloody-mindedness, humanity has managed to survive there in limited numbers despite the odds. The battle for survival is only won at the cost of civilisation in many cases, with most human native populations sunk to the level of feral hunter-gatherers.

Some Death worlds are inhabited regardless of the risk owing to the presence of valuable resources, or held at all costs for strategic reasons. One such world is Haddrak on the edge of the Adrantis Nebula, a world where vast sulphurous seas have poisoned the land and acid storms driven by hurricane-force winds can strip flesh from bone in moments. Yet even on Haddrak life endures. Here the Adeptus Mechanicus of the Sollex sect are based, drawn to the world by its unique crystalline deposits, their black basalt fortress stabs up through to burning skies like a clawed hand. Life, needless to say, for the unfortunates born, stationed or shipped to a death world is unutterably hard and perilous, and almost without exception only those strong both in body and mind survive.
